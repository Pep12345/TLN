<p> ' Is it ok to eat fruit and meat at the same meal? I know some dietitians/nutritionists recommend you separate these at meal times, just wanted to know your thoughts' </p>
<p> The concept of not eating meat with fruit comes from the theory of food combining, which promotes the eating of certain foods together. It is based on the theory that certain foods create an acid or alkaline environment in the stomach, and that it is harder to digest a food in an alkaline environment that normally requires an acidic environment and vice versa. </p>
<p> I'm not convinced by the food combining theories based simply on how the digestive process works. </p>
<p> So, let's look at the digestive process and see if we can unravel this one logically. </p>
<p> Digestion of starches begins in the mouth with salivary amylase. This continues until the starch has reached the stomach, where the amylase becomes inactive due to the acidic environment. Complete digestion of carbohydrates does not occur until it has passed through the stomach and enters the small intestine this is normal. </p>
<p> Gastrin is stimulated at the commencement of a meal and this signals the stomach to secrete its gastric acid which includes Hydrochloric Acid, Pepsin, Intrinsic Factor and gastric lipase. This is where your fats and proteins begin digesting. No fruit busting enzymes are released at this time. Even if you eat your fruit on its own, it still won't be digested until it gets to the small intestine, that's just how the body works. </p>
<p> The stomach then churns these digested proteins and fats and partially digested starches and undigested fruits into a liquid called Chyme which is released over a 2 hour period into the small intestine. Chyme, along with Gastric acid has an acidic pH, so I'm not quite sure where food combiners get their theories on stomachs becoming alkaline. </p>
<p> In the small intestine (around 2 hours after our meat and fruit meal) bile, pancreatic lipase pancreatic amylase and proteases digest our proteins, fats and carbohydrates into their single molecules including, but not exclusive to, glucose, amino acids, monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids. Sucrose in fruit is digested by the enzyme sucrase and produces fructose and glucose molecules. Fructose in fruit passes through the whole digestive process unchanged where it enters the portal vein and heads off to the liver. The pancreatic secretion also includes bicarbonate which neutralises the acidic chyme, thus enabling enzymes to finish the digestive process. </p>
<p> To say that meat and fruit can't be digested together is true, but only because your body isn't going to digest them in the same place anyway its simply not set up to do this. But to say that you aren't digesting properly by eating both meat and fruit together is simply untrue. </p>
<p> Your meat will be digested first in the stomach and then in the small intestine. Some of your fruit will be digested in the small intestine, with the rest of it not needing any digestion at all. The stomach will be acidic and the small intestine will be more alkaline, which again is normal and all part of digesting all foods. </p>
<p> If something is causing excessive flatulence, bloating, cramping, reflux in the stomach there are other things to look at such as: </p>
<p> Low digestive acid secretion (and this can be a result of a number of different causes) </p>
<p> Hiatal Hernia, candida, H Pylorus bacteria </p>
<p> So go ahead enjoy your fruit and meat, no need to take apricot chicken, ham steaks with pineapple and pork with apple sauce off the menu just yet. Just listen to your body. Stacey 19 April 10 </p>

<p> 7 Foods To Never Eat Past The Expiration Date </p>
<p> We’ve all been there — you’re in your refrigerator looking for something to eat, and come across food you forgot you even purchased. The food is a little past its expiration date, but appears free of mold and rancid smells. Unfortunately, looks and smells can be deceiving. There are some foods you should never eat past the expiration date, like fresh meat, seafood, produce, eggs, and dairy. </p>
<p> Typically, the more refined and processed a food item is, the longer its shelf life. Fresh and minimally processed foods do not have this luxury, and must be eaten by their expiration dates to pose less of a health risk to consumers. That means the week-old pint of blueberries sitting in the back of your fridge has got to go. </p>
<p> Regardless of the date, it’s important to properly store and handle perishable foods. Items left out for more than two hours at room temperature can become hazardous to eat, even if the expiration date is days away. Refrigeration can stop bacteria growth, and freezing food can stop bacteria from growing all together, so make sure you are storing your food properly. </p>
<p> When it comes to food safety, it's always best to play it safe — because food poisoning is not sexy. Here are seven specific food items you should never eat past the expiration date. </p>
<p> 1. Deli Meat </p>
<p> So, about listeria. Listeria is a bacteria that thrives in soil, water, and in some animals. It can also be found at food processing plants, where deli meat and other processed meats, like hot dogs, get cooked and packaged. Unlike other bacterias, listeria can multiply in cold environments (i.e. your fridge). It's best to toss opened deli meat after three to five days in the fridge. If you haven't opened it, throw it away after two-weeks. </p>
<p> 2. Eggs </p>
<p> We all know what a rotten egg smells like, but how can you tell with an un-cracked egg? Easy! See if it floats in a bowl of cold water. Fresh eggs will sink to the bottom, while rotten eggs will float on top. As an egg ages, fluid evaporates through the porous shell, while air and gasses penetrate in. As a rule of thumb, keep eggs no longer than five weeks after purchasing. </p>
<p> 3. Fresh Berries </p>
<p> Picture this — you know you have a carton of strawberries in the back of the fridge just waiting to be devoured. Unfortunately, microscopic mold spores have taken a bite first, and have turned your berries into fuzz and mush. To delay the growth of mold, wash berries right before you consume them. Otherwise, fresh berries can be consumed up to three days in the refrigerator. </p>
<p> 4. Mixed Greens </p>
<p> Prepackaged salad mixes may be a convenient way to eat your greens, but they can harbor dangerous bacteria from process and handling contamination. Obviously, severely wilted and slimy greens are a no go, but unopened lettuce can only last three to five days past its sell-by date. </p>
<p> 5. Raw Seafood </p>
<p> Fresh fish and shellfish should be eaten within two days of purchase, and kept in the refrigerator. If you plan on eating the seafood past those days, wrap it tightly, and store it in the freezer for up to six months, depending on its fat content. Oily fish, such as salmon and tuna, can turn rancid if not stored properly. </p>
<p> 6. Raw Meat </p>
<p> Beware of the pink slime. Foul smells and a slimy appearance are key indicators that your ground meat has gone bad. Raw ground meat, including poultry, can be refrigerated for up to two days, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Roasts, steaks, and chops can be kept in the refrigerator for up to five days. Frozen meat can be stored up to four months. </p>
<p> 7. Soft Cheese </p>
<p> The shelf life of cheese depends on a number of factors, including the type of cheese, the processing method, and its exposure to heat. Hard and semi-hard cheeses like Parmesan and cheddar will last longer than semi-soft and soft cheeses such as Monterey Jack and Brie. Stored in the refrigerator, opened hard cheese varieties will last between three and six weeks, while opened soft cheese varieties will last for a week. </p>

<p> 10 Foods to Eat During Diverticulitis Flareups </p>
<p> Diverticular disease is a gastrointestinal disease that occurs when pouches—called diverticula—form along the digestive tract, usually near or in the colon. This disease becomes more common with age, especially in Americans over the age of 60. Other risk factors for diverticular disease are smoking, not drinking enough water, medications, lack of exercise, obesity, and straining during bowel movements. </p>
<p> Diverticulitis is the flare up or attack of symptoms caused by an attack to the diverticula. Diverticulitis occurs when the diverticula become blocked with waste. Bacteria then begins to build up causing swelling and infections. Some symptoms include acute pain in the abdomen, nausea, fever, and bloody bowel movements. The root of diverticulitis is unknown, therefore there is no specific list of foods to eat in order to ease symptoms. However, once a flare up does occur, there are certain foods you can eat that will help avoid bowel movements in order to give the diverticula a chance to heal and the infection to clear up. </p>
<p> During the flare up, you’ll want to avoid as much fiber in your diet as possible as fiber creates waste that can irritate the infection even further. Once the attack is over and you’re feeling better, you can switch back to a high-fiber diet to help avoid future attacks. </p>
<p> Disclaimer: Before starting any new diet, please consult a physician. </p>
<p> Broth </p>
<p> During a flare up, your physician will more than likely prescribe a clear-liquid diet to avoid creating waste in the intestines. This includes soup broth without pasta, rice, or vegetables, but it is advised that tomato soup be avoided. </p>
<p> Fruit Juices </p>
<p> Once a flare up eases a bit, your doctor may ease up on dietary restrictions by advising you to switch to an all-liquid diet. Fruit juice is a great option as long as there is no pulp in it as the pulp may contain fiber. </p>
<p> Low-Fiber Cereals </p>
<p> Once the symptoms ease a bit more, you may be advised to begin an extremely low-fiber diet to further limit bowel movements until the attack is completely gone. Cereals like cream of wheat and cream of rice are healthy, low-fiber choices. </p>
<p> Dairy </p>
<p> Most dairy products have little to no dietary fibers and are safe to consume during a diverticular attack. </p>
<p> White Rice and Pasta </p>
<p> White rice and pasta have very little dietary fiber and are softer on the digestive system. Avoid eating gluten-free options, however because these tend to have higher fiber counts. </p>
<p> Eggs </p>
<p> Scrambled, fried or poached; it doesn’t matter because eggs have zero dietary fiber. You can even add in vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, and asparagus since those veggies tend to have small amounts of fiber. </p>
<p> Fish </p>
<p> Flounder, salmon, crappie, or bass? Whichever you prefer is fine because all fish species are fiber-free, not to mention tasty! </p>
<p> Vitamin D </p>
<p> A study in 2013 found that those with the lowest Vitamin D levels were significantly more likely to develop a diverticulitis flare up. Make sure to have your levels checked to ensure that you’re getting enough of this all-important vitamin or you may need to add a supplement. </p>
<p> Canned or Cooked Vegetables </p>
<p> According to mayoclinic.com, well-cooked vegetables with the skin and seeds removed are more easily digested. Canned vegetables will have less fiber than their fresh counterparts. </p>
<p> Poultry </p>
<p> The name of the game during a flare up is avoiding fiber at all costs! Therefore, eating unprocessed meat and poultry are safe as they contain zero fiber. However, avoid red meats and pork as they are tougher on the digestive system. </p>

<p> 10 frozen food safety myths, debunked </p>
<p> From pasta sauce to poultry, here's how to keep frozen food safe to eat and delicious. </p>
<p> Make sure that frozen foods are wrapped well or in a tightly sealed container.Brian Klutch / Getty Images </p>
<p> Oct. 4, 2017, 8:14 PM UTC / Updated Oct. 8, 2020, 12:06 PM UTC / Source: TODAY </p>
<p> By Megan O. Steintrager </p>
<p> You've probably heard a lot of so-called rules when it comes to frozen food. </p>
<p> For example, maybe you've been told that ice cream has gone bad once you see those crystals form or that you should never thaw and then refreeze meat. </p>
<p> But do you know which of those facts are true and which ones you can toss out ... along with that mystery meat that's been in the back of your freezer for five years? </p>
<p> For definitive answers to some common questions about keeping frozen food healthy and tasty, TODAY Food consulted two experts: chef Jennifer Stack, RDN, who teaches nutrition and food safety at the Culinary Institute of America, and Lauren Sucher, a press officer for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p>
<p> Together, they've got answers to some of your most burning questions about everything frozen. </p>
<p> "Never thaw food at room temperature, such as on the counter top," advised Sucher. "Food must be kept at a safe temperature during thawing. That means leaving any raw poultry, raw beef or any other food you wouldn't leave sitting out on the counter is a bad idea. </p>
<p> "There are three safe ways to defrost food: in the refrigerator, in cold water and in the microwave. Food thawed in cold water or in the microwave should be cooked immediately." </p>
<p> Related </p>
<p> If you thawed the food in the refrigerator, you generally have between one to five days to cook it. "Once ground meat, stew meat, poultry or fish are thawed, cook them within a day or two," said Stack. "Red meat roasts and steaks can stay in your refrigerator for three to five days before you need to cook them." </p>
<p> This is a common misconception, but the experts say that if you're still in the safe window for cooking and eating meat, poultry or fish, it's perfectly safe to refreeze them, provided that the foods were thawed in the refrigerator and kept cold (40°F or below). "Refreezing the food might result in undesirable changes in texture and some loss of flavor but it will be safe to eat," said Stack. </p>
<p> Yes, but mostly no. "Frozen foods can be kept in your freezer indefinitely and still be safe to eat ... assuming they stayed frozen solid the whole time," said Stack. "However, they might not taste very good or have a strange texture that makes them unappealing." She said that fresh, whole roasts, steaks and whole chickens will keep their quality for up to a year, but once meats are cut into pieces, their quality freezer life drops to four to six months. Other meats, such as sausage, lose quality after just two months. </p>
<p> The FoodKeeper app is a super handy tool that gives timelines for freshness and quality for foods stored in the refrigerator and freezer. TODAY Health also has guidelines for how long you can freeze different foods. </p>
<p> Ice crystals form on food after that food has gotten warm and begun to defrost; then gets refrozen. "Once they get cold again, ice crystals start to form and the food (like ice cream) gets that off flavor and icy texture," explained Stack. </p>
<p> When you buy frozen food, choose packages that do not obviously have ice crystals, since this may indicate that the food has partially defrosted and then refrozen. For bagged frozen foods, give the bag a squeeze to test for freshness. "Frozen peas, corn, beans, berries and small pieces of fish like shrimp and scallops should not be a solid block of food," said Stack. "This may also be a sign of defrosting and refreezing for these foods." </p>
<p> Make sure that frozen foods are wrapped well or in a tightly sealed container. And make sure to keep them cold. "Your frozen foods will keep their quality longer if they are kept in the coldest part of the freezer, such as the bottom or the back of the freezer," said Stack. "The side door storage areas usually get a little warmer so the food might soften or start to defrost." </p>
<p> While you can safely freeze any food, some foods just don't freeze well. Stack's "don't freeze" list includes salad greens, meat salads made with mayonnaise (e.g. chicken salad), whole eggs and egg yolks and custard pies. So you're gonna have to eat that whole custard pie (or keep it in your fridge for up to five days). While you can freeze milk and cheese, "they may have some changes in their texture," said Stack. </p>
<p> Related </p>
<p> Sorry, nope. "Freezing food will not kill germs, but rather slow the growth," Sucher said. "If a food product is about to expire and you decide to freeze it, the day that you pull it out of the freezer for thawing will restart the clock where you stopped it upon freezing the food. Refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared food, and leftovers within two hours." </p>
<p> Good news! The experts say "no" with some caveats. "If the power in your home goes out, keep the freezer door closed so the inside of the freezer stays as cold as possible," said Stack. Thawed or partially thawed foods that were in your freezer can be safely refrozen if the food has not gone above 40°F. You may see some changes in the quality of the food but it will still be safe to eat. Any food that has thawed and was above 40°F for more than two hours should be thrown out. </p>
<p> Nope, not at all! "The good news about frozen foods is they retain their nutritional value and may be higher in some vitamins than foods like vegetables that were harvested many days before you but them and eat them," said Stack. </p>

<p> The 10 Worst Foods to Eat in the Morning </p>
<p> Although it may be true for some people, others actually do better when they skip breakfast. </p>
<p> Additionally, eating an unhealthy breakfast can be far worse than not eating at all. </p>
<p> A healthy breakfast includes fiber, protein and healthy fat that gives you energy and makes you feel full. </p>
<p> In contrast, an unhealthy breakfast can make you feel sluggish, cause you to gain weight and increase your risk of chronic disease. </p>
<p> Here are the 10 worst foods you can eat in the morning. </p>
<p> 1. Breakfast Cereals </p>
<p> Many people think breakfast cereals are a nutritious choice for children and adults. </p>
<p> Cereal packages often include health claims, such as “contains whole grains.” A label may also suggest the cereal is a good source of nutrients like vitamin A and iron. </p>
<p> In reality, these cereals are highly processed and contain only a small amount of whole grains. Also, nutrients are artificially added in a process called fortification. </p>
<p> One study found that children who consumed a fortified breakfast cereal designed to improve immune function ended up getting sick just as often as children who didn’t consume the cereal (1). </p>
<p> Breakfast cereals contain mostly refined (not whole) grains and sugar. </p>
<p> In fact, sugar is usually the first or second item in the ingredients list. The higher on the list, the greater the quantity. </p>
<p> A 2011 report by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) examined some of the most popular breakfast cereals consumed by children. It found that a 1-cup serving often contains more sugar than 3 chocolate chip cookies. </p>
<p> Even “nutritious” cereal choices, such as granola that contain oats, are often loaded with sugar. </p>
<p> A high sugar intake may raise the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other chronic health conditions (2). </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Many breakfast cereals are even higher in sugar than cookies and desserts. Adding whole grains or artificial vitamins and minerals does not make them a healthy choice. </p>
<p> 2. Pancakes and Waffles </p>
<p> Pancakes and waffles are popular choices for weekend breakfasts at home or in restaurants. </p>
<p> Both pancakes and waffles contain flour, eggs, sugar and milk. They are cooked somewhat differently, however, in order to achieve a distinct shape and texture. </p>
<p> Although they have more protein than some breakfast items, pancakes and waffles are very high in refined flour. Many researchers believe that refined grains like wheat flour contribute to insulin resistance and obesity (3, 4). </p>
<p> In addition, pancakes and waffles are typically topped with pancake syrup, which contains high-fructose corn syrup. </p>
<p> High-fructose corn syrup can cause the inflammation that drives insulin resistance, which may lead to prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (5). </p>
<p> Pure maple syrup is a better choice than pancake syrup, but it’s still high in sugar, which adds empty calories to the meal. </p>
<p> According to the American Heart Association, most people consume 2–3 times the recommended daily upper limit for added sugar (6). </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Pancakes and waffles are made from refined flour and topped with high-sugar syrups. They may promote insulin resistance and increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other diseases. </p>
<p> 3. Toast With Margarine </p>
<p> Toast topped with margarine may seem like a good breakfast choice, since it doesn’t contain saturated fat or sugar. </p>
<p> However, this is actually an unhealthy breakfast for two reasons. </p>
<p> First, because the flour in most bread is refined, it provides you with few nutrients and little fiber. </p>
<p> Because it is high in refined carbs and low in fiber, it can spike your blood sugar levels very fast. </p>
<p> Elevated blood sugar leads to rebound hunger that causes you to eat more at the next meal, which can make you gain weight (7). </p>
<p> Second, most margarines contain trans fats, which are the most unhealthy type of fat you can eat. </p>
<p> Food manufacturers create trans fats by adding hydrogen to vegetable oils in order to make them appear more like saturated fats, which are solid at room temperature. </p>
<p> While studies have not shown saturated fats to cause harm, trans fats are definitely bad for you. There’s a massive amount of evidence that trans fats are highly inflammatory and increase your risk of disease (8, 9, 10, 11). </p>
<p> Also keep in mind that margarine can be labeled “trans fat free” but still contain trans fats, as long as it is less than 0.5 grams per serving (12). </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Toast with margarine raises your blood sugar and insulin levels, causes rebound hunger and increases your risk of weight gain and heart disease. </p>
<p> 4. Muffins </p>
<p> Despite a reputation for being healthy, most muffins are just small cakes in disguise. </p>
<p> They’re made from refined flour, vegetable oils, eggs and sugar. The only healthy ingredient is the eggs. </p>
<p> In addition, commercially sold muffins are often very large. One review found that a typical packaged muffin exceeds the USDA standard portion size by 333% (13). </p>
<p> The dramatic increase in portion sizes over the past 30 years is believed to play a major role in the obesity epidemic. </p>
<p> Sometimes muffins are topped with additional sugar, or filled with chocolate chips or dried fruit, further adding to their sugar and calorie content. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Muffins are usually high in refined flour, refined vegetable oils and sugar, all of which are very unhealthy. </p>
<p> 5. Fruit Juice </p>
<p> Fruit juice is one of the worst choices you can make if you’re trying to avoid hunger, weight gain and chronic disease. </p>
<p> Some fruit juices on the market actually contain very little juice and are sweetened with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. High sugar levels increase your risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and other diseases (14, 15, 16). </p>
<p> Even 100% fruit juice contains a lot of sugar. Consuming large amounts of fruit juice can have the same effects on your weight and health as drinking sugar-sweetened beverages (17). </p>
<p> Drinking fruit juice causes your blood sugar to rise very quickly because there’s no fat or fiber to slow down absorption. The resulting spike in insulin and drop in blood sugar can make you feel tired, shaky and hungry. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Despite a reputation for being healthy, fruit juice is very hign in sugar. It actually contains a similar amount as sugary soda. </p>
<p> 6. Toaster Pastries </p>
<p> Toaster pastries are an undeniably quick and easy breakfast option. However, their ingredients are anything but healthy. </p>
<p> For instance, Pop Tarts contain white flour, brown sugar, high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil. </p>
<p> The health claim “baked with real fruit” is highlighted on the front of the box, in an attempt to persuade you that these pastries are a nutritious breakfast choice. </p>
<p> In addition to being high in sugar and refined flour, toaster pastries only have a couple of grams of protein. </p>
<p> One study showed that women who ate a breakfast with 3 grams of protein and 44 grams of carbs were hungrier and consumed more at lunch than women who ate a high-protein, low-carb breakfast (18). </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Toaster pastries are high in sugar and refined carbs, yet low in protein, which can increase hunger and food intake. </p>
<p> 7. Scones With Jam and Cream </p>
<p> Scones topped with jam are truly more like dessert than a meal. </p>
<p> Scones are made by mixing refined wheat flour, butter and sugar with desired flavorings. The dough is then shaped into small rounds and baked. </p>
<p> They’re usually topped with cream and jam or jelly. The end result is a high-calorie, sugary breakfast with little fiber and protein. </p>
<p> Studies have shown that fiber has many benefits, including keeping your blood sugar well-controlled. It also makes you feel satisfied so you end up eating less (19). </p>
<p> On the other hand, eating a breakfast that’s high in refined carbs can spike your blood sugar and make you hungrier. </p>
<p> In one study, obese children reported feeling hungrier and less satisfied after eating a high-carb meal than after eating a high-protein, low-carb meal. Their hunger and satiety hormones also changed (20). </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Scones topped with cream and jam provide little nutrition other than calories. Easily digested carbs and a lack of fiber can drive hunger, leading to increased food intake and weight gain. </p>
<p> 8. Sweetened Non-Fat Yogurt </p>
<p> A bowl of plain, whole-milk Greek yogurt topped with berries is a great example of a healthy breakfast. </p>
<p> However, a container of fat-free, sugar-sweetened fruit yogurt is not. </p>
<p> In fact, many flavored non-fat yogurts contain more sugar than a comparable serving of ice cream. </p>
<p> Fat helps keep you full because it takes longer to digest than carbs, and it also triggers the release of the fullness hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) (21). </p>
<p> Removing the fat from dairy products and adding sugar changes a nutritious breakfast option into a food that is better suited as an occasional treat. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Non-fat sweetened yogurt is very high in sugar, and may contain more of it than ice cream. It also lacks the natural dairy fat that can increase fullness. </p>
<p> 9. Granola Bars </p>
<p> Granola bars may sound like great breakfast options, but they’re often no better than candy bars. </p>
<p> Although unprocessed oats are high in fiber, granola bars provide only 1–3 grams of fiber, on average. However, they contain a lot of added sugar. </p>
<p> In fact, some of the most popular brands contain a combination of sugar, corn syrup and honey. Large amounts of these sugars can raise blood sugar, insulin levels and inflammation (22). </p>
<p> Further driving up their sugar content, granola bars sometimes contain chocolate chips or dried fruit. </p>
<p> The protein content of granola bars also tends to be low, further confirming that they are a poor breakfast choice. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Granola bars usually contain several types of sugar that negatively affect blood sugar and insulin levels. They also lack protein and fiber. </p>
<p> 10. Processed, Gluten-Free Breakfast Foods </p>
<p> Gluten-free diets have become very popular in recent years because of concerns about the potential negative health effects of gluten (23). </p>
<p> While there’s no harm in avoiding gluten, eating many of the processed gluten-free foods now available may cause problems. </p>
<p> For example, a combination of flours made from rice, potatoes and tapioca replaces wheat flour in gluten-free bread and baked goods. </p>
<p> These flours have a high glycemic index, so they raise blood sugar rapidly. This rise leads to high insulin levels that can cause rebound hunger and weight gain (24). </p>
<p> Also, gluten-free pancakes, muffins and other baked goods are no better than traditional wheat-based versions due to their low protein and fiber content. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Gluten-free packaged foods are made with flours that raise blood sugar, which may lead to elevated insulin, increased appetite and weight gain.They also lack protein and fiber, which contribute to fullness. </p>
<p> Take Home Message </p>
<p> Breakfast has the potential to set you up for a day of great energy levels, stable blood sugar and control over your appetite and weight. </p>
<p> On the other hand, making a poor choice at breakfast can leave you hungry and struggling to get through the rest of the day. </p>
<p> It can also increase your risk of developing health problems in the future. </p>
<p> If you’re going to eat breakfast, make it one that contains protein, healthy fat and fiber from unprocessed, whole foods. </p>

<p> Often, fish eat other fish, as most of the inhabitants of the ocean are predators. They eat each other: the big fish will hunt the smaller one someday and eat the fish that will be even bigger. Some eat plankton, and some eat everything they find in the ocean floor. </p>
<p> Diet of fish according to their classifications </p>
<p> So, what do fish eat? The fish diet is very diverse: some are meat eaters who eat marine animals, including small fish, worms, and crustaceans. Some species of fish feed on small organisms and plants, other predators that eat other fish. The diet of fish depends on their classifications. </p>
<p> Also, fish can eat detritus and algae. The composition of detritus includes coral mucus and other organic substances. Over time, it accumulates on the seabed. </p>
<p> A bright example of those fish that eat meat and plants is Angelfish. These fish also eat sponges. Sponges make up a large part of their diet as well as shrimps. </p>
<p> READ ALSO: What is the difference between sea and ocean? </p>
<p> Fish that eat both meat and plants can survive on almost any food they get from the bottom of the sea. Their feed consists of small fish, crustaceans, worms and almost anything that is not poisonous to them. </p>
<p> Besides, there are species of meat-eating fish that hunt other species by surprise attack. To catch live prey, they have to go hunting so, for example, swordfish and sailboat use their sword weapons. With a sword, they kill or maim the fish and then pick it up with their mouth. </p>
<p> Do you know what the largest fish in the ocean eat? Do you think that its diet consists of big fish? You will be surprised to learn that the biggest fish in the ocean, the whale shark, eats plankton, squid, and other small ocean animals. It floats with a huge mouth open and filters food with gills. Despite the fact that it is called shark this fish does not hunt large prey. </p>
<p> The great white shark, on the contrary, is a great hunter and prefers large prey, including other sharks. </p>
<p> Aquarium fish diet </p>
<p> As for pet fish, they can be both meat eaters and vegetarians. They are often omnivorous, carnivorous, or herbivorous. Therefore, make sure that your fish belong to one of this category to feed it accordingly. </p>
<p> Please note! Some aquarium fish owners feed their fish from the ocean with beef. You should understand that it is not recommended, because the fish hardly digests such feed. Instead, you need to give the fish a little more treats, such as flies and worms. Such fish food can be bought in any pet store. </p>
<p> Finally, thHow to make fish feed at homez?fish eat insects? Conclusion ocean species mostly eat zooplankton, other fish, algae, sponges, fish eggs and larvae, jellyfish, worms, crustacean and yes, floating insects, but not insects we get used to on the surface. </p>

<p> Maintaining your overall health and longevity could all depend on how many fruits and vegetables you get every day. </p>

<p> What Really Happens to Your Body When examines the head-to-toe effects of common behaviors, actions and habits in your everyday life. </p>
<p> If your mind skips over the popular slogans "five a day" and "eat the rainbow," you may not be getting enough fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p> Not to be a downer, but that could be seriously harming your health in more ways than one. Here's what really happens to your body when you don't eat enough fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p> Are You Getting Enough Fruits and Veggies? </p>
<p> Track the number of fruits and vegetables you eat every day by logging your meals on the MyPlate app. Download now to fine-tune your diet today! </p>
<p> Your Weight Might Go Up </p>
<p> Let's just get this one out of the way: Not eating enough fruits and vegetables could be the reason why you can't lose weight or the reason you've seen your weight creeping up over the years. </p>
<p> There are a few reasons behind this. When you eat more fruits and vegetables, there's less room in your diet for other foods that may be unhealthy (think: the potato chips alongside your lunch or those late-night brownie bites). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Fruits and vegetables are also high in fiber and water and low in calories, which means they keep you full without providing excess calories. </p>
<p> Getting the recommended amount (or more) of fruit and vegetables each day is associated with a decreased risk of becoming overweight — and increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet is linked with weight loss, according to November 2018 research in ​Nutrients​. </p>
<p> Your Gut May Be Out of Whack </p>
<p> A healthy gut is the key if you're trying to improve your health. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Gut diversity, or an increased number and type of bacteria in your gut, is essential to keeping your immune system healthy. Fiber seems to be the number one indicator affecting gut diversity, according to the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. </p>
<p> Fiber, which is a carb found in plant foods (aka fruits and vegetables), helps promote the growth of good gut bacteria. </p>
<p> So, what does not eating enough produce mean for your gut? Without these plant foods in your diet, you may not have the healthiest gut, which might make you more susceptible to illness, per the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. </p>
<p> It's Linked to an Increased Risk for Type 2 Diabetes </p>
<p> The development of type 2 diabetes happens over time. </p>
<p> It's caused by a myriad of issues within the body, but a recent July 2020 study published in the ​BMJ​ observed that those with the highest levels of vitamin C in the body have the lowest risk of developing type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p> While this doesn't imply cause and effect, the association is clear enough for us to go ahead and reach for an orange. </p>
<p> A June 2021 study in ​The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism​ found eating whole fruits regularly, but not drinking fruit juice, is linked to a 36 percent lower chance of getting type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p> Eating more fruits and vegetables helps keep your weight down, which helps prevent the development of type 2 diabetes, too. Fruits and vegetables are also high in fiber, which helps regulate blood sugar, per the ​BMJ​ study. Also, eating foods high in vitamin C, like fruits and vegetables keeps you from eating other foods high in added sugars, which isn't good for your blood sugar. </p>
<p> So, while research is using vitamin C as a marker, it is the type of foods that give you vitamin C that are tied to reducing your risk of type 2 diabetes, not the vitamin itself. This means popping a vitamin C supplement might not do the trick — the power is in the food itself. </p>
<p> Your Heart Health May Suffer </p>
<p> Heart disease is the number one cause of death for men and women in the United States across most racial and ethnic groups, according to the CDC. </p>
<p> There are many risk factors for heart disease that you can't change, such as age and genetics. Then there are some that can be modified — including your diet. </p>
<p> Research shows that a diet high in plant foods, such as fruits and vegetables, is associated with a reduced risk for heart disease, according to a December 2018 study in the ​International Journal of Molecular Sciences​. </p>
<p> Fruits and veggies contain special nutrients called phytochemicals, which help reduce inflammation in the body overall. </p>
<p> On the flip side, a diet high in sodium, processed foods and added sugars increases inflammation in the body. Fruits and vegetables help counter that chronic inflammation and are therefore linked to helping prevent cardiovascular disease, per the December 2018 study. </p>
<p> What's more, plant-based diets with limited animal-based foods were associated with lower overall blood pressure, per a July 2020 study in the ​Journal of Hypertension​. And high blood pressure can contribute to heart disease. </p>
<p> It May Wreak Havoc on Your Skin </p>
<p> Improving your skin tone may be as easy as adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet every day. </p>
<p> The effect of chomping down on fruit and vegetables regularly on skin health brings everything previously mentioned full circle. It's not only the environment that affects the health of your skin, but also what you put in your body. </p>
<p> So you're literally nourishing your skin from the inside out. </p>
<p> A December 2018 study in ​Nutrients​ observed a 47-percent increase in risk of developing seborrheic dermatitis — red, scaly patches on the skin — in women following a Western diet, which is typically low in fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p> Increasing the amount of fruit people ate was associated with a 25-percent decreased risk. </p>
<p> Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that's important for the formation of collagen in the skin. And getting enough vitamin C in the body may help protect the skin from ultraviolet (UV) damage, according to Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Institute. </p>
<p> Getting enough C is especially important as you get older, since aging causes a natural decline of the vitamin in your skin. </p>
<p> In addition, vitamin A and water are also actively involved in keeping the skin youthful, according to a March 2020 review in ​Nutrients​. There are many fruits and vegetables that contain both vitamins: bell peppers, cantaloupe, watermelon, oranges and kale. </p>
<p> Now, Here's How to Get More Fruits and Vegetables </p>
<p> If most people aren't getting enough fruits and vegetables, what does that mean for you? </p>
<p> The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggests that you should take in a minimum of 2 cups of fruit and 2.5 cups of vegetables each day. Fresh, frozen, dried, and canned all count for your fruit and vegetable servings. </p>
<p> If you're choosing dried fruit, keep your serving sizes to 1/4 cup. And if canned is what you like, choose low- or no-sodium for vegetables and look for fruit packed in juice, not heavy syrup. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> It can be very helpful to get guidance on your diet: Seek out a registered dietitian in your area who can take a look at what you are eating and see where you need to make some changes based on your current health status. </p>
<p> Here are a few more easy ways to get more fruit and vegetables in your diet: </p>
<p> Eat fruits and vegetables with healthy dips, such as nut butters, yogurt dips, guacamole or hummus. </p>
<p> Eat vegetarian dinners at least twice a week. </p>
<p> Add extra spinach or canned tomatoes to soups. </p>
<p> Get your day started with a fruit-and-greens smoothie (add protein powder for better satiety). </p>

<p> for. </p>

<p> Acts 15:8,9 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; … </p>
<p> (3) Let not him that eateth.--The two classes of men are exposed to two opposite faults. The strong despise the weak; the weak judge the strong. In the one case there is contempt for what is thought to be narrowness and pedantry. In the other case censorious judgments are passed on what is regarded as levity and irreligion. Human nature alters very little. </p>
<p> God hath received him.--Strictly, received him, admitted him into His Church when he was baptised, and so took him for His own. </p>

She does volunteer work regularly and has taught free public yoga classes in Santa Monica, Calif. since 2002. </p>
<p> If you have completed a medically supervised liquid diet, you will have specific guidelines about how to resume eating solid foods. This is especially true if you have any medical issues, so follow your doctor's advice. If you have designed your own liquid diet and want to get back to eating, proceed with caution. Always consult your physician or other appropriate health professional if you feel weak or ill after your liquid fast. </p>
<p> Ayurvedic Diet </p>
<p> In Ayurvedic medicine that originates from India, panchakarma is a special detoxification regimen. During that time, kitchari, which is made from well-cooked rice and mung bean, is eaten for several days. Vasant Lad, author of the "The Complete Guide to Ayurvedic Home Remedies," recommends eating this with ghee, or butter with milk fat removed. This is generally appropriate for most people ending a liquid diet. Consider eating a half-cup portion to start, two or three times a day as you are able to digest. Resist the temptation to eat heavy animal protein, fried, spicy, oily or sugary foods. These can overwhelm your digestion coming off a liquid diet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Gradual Reintroduction of Solids </p>
<p> Elson Haas, MD, has led several juicing groups in Marin County, Calif., and advised them to gradually reintroduce solid foods. Eating vegetable broth, well-cooked grains such as oatmeal, brown rice, millet, quinoa or basmati with small amounts of steamed vegetables and very small amounts of olive, flax or canola oil are usually well-tolerated, he writes in "The New Detox Diet." He also recommends small amounts of cooked legumes of all types: lentils, mung beans, navy beans and the like. These provide easy-to-digest protein if they are cooked well until very soft. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Bland Foods </p>
<p> After a liquid diet, it is generally most difficult to digest raw vegetables such as broccoli that require the stomach produce to a large amount of hydrochloric acid. Instead, consuming a bland diet such as rice congee with a small amount of cooked vegetables such as green, black or purple kale, or collard greens is generally easy to digest. Andrew Weil, MD, advises people to start with whole fruit, eat lightly, chew slowly and thoroughly and to skip eating a huge feast to avoid feeling sick. </p>

<p> Detox foods usually focus on fresh fruits and vegetables. </p>

<p> You want to revitalize your wellness, get an energy boost or maybe lose a few pounds — so you're detoxing. But what exactly are detox foods you can include on this diet? </p>
<p> No specific "detox" diet exists, but usually a simple detox consists of whole, unprocessed foods, including lots of fruits and vegetables and water. Sometimes, a detox may include plain whole grains, lean meats and raw nuts, too. Others may encourage certain supplements, herbs and teas. The point of a detox is to reduce your toxin load and lay off hard-to-digest foods to boost your overall wellness. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> Detox foods usually focus on fresh fruits and vegetables. Other unprocessed, whole foods may be included on your specific plan, depending on its focus. </p>
<p> Why Follow a Detox? </p>
<p> A detox or cleanse diet isn't really about weight loss, but that can be a happy side effect. Your body is exposed to toxins regularly. Some are made during regular metabolism and others come from the foods you eat, beverages you drink, pollutants you breathe or substances you absorb through the skin. </p>
<p> Your bodily toxins include lactic acid, urea and waste from microbes in the gut, explains the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Pesticides, processed foods, mercury in seafood, air pollution, tobacco product chemicals, drugs and alcohol are examples of external toxins. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Your personal detoxifying ability depends on genetic factors, lifestyle habits, environment and general health. If the number of toxins you take in exceeds the number you excrete, they may park in fat cells, bone and soft tissue — negatively affecting your health. </p>
<p> The intention of detox diets is to help your body move out these toxins. They aim to: </p>
<p> Improve your overall nutrient intake </p>
<p> Promote elimination of bodily waste through increased urination, sweating and defecating </p>
<p> Rest your internal organs </p>
<p> Stimulate the liver's detoxifying abilities </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism published a paper in June 2015 noting that exposure to and accumulation of toxins play a significant role in cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Your dietary intake can have a big impact on the development of chronic disease. A detox diet can help you reset your eating patterns and potentially clear out some of these detrimental toxins. </p>
<p> A naturopathic or holistic doctor may also recommend a detox diet to help determine if you have a particular food intolerance or sensitivity. Detox diets are supposed to improve your overall energy levels and sense of well-being, too. If you've been exposed to toxic chemicals or pollutants, a natural-based doctor may also recommend detoxing to clear your system. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published a review in December 2015 noting that there is no substantial clinical evidence supporting the use of detox diets, however. While a few studies do show a potential use of detox diets to enhance liver function and elimination of organic pollutants, they have small sample sizes and some design flaws. </p>
<p> If you choose to go on a detox that involves severe food restrictions or the use of supplements or that calls for enemas, talk to your doctor first and be aware of any potential health risks. </p>
<p> Detox Foods Include Leafy Greens </p>
<p> The Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism paper identified certain foods that have an influence on detoxification systems within the human body. They include leafy greens, such as watercress, broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables. </p>
<p> Leafy greens, including romaine lettuce, arugula, chicory, spinach and kale, are rich in the antioxidant beta carotene, which helps your body produce vitamin A and can lower the risk for certain diseases, explains the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. </p>
<p> Leafy greens also contain vitamins C, E and K, and some, like bok choy and mustard, are rich in many B vitamins, explains the United States Department of Agriculture. Antioxidants present in the greens protect cells and may help deter the development of cancer. The greens are perfect for a detox because they also have lots of fiber — to keep things moving in the digestive tract —and lots of iron, magnesium, potassium and calcium. Greens are light and don't weigh you down with lots of extra calories or fat. </p>
<p> Other Vegetables Help Detox Too </p>
<p> The Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism paper also noted that allium vegetables, which includes garlic, onions, scallions, chives and leeks, have detoxifying effects. This is due to the presence of a compound known as astaxanthin. This carotenoid has the potential to prevent diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, explains a paper published in a January 2014 issue of Marine Drugs. </p>
<p> Apiaceous vegetables, such as carrots, celery and parsley, offer value on a detoxification diet, too, due to the presence of caffeic acid. Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition published a paper in October 2016 noting that caffeic acid has antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and antiviral effects. </p>
<p> Additional Foods to Include </p>
<p> As noted in the Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism paper, detox foods really can encompass a whole range of foods rich in compounds such as resveratrol, fish oil, quercetin and lycopene. </p>
<p> Resveratrol is found in foods such as peanuts, grapes and some berries. It's also found in red wine, but alcohol is usually off-limits on a detox. Fish oil is most abundant in fatty fish, especially salmon and mackerel. If you include fish on a cleanse, make sure it's wild caught and not farmed. </p>
<p> Nutrients published a paper in March 2016 stating that quercetin can be obtained from eating many fruits and vegetables — all appropriate for a detox — such as apples, berries, grapes and tomatoes, as well as many seeds and nuts. </p>
<p> Lycopene is abundant in red-hued fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, guava, watermelon, papaya and red grapefruit explains Frontiers in Pharmacology, published in May 2018. Lycopene's detoxifying benefits include anti-inflammatory properties. </p>
<p> Don’t Make It Complicated </p>
<p> A detox doesn't have to be comprised of a complex combination of foods and supplements. As explained by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, your body truly is a powerful detoxifier and uses nutrients consumed from a variety of whole, natural foods to remove toxins from the body. </p>
<p> A simple detox that promotes toxin elimination and good health includes lots of fruits and vegetables — five to nine servings per day says the organization. A serving of vegetables is 2 cups, and a serving of fruit is 1.5 cups. Cruciferous vegetables like Brussels sprouts, artichokes and leeks are good. Fruits such as berries are also a super choice. </p>
<p> The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics also recommends you: </p>
<p> Keep yourself hydrated with clean water or unsweetened green tea. </p>
<p> Eat lots of fiber from vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains. </p>
<p> Consume lean protein, such as plain chicken breast, which is important to your body's levels of glutathione, a natural detoxifying enzyme. </p>
<p> Add naturally fermented foods such as plain yogurt, kimchi and kefir to your diet. The probiotics in these foods promote a healthy gut. </p>
<p> Also, you might consider taking a comprehensive vitamin-mineral supplement to fill in any nutrient gaps. Talk to your doctor or nutritionist for recommendations about the best brands and types to choose. </p>

<p> We've all been told that fruit is good for us so it makes sense that more fruit would be even better, right? But what if that was all we ate? Would it make you a healthier person? This is your body on only eating fruit for one year. Believe it or not, eating only fruit is a thing. It's known as the fruitarian diet. Apple Steve Jobs was a fruitarian. He believed eating a diet primarily composed of fruit would cleanse his body of harmful fluids. Was he right? Or would eating only fruit send you to the doctor? Most fruit only diets are actually mostly fruit diets as they usually include some nuts, seeds, and vegetables but for this challenge, we're going full on only fruit. So, let's get started. The new diet starts well. You enjoy all kinds of fruit so there's no problem finding variety but you should be careful with your choices. A lot of fruit is very high in sugar so you may want to limit the amount of lychee, mango, cherries, and grapes you eat. Bananas are also very high in sugar but they're a good source of potassium so enjoy them in moderation. Blueberries are high in fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins C and K making them an excellent choice. Watermelon will keep you hydrated and provide a wide variety of nutrients and apples will give you much needed fiber and antioxidants. As much as you enjoy the fruit you've been eating, you've started to crave other things, particularly high-carb foods like bread, potatoes, and pasta. And you've noticed your visits to the restroom have become much more frequent as all that fiber works its way through your body. Halfway through the year and although you've become used to your new diet, those cravings are getting worse. You find that you're getting tired quickly and are often lightheaded and dizzy. You're malnourished and you aren't getting the nutrients you need. To combat this, you need to supplement your diet with vitamins and protein powders. Be sure to drink lots of water to keep hydrated. It will also help digest all that sugar. Chances are that by this point, you've had to deal with some adverse health effects. If not, consider self lucky but be ready. They're coming soon. Your digestive system is a mess. All that fiber is wreaking havoc with your innards. You feel bloated and have cramps. You often feel sick and tired as your blood sugar levels are out of whack and you've lost a lot of weight which may have been your goal in the first place. However, it's not just fat you're losing, you're not getting the nutrients you need to maintain your muscles. All this fruit is over working your pancreas so it's beginning to fail. Although there's no follow a fruitarian diet typically follow diets that are no more than 90% fruit. Although it doesn't seem like much, that 10% of veggies and carbs makes all the difference. Moderation and balance are key. Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help reduce the risk of many leading causes of illness. Including heart disease, diabetes and some cancers but it's also important not to ignore the other food groups. Now that you've survived 12 months of only fruit, you're probably looking forward to enjoying something other than an apple. Well, we've got what you need. How about Mountain Dew? That's it. You can only drink Mountain Dew. That's your next challenge. On another episode of Your Body On. </p>

<p> Safe Food to Eat During the Master Cleanse </p>

<p> Medically Reviewed by Jill Corleone, RDN, LD </p>
<p> ABOUT THE REVIEWER </p>

<p> Jill Corleone is a registered dietitian with more than 20 years of experience. She graduated with honors from New York University and completed her clinical internship at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. </p>

<p> Technically, you aren't supposed to eat at all during the core fasting portion of the Master Cleanse diet. However, the creator of the diet issued a set of guidelines for careful eating to help you "ease in" to the fasting stretch and then "ease out" at the end. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> If you are determined to do the Master Cleanse or any other "juice detox diet," speak to a physician first about which diet will be best for your body. </p>
<p> Beware of Extreme Cleanses </p>
<p> Before going into the details of the Master Cleanse, here's a word from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health about so-called detox and cleanse programs. They note that there's a very limited body of scientific research about such programs, and that even in studies that show positive results for factors like weight or insulin resistance, they're often of low quality or have not been peer-reviewed to ensure quality. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In particular, they cite a review of evidence published in the December 2015 issue of the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, in which researchers concluded there is no compelling evidence to support the use of detox diets for weight management or eliminating toxins from the body. </p>
<p> They also cite another evidence review, this one published in a November 2017 issue of Current Gastroenterology Reports, in which researchers conclude that while the very low calorie intake of a juice diet can lead to initial weight loss, the weight tends to come back on once you resume your normal diet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Is the Master Cleanse Effective? </p>
<p> Only one small study has ever addressed the Master Cleanse directly. It was published in the May 2015 issue of Nutrition Research, and involved a group of 84 women. Of the test subjects, those who used the lemon detox diet and those who took a placebo juice diet showed significantly better changes in body weight and body fat than the control group. </p>
<p> Other markers, including changes in serum insulin levels and C-reactive protein, seem to indicate positive results for the lemon diet group. However, the placebo group showed some of the same beneficial effects and, as already noted, the study doesn't address what happened after the subjects stopped the juice diet. It also doesn't address possible contraindications or adverse reactions for this sort of diet. </p>
<p> Eating on the Master Cleanse </p>
<p> If you're going to do the Master Cleanse anyway, what can you eat? As explained in the Master Cleanse — an online magazine dedicated to this juice detox diet — you're not supposed to eat solid foods at all during the lemonade fasting portion of this diet, which typically lasts 10 days. However, you do have the choice to ease in to your upcoming fast by eating progressively lighter foods for a three-day "ease in" period. This is optional. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As noted in the Master Cleanse magazine, the lemonade you'll drink during the 10-day fasting period consists of the following, mixed into every 8 ounces of water: </p>
<p> 2 tablespoons lemon juice </p>
<p> 2 tablespoons maple syrup </p>
<p> 1/16 teaspoon cayenne pepper </p>
<p> As an intrepid writer who tried the Master Cleanse lemon diet notes, the diet's creator, Stanley Burroughs, claims that this homemade drink provides all the essential nutrients your body needs. He also recommends taking a laxative tea or "saltwater flush" during the fast to keep your bowels moving. </p>
<p> Once you're done fasting, you undergo a three-day "ease out" period, in which you slowly reintroduce solid foods. This phase comes with clearer guidelines for what you can eat — perhaps because as even the cheery Master Cleanse online magazine notes, carelessly reintroducing solid foods after a fast poses a risk of serious complications, including "serious constipation or worse." </p>
<p> They recommend introducing 2 liters of orange juice mixed with water and maple syrup (optional, for extra calories) on your first "ease out" day, then fruit and vegetable juice or broth on the next day. On day three, include solid fruits and veggies, and on day four go back to your regular diet — although they advocate continuing to eat "live" foods. </p>
<p> Examples of gentle foods they recommend to ease you out of your fast include hummus, salads, homemade vegetable soups (no meat or dairy) and fresh, homemade juices and smoothies. </p>

<p> You may have heard one of your friends say they're a pescatarian, and you may have wondered what on earth that means. By definition, a pescatarian is a person who eats seafood but not other types of meat. </p>
<p> But just as each person is different, what they choose to eat can vary. If you're hosting a dinner party for a pescatarian, it's best to clarify with them what they eat and don't eat. If you're considering becoming a pescatarian yourself, you can use the four types of foods outlined below to guide you. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What Is a Pescatarian? </p>
<p> Pescatarians are similar to vegetarians, but the difference is that pescatarians eat fish and shellfish in addition to an otherwise vegetarian diet. Like vegetarians, most pescatarians include eggs and dairy in their diets, according to registered dietitian Judith C. Thalheimer in Today's Dietitian. </p>
<p> Major vegetarian organizations, including the Vegetarian Society, do not recognize pescatarians as true vegetarians. But pescatarians believe that they can improve their health, the plight of land animals and the condition of our planet by refusing to consume meats other than seafood. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> While you can eat an unhealthy diet as a pescatarian, most pescatarians and vegetarians consume less total fat, less cholesterol and less saturated fat than people who eat meat regularly. </p>
<p> According to the UK's National Health Service, most people should include more seafood in their diet because fish and shellfish are rich in nutrients, and oily fish like like salmon are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. </p>
<p> Pescatarians can eat mollusks like mussels. </p>

<p> 1. Seafood for Pescatarians </p>
<p> Pescatarians do not eat land animals and birds, including beef, pork, chicken and other types of poultry. They do, however, eat fish, including: </p>
<p> These foods can be prepared in any manner, as long as they are not prepared with other ingredients that contain meat from land animals. </p>
<p> 2. Plant Foods for Pescatarians </p>
<p> Fruits, vegetables and plant-based proteins are often the main course for pescatarians, much like vegetarians and vegans. Depending on personal preferences and food allergies or sensitivities, they can eat any or all of the following: </p>
<p> Beans </p>
<p> Some pescatarians rely on beans, nuts and dairy for the majority of their protein, eating fish and seafood only on occasion. </p>
<p> Not all pescatarians eat eggs and dairy but some do. </p>

<p> 3. Eggs and Dairy for Pescatarians </p>
<p> Whether or not to consume eggs and dairy is a personal choice that each pescatarian makes based on his own preferences and values. Some of these products pescatarians may or may not eat include: </p>
<p> 4. Carbohydrates for Pescatarians </p>
<p> Carbohydrates are a staple of most pescatarian diets. Fruits, vegetables, beans and grains are rich sources of carbohydrates not found in meat and fish. These foods are excellent sources of not only carbohydrates for energy, but also vitamins, minerals and fiber. </p>
<p> Good sources of carbohydrates in a pescatarian diet include: </p>
<p> Whole wheat bread and pasta </p>
<p> The pitfall of some vegetarians and pescatarians is eating too many refined and processed carbohydrate foods. These foods are typically low in nutrients and high in fat and sugar. </p>
<p> Unhealthy carbohydrate foods pescatarians should avoid or limit include: </p>
<p> Refined white bread and pasta </p>
<p> White rice </p>
<p> Pastries, cookies and cakes </p>
<p> Disadvantages of a Pescatarian Diet </p>
<p> Fish and shellfish are good sources of protein and healthy fats, but eating too much increases your exposure to pollutants and mercury. Depending on the waters that are being fished, some of those pollutants can include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin and perflourooctane sulfonate (PFO). </p>
<p> Excessive exposure to these pollutants on a pescatarian diet could potentially increase the risk of cancer, diabetes and thyroid disease. The risks of exposure are higher in pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children. </p>
<p> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides a list of fish and shellfish that are safest to eat. Some of the best choices are: </p>
<p> The FDA and EPA caution pregnant women and women who may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children to not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish because of the high levels of mercury those fish contain. </p>
<p> If you consume very minimal amounts of fish or animal products, be certain to choose vitamin B-12 fortified foods, like breakfast cereal or soy milk, to make up for a potential deficit, or ask your health care provider to recommend a supplement. </p>
<p> You can try a health vegetarian salad with chickpeas as part of a pescatarian diet. </p>

<p> How do you prevent sweating after eating? </p>
<p> Gustatory sweating is sweating that occurs on the forehead, scalp, neck, and upper lip while eating, talking, or thinking about food. </p>
<p> For many people, sweating occurs due to eating hot and spicy food. For others, however, it happens frequently after eating any food. </p>
<p> In these cases where eating any food causes sweating, it is most likely due to nerve damage in or around the parotid gland, the gland in the cheek that produces saliva. When this occurs, it tends to happen on one side of the face and is known as Frey’s syndrome. </p>
<p> In some rare cases, people with diabetes mellitus may experience bilateral gustatory sweating, with sweating on both sides of the face. </p>
<p> In this article, we compare gustatory sweating with regular sweating and look at what can be done to treat or prevent cases of gustatory sweating. </p>
<p> Gustatory sweating is similar to Frey’s syndrome, and the two terms are often used interchangeably. </p>
<p> It is not uncommon for people to sweat during or after eating. For most people, sweating occurs on the face, scalp, or neck when they are eating spicy or hot foods and drinks. </p>
<p> In these cases, the person’s body is responding naturally to stimulation of a rise in body temperature through sweat. This is a normal reaction and not a cause for concern. </p>
<p> A person with Frey’s syndrome has a problem with their parotid gland and may start to sweat and flush on the scalp, face, ears, and neck after eating any food. However, foods that make people produce a lot of saliva are most likely to trigger the reaction. </p>
<p> Typically, a person develops Frey’s syndrome as a result of surgery near the parotid gland. However, other people may experience Frey’s syndrome due to another injury or illness that affects the parotid gland. </p>
<p> In an attempt to heal themselves, damaged nerves sometimes get mixed up with other nerves, causing a person to produce sweat instead of saliva. </p>
<p> Typically, Frey’s syndrome occurs on just one side of the face. Although both cheeks have a parotid gland, only one may have been damaged. </p>
<p> Gustatory sweating can occur for no apparent reason or as a result of an underlying condition, such as diabetes or Parkinson’s disease. These diseases can also cause damage to the nerves in the mouth. When the nerves become injured, they can become confused and cause sweating. </p>
<p> Unlike Frey’s syndrome, other types of gustatory sweating often occur on both sides of the face. Unlike regular sweating due to eating spicy or hot foods, gustatory sweating causes a person to sweat and flush after eating, thinking, or even talking about food. </p>
<p> This sweating and flushing may occur around the temples, cheeks, neck, forehead, chest, or lips. </p>
<p> Gustatory sweating may cause some people distress, as thinking about food can trigger the reactions of sweating. Since there is often an underlying cause, a person should talk to their doctor to find out what may be causing the sweating. </p>
<p> Frey’s syndrome is triggered by eating food, but it can also occur even while thinking or talking about food. It develops on one side of the face in the area of the affected parotid gland. </p>
<p> Gustatory sweating is often the result of an underlying condition. Some of the more common conditions that may cause gustatory sweating include: </p>
<p> diabetes melliltus </p>
<p> a viral infection affecting the face, such as Bell’s palsy or shingles </p>
<p> People do not necessarily need to see a doctor after sweating from eating food. Those who only sweat while eating either very hot or spicy foods have no reason to be concerned. </p>
<p> Some people who experience Frey’s syndrome may consider it to be a nuisance but do not consider it significant enough to seek help. </p>
<p> However, those people who sweat profusely after tasting, smelling, or talking about food may wish to see a doctor. A doctor can diagnose Frey’s syndrome or another type of gustatory sweating by: </p>
<p> noting the characteristic symptoms </p>
<p> taking a medical history </p>
<p> carrying out the minor iodine-starch test </p>
<p> The minor iodine-starch test involves swabbing the area of the body where the sweating occurs with an iodine solution. The doctor will then apply a starch, such as corn starch, over the iodine. </p>
<p> When the starch and iodine are in place, the doctor will stimulate the mouth, often with an acidic food. A person with Frey’s syndrome or other gustatory sweating will show a discoloration where the sweat forms. </p>
<p> Once diagnosed, a doctor can help a person identify the underlying cause. In some cases, it may be due to surgery or another known condition that the person has. In others, the doctor may wish to carry out further testing to find out what might be causing the problem. </p>
<p> Knowing the cause helps the doctor know how to treat the sweating. </p>
<p> Treatment for gustatory sweating depends on what is causing it. </p>
<p> A doctor treating Frey’s syndrome typically focuses on the symptoms. There is often little that can be done to fix the damaged nerves. Surgical procedures are available to replace affected skin, but they are risky and not often advised. </p>
<p> A doctor may prescribe medicines and topical creams that help block undesired activities of the nervous system, such as sweating. </p>
<p> One medication that has proved quite successful to treat sweating associated with Frey’s syndrome, however, is botulinum toxin type A (Botox). The medication is injected into the affected area to stop the sweating, and there are minimal side effects. </p>
<p> One disadvantage of botulinum toxin is that the effects are temporary. Research shows that people tend to need repeat injections after 9–12 months. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not currently approve the use of Botox for treating gustatory sweating, however. </p>
<p> Treating gustatory sweating when it is not the result of injury or surgery often requires treating the underlying disease or disorder if it is known. </p>
<p> People who suspect that their gustatory sweating is a result of an underlying condition should speak to their doctor about any other symptoms they experience. </p>
<p> Gustatory sweating is considered to be a harmless condition. Some people find that they can deal with the symptoms with no need for medical intervention. </p>
<p> Where the sweating is profuse and a cause for embarrassment, people may want to treat their symptoms. </p>
<p> It is also important that people seek medical attention if profuse sweating is unexplainable, as it could indicate an underlying condition. </p>

<p> Why do I cough after I eat? </p>
<p> It is not uncommon to cough after eating. Coughing is a typical reaction of the body trying to clear irritants from the airways. Irritants are sometimes introduced into the body when eating, and this can lead to coughing. </p>
<p> If coughing after eating happens frequently, people should consult a doctor to determine a cause. Once the cause is known, a person can make some lifestyle changes or take medications to treat it. </p>
<p> Some of the most common causes include the following: </p>
<p> There are many potential causes of coughing after eating: </p>
<p> Food allergies </p>
<p> Allergies are a common cause of coughing after eating. They can develop at any age but typically develop during childhood. </p>
<p> When someone has a food allergy, their body’s immune system is overreacting to what it believes is a harmful substance. People may also experience: </p>
<p> People can have an allergy to one or more foods. If a person coughs because of a food allergy, it is essential that they find out what foods trigger the coughing. </p>
<p> A doctor can help pinpoint the foods causing the reaction. </p>
<p> Asthma </p>
<p> Asthma affects the airways and develops after exposure to an irritant, which can include food. </p>
<p> Sulfite is a common additive found in many drinks and food that often cause asthma symptoms. Foods that contain sulfites and should be avoided include: </p>
<p> However, any food that causes a person to experience an allergic reaction may trigger an asthma attack as well. </p>
<p> In addition to coughing, a person may experience: </p>
<p> wheezing </p>
<p> tightness in the chest </p>
<p> trouble breathing </p>
<p> Dysphagia </p>
<p> Dysphagia causes difficulty when swallowing. When dysphagia occurs, a person’s body has great difficulty moving food and drink from the mouth to the stomach. It can result in pain or discomfort. </p>
<p> Dysphagia may make a person feel as if food has become lodged in the throat. This feeling can lead to gagging or coughing after eating as the body tries to clear the perceived blockage from the throat. </p>
<p> Conditions such as acid reflux often cause dysphagia. A doctor can determine the underlying cause. </p>
<p> Acid reflux </p>
<p> Acid reflux occurs when acid from the stomach travels up the food pipe. The acid may make its way into the upper food pipe or throat through the opening of the stomach, known as the lower esophageal sphincter. </p>
<p> When a person is eating, the sphincter relaxes to allow food to travel to the stomach. In some cases, the sphincter does not close entirely. The resulting gap allows acid from the stomach to travel upward. </p>
<p> The acid can irritate the food pipe, causing coughing. People may also experience: </p>
<p> GERD is a chronic condition that causes a more severe form of acid reflux. When someone has GERD, they are very likely going to experience a cough as well as: </p>
<p> wheezing </p>
<p> nausea vomiting </p>
<p> reflux occurring two or more times a week </p>
<p> LPR does not have the same symptoms of GERD. When it occurs, stomach acid may travel as far up as the nasal passages. Similarly to GERD, it can cause coughing as well as: </p>
<p> post nasal drip </p>
<p> hoarseness </p>
<p> need to clear throat </p>
<p> A doctor can treat these two conditions with medications. A person can also control these conditions with diet modifications. However, there is no cure for them. </p>
<p> Aspiration pneumonia </p>
<p> It is possible to inhale small particles of liquid or food when eating. In healthy people, the lungs will expel these particles through coughing. </p>
<p> Sometimes, the lungs may not be healthy enough to remove the tiny particles. When this occurs, bacteria from the food may become trapped in the lungs, resulting in aspiration pneumonia. </p>
<p> People are at an increased risk for developing aspiration pneumonia if they have acid reflux or trouble swallowing. </p>
<p> When someone experiences these symptoms, it is essential they speak to a doctor. Aspiration pneumonia can cause serious medical problems, such as respiratory failure or lung abscess. </p>
<p> Infections </p>
<p> People might experience a cough caused by an infection in the upper respiratory system. If a cough does not clear up properly, it can lead to a person coughing immediately following eating or drinking. </p>
<p> This type of cough is difficult to treat as it irritates the throat, causing the person to cough more and preventing healing. </p>
<p> It is possible to develop an infection in the food pipe or larynx. This type of infection may be caused by a virus, fungus, or bacteria. The throat may become inflamed and irritated when infected. The inflammation causes a person to cough, particularly following meals. </p>
<p> Not everyone who experiences a cough after eating will need to see a doctor. However, it is a good idea to see a doctor for a post-eating cough when: </p>
<p> it occurs frequently </p>
<p> it lasts longer than 2 weeks </p>
<p> the reason for the cough is unknown </p>
<p> there is blood in the mucus </p>
<p> the person experiencing the cough is an active smoker </p>
<p> Treatment will vary based on the cause. Treatment may be as simple as avoiding trigger foods or treating the condition with medications. </p>
<p> Treatment often focuses on prevention. Steps to prevent coughing following eating or drinking include: </p>
<p> slow down when eating </p>
<p> drink more water during meals </p>
<p> track foods to help determine which cause coughing </p>
<p> People can often avoid coughing following eating with some simple prevention strategies. </p>
<p> Avoiding foods that trigger coughing is often a good first step. However, people should remain aware of changes in their cough, other symptoms, and how frequent and long the cough is lasting. </p>
<p> People should see a doctor if they have any concerns or doubts. </p>

<p> Why do I get a pain in my back after eating? </p>
<p> Back pain after eating is often the result of referred pain. This is pain that originates in one area of the body and radiates to another. Several problems can cause back pain after eating, ranging from poor posture to ulcers. </p>
<p> Read on to learn more about back pain after eating and a variety of treatments. </p>
<p> The following issues can lead to back pain after eating: </p>
<p> 1. Allergies and intolerances </p>
<p> People with allergies or intolerances to certain foods may experience inflammation after eating them. If they already have back pain, the inflammation can make symptoms worse. </p>
<p> Examples of foods that may trigger inflammation and back pain include: </p>
<p> dairy </p>
<p> gluten </p>
<p> peanuts </p>
<p> Some foods can aggravate underlying conditions, resulting in back pain. For example, very spicy foods can cause heartburn, making back pain worse. </p>
<p> 2. Gallbladder inflammation and gallstones </p>
<p> The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that sits below the liver. It stores and releases bile, a fluid that helps the body to digest fats. </p>
<p> The gallbladder can become inflamed, especially if hard deposits known as gallstones are present. Eating fatty foods can trigger a gallbladder attack, in which the organ becomes inflamed and causes pain. </p>
<p> Typical symptoms of a gallbladder attack include nausea and severe pain in the upper abdomen. This pain may radiate to the back. </p>
<p> 3. Heart attack </p>
<p> Back pain can signal a heart attack, especially if accompanied by symptoms such as: </p>
<p> lightheadedness </p>
<p> nausea </p>
<p> pain in the arm, jaw, or neck </p>
<p> According to the American Heart Association, women are more likely than men to experience atypical heart attack symptoms. These may include: </p>
<p> pressure in the upper back </p>
<p> dizziness </p>
<p> pain in the abdomen </p>
<p> It should be noted that women do not always have chest pain when experiencing heart problems. </p>
<p> 4. Heartburn </p>
<p> Back pain after eating may result from heartburn, a digestive condition characterized by burning pain in the chest. It is estimated that over 15 million Americans experience heartburn every day. </p>
<p> Other symptoms may include a sour taste in the mouth, a sore throat, and a cough. Certain foods may trigger heartburn symptoms, including: </p>
<p> caffeine </p>
<p> chocolate </p>
<p> spicy foods </p>
<p> Experiencing heartburn more than twice a week may indicate gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can lead to ulcers if not properly managed. </p>
<p> 5. Kidney infection </p>
<p> Symptoms are typically present throughout the day, though some people may notice them more after eating. Anyone who suspects that they have a kidney infection should seek medical attention to prevent complications. </p>
<p> 6. Pancreatitis </p>
<p> The pancreas is an organ that participates in digestion and blood sugar regulation. Inflammmation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis. Symptoms include: </p>
<p> Authors of a 2013 study report that approximately 70 percent of pancreatitis cases are caused by long-term, heavy alcohol consumption. </p>
<p> 7. Poor posture </p>
<p> Bad posture is a common cause of back pain. A person who is hunched over during meals may experience this pain after eating. </p>
<p> Poor posture while sitting, standing, or working at a desk can also lead to back pain at any time of the day. </p>
<p> 8. Ulcer </p>
<p> An ulcer in the stomach or esophagus may lead to pain that radiates to the back. Other ulcer symptoms include: </p>
<p> feeling full after eating </p>
<p> Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) often causes ulcers. They may also be caused by long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). </p>
<p> Spicy or acidic foods can make ulcer symptoms worse. </p>
<p> Treatment for back pain after eating depends on the underlying cause. Common treatments are listed below. </p>
<p> Dietary changes </p>
<p> If back pain results from heartburn, ulcers, or food intolerances, it may be helpful to remove trigger foods from the diet. </p>
<p> Trigger foods vary from person to person, but common culprits include: </p>
<p> To identify trigger foods, it may be helpful to keep a food diary or work with a dietitian. </p>
<p> Medications </p>
<p> Medications used to treat back pain after eating will vary significantly, depending on the problem. For example: </p>
<p> Antibiotics can treat kidney infections and H. pylori infections. </p>
<p> Pain relievers may control symptoms of pancreatitis and gallbladder inflammation, when these cases are mild. </p>
<p> Proton pump inhibitors and acid blockers can help to treat heartburn, GERD, and ulcers. </p>
<p> Physical therapy and exercise </p>
<p> Physical therapists are able to correct poor posture. They may recommend stretches and exercises to help strengthen the core muscles and support the back and spine. </p>
<p> Exercises practiced in yoga, Pilates, and tai chi may be particularly beneficial. </p>
<p> Other treatment </p>
<p> If a doctor cannot identify the cause of back pain after eating, try common remedies for generalized back pain. These include resting, applying ice and taking pain relievers. </p>
<p> Here are some tips to prevent back pain after eating: </p>
<p> exercising regularly, to keep muscles strong and prevent poor posture </p>
<p> sitting up straight when eating or sitting at a desk, and use lower back support if necessary </p>
<p> avoiding foods that trigger heartburn and intolerances </p>
<p> reducing stress to avoid irritating ulcers and contributing to muscular tension </p>
<p> limiting alcohol consumption </p>
<p> avoiding fatty, spicy, or sugary foods </p>
<p> addressing underlying medical conditions and infections without delay </p>
<p> Anyone with persistent or worsening back pain should speak to a doctor. </p>
<p> Seek prompt medical treatment if the pain is accompanied by symptoms such as: </p>
<p> burning pain while urinating, or other urinary symptoms </p>
<p> black or tarry stools, which suggest an ulcer </p>
<p> Contact emergency services if back pain is accompanied by any of the following symptoms of a cardiac event: </p>
<p> Back pain after eating is usually the result of referred pain from another area of the body, and it is not always a cause for concern. </p>
<p> However, if the pain persists or is accompanied by other symptoms, it is important to see a doctor. </p>
<p> Most causes of back pain after eating can be easily treated with medication, lifestyle changes, and dietary modifications. </p>

<p> Why do I feel sick after I eat? </p>
<p> We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process. </p>
<p> Stomach pain or discomfort after eating has many causes. If stomach pain happens after eating and then goes away, it is usually caused by food. </p>
<p> If a person has other symptoms or ongoing discomfort despite making changes to their diet, it may be a medical condition. </p>
<p> Stomach pain can be prevented by an individual eating a balanced, healthful diet with fresh fruits and vegetables. Not eating spicy or fatty foods and cutting down on sugary drinks or caffeine, may also help. </p>
<p> In this article, we list 21 reasons why a person’s stomach may hurt or feel uncomfortable after they eat, including food and medical causes. </p>
<p> For many different reasons, the food that a person chooses to eat may lead to their stomach hurting afterward. </p>
<p> 1. Food poisoning </p>
<p> One of the key symptoms of food poisoning is stomach pain. Other symptoms include: </p>
<p> Symptoms can appear a few hours after eating, but they may take days or weeks to surface. </p>
<p> Food poisoning normally only lasts a few days. It can usually be treated at home with rest and fluids. </p>
<p> 2. Acidic foods </p>
<p> Acidic foods that can irritate the stomach include fruit juices, processed cheese, and tomatoes. </p>
<p> Finding alternatives, such as replacing fruit juices with water or tea, may help to cut down on stomach pain. </p>
<p> 3. Trapped wind </p>
<p> Trapped wind in the digestive tract can cause discomfort. The stomach may feel stretched and uncomfortable, or there may be a sharp pain. </p>
<p> Sugary drinks and certain foods can cause bloating and wind. These include: </p>
<p> When someone chews gum, sucks sweets, or eats with their mouth open, it can lead to them swallowing air. This can be another cause of wind. </p>
<p> 4. Spicy foods </p>
<p> Chili peppers are often used to flavor spicy food. They contain capsaicin, a chemical that causes the hot or burning sensation. Capsaicin may irritate sensitive parts of the body, including the stomach. </p>
<p> 5. Indigestion </p>
<p> A person can suffer indigestion after eating or drinking. As well as stomach ache, they may feel bloated or sick. </p>
<p> The stomach contains acid to break down food. Sometimes, this can irritate the stomach lining and cause indigestion. </p>
<p> Rich or fatty foods, caffeine, sugary drinks, and alcohol can make indigestion worse. </p>
<p> Over-the-counter medication, which is available online and known as an antacid, may help if cutting out certain foods and drinks makes no difference. </p>
<p> 6. Caffeine </p>
<p> Caffeine is a stimulant found in tea and coffee. It can irritate the stomach and cause discomfort for some people. </p>
<p> People can choose alternatives and still enjoy hot drinks. Decaffeinated tea and decaffeinated coffee are available online. Fruit teas or hot water with a slice of lemon are also healthful to help people stay hydrated during the day. </p>
<p> 7. Alcohol </p>
<p> Alcoholic drinks can cause bloating. This is especially true if they are carbonated, such as beer or sparkling wine. They may also make heartburn worse. </p>
<p> If someone cuts down on the amount of alcohol they drink, it can have many health benefits. Drinking a soft drink or water between alcoholic ones or choosing alcohol-free wine or beer are ways to reduce alcohol consumption. </p>
<p> 8. Food allergy or intolerance </p>
<p> Some people may be allergic to certain foods. These can irritate the stomach and may cause pain after eating. </p>
<p> An intolerance is a milder form of an allergy. Both allergies and intolerances can be caused by many different foods. </p>
<p> Common intolerances include gluten, wheat, and lactose. </p>
<p> People can keep a food diary if they think they might have an allergy. </p>
<p> A food diary is a written record of what they have consumed at each meal, including drinks and snacks. They should also include a note of when their stomach hurts. </p>
<p> Keeping a diary can help determine the foods causing an issue. People can then cut this food out of their diet. </p>
<p> 9. Eating too much </p>
<p> Overfilling the stomach on a regular basis is not good for health. Discomfort after eating may be a sign that a person is eating too much. </p>
<p> Here, we give some of the medical conditions that can also make someone’s stomach hurt after eating. </p>
<p> 10. Gastritis </p>
<p> Gastritis causes the lining of the stomach to become inflamed. It can cause stomach pain, sickness, vomiting, and indigestion. </p>
<p> Mild gastritis can be treated at home with medication and changes to diet. Cutting out acidic foods and eating smaller meals throughout the day can help. </p>
<p> 11. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) </p>
<p> IBD causes the gut to become inflamed. IBD can lead to a range of symptoms, with one being stomach pain. </p>
<p> IBD is a long-term condition that requires treatment with medication and lifestyle changes. </p>
<p> 12. Stomach ulcer </p>
<p> A stomach ulcer is a sore that develops on the stomach lining. It will cause a burning pain in the middle of the stomach. </p>
<p> Stomach ulcers are often caused by an infection. They can also be the result of medications that include aspirin if it is frequently taken over a long period. Treatment is with acid-suppressing medication, with or without antibiotics. </p>
<p> 13. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) </p>
<p> IBS is a condition affecting the digestive system. As well as constipation and diarrhea, it can cause stomach cramps and bloating. </p>
<p> Symptoms can last for days, weeks, or months, and may not always happen after eating. </p>
<p> Although there is no cure, lifestyle changes can help. These include: </p>
<p> eating slowly </p>
<p> avoiding fatty and processed foods </p>
<p> getting plenty of exercise </p>
<p> cutting out alcohol and sugary drinks </p>
<p> eating meals at regular times and not skipping meals </p>
<p> 14. Gallstones </p>
<p> Gallstones are hard pieces of material that form in the gallbladder. If they block a bile duct, they can cause sharp, sudden pain. </p>
<p> Treatment is with medication or surgery, depending on the severity of the condition. </p>
<p> 15. Heartburn </p>
<p> Heartburn is known as gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in medical terms. It can also be called acid reflux. </p>
<p> GER is caused by acid coming up from the stomach into the food pipe. It feels like a burning sensation in the chest and throat. It can also cause a burning feeling in the stomach. </p>
<p> Eliminating alcohol, spicy foods, and losing weight if needed can help control heartburn. </p>
<p> 16. Overactive thyroid </p>
<p> The thyroid gland produces hormones that tell the body how to work. An overactive thyroid can cause medical problems that may affect the bones, muscles, and heart. </p>
<p> One symptom of an overactive thyroid is stomach pain and diarrhea. Other symptoms include trouble sleeping, weight loss, and a rapid heartbeat. </p>
<p> 17. Celiac disease </p>
<p> Celiac disease is a disorder of the digestive system. It is caused by an allergy to gluten, found in rye, barley, and wheat. </p>
<p> Symptoms include stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea and bloating. Cutting gluten out of the diet can stop the effects of the condition. </p>
<p> Lastly, there are several other lifestyle and health reasons why someone’s stomach can hurt after eating. </p>
<p> 18. Stress </p>
<p> Stress can cause muscles to become tense, which can create pain or discomfort in the stomach. </p>
<p> A few slow, deep breaths before eating can relax the muscles. Eating slowly and calmly can help to avoid stomach pain. </p>
<p> 19. Being overweight </p>
<p> Being overweight can mean that a person is more likely to develop conditions such as heartburn or a stomach ulcer. </p>
<p> When an individual loses some excess weight, it can help avoid their stomach hurting after eating. </p>
<p> 20. Constipation </p>
<p> Not having enough bowel movements or having stool that is hard and difficult to pass is likely to be caused by constipation. Stomach pain and bloating are other common symptoms of constipation. </p>
<p> People can treat constipation by eating a diet that is high in fiber and drinking plenty of fluids. </p>
<p> 21. Blood pressure medication </p>
<p> Medication used to treat blood pressure can cause side effects. These include constipation and sometimes stomach pain. </p>
<p> If a person experiences side effects from this medication, they can speak to their doctor about switching to an alternative type. </p>
<p> If someone has any symptoms of the medical conditions listed here, they should seek medical advice. </p>
<p> If stomach pain after eating continues for a long time, and lifestyle and diet changes do not work, people are advised to see a doctor. </p>

<p> What is a pescatarian diet? </p>
<p> In the pescatarian diet, a person’s main source of animal protein comes from fish and other seafood, such as shrimp. </p>
<p> Eating a diet consisting mainly of plant-based foods has a variety of health benefits, which the addition of fish and fish products may enhance. </p>
<p> However, some types of fish may absorb mercury from their environment, so certain people may need to limit their intake. </p>
<p> In this article, we look at the potential health benefits of a pescatarian diet and what people can eat on this kind of diet. </p>
<p> The pescatarian diet has many health benefits. Below, we cover some of these benefits. </p>
<p> Heart health </p>
<p> Eating fish, especially fatty fish, provides increased long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake. An omega-3 fatty acid is an unsaturated fat that can be beneficial to people, and some omega-3s are integral for healthy living. </p>
<p> People who eat fish have lower blood pressure, a lower risk of abnormal heart rhythms, and fewer fatal heart attacks than those who do not include fish in their diet. </p>
<p> Apart from fish, the pescatarian diet consists mainly of plant foods. According to one 2017 analysis, people who have a diet high in vegetables and other plant foods have a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. </p>
<p> The study authors say that the heart health benefits of a plant-based diet include improved blood lipids and lower blood pressure. </p>
<p> The same research concludes that a vegetarian diet could reverse atherosclerotic plaques when combined with exercise and stress management. </p>
<p> Atherosclerosis occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries. This causes the arteries to harden, narrow, and restrict the blood flow. </p>
<p> Cancer </p>
<p> A pescatarian diet may also protect people against colorectal cancers, or cancers that affect the colon and rectum. </p>
<p> According to a 2015 study, colorectal cancers are the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. </p>
<p> The study used data from a cohort of over 77,650 people and found that the pescatarian diet had a strong protective effect against colorectal cancers. </p>
<p> Diabetes and inflammation </p>
<p> There is also evidence that omega-3s present in fatty fish may reduce inflammation, though this evidence comes from trials of supplements. </p>
<p> Plant-based diets are high in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents, such as flavonoids. These are natural compounds present in plants. Flavonoids have a range of anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic properties. </p>
<p> A 2016 study, again looking at different dietary patterns among more than 77,000 people in the U.S., found that people following a pescatarian diet had the highest flavonoid intake of all those taking part. </p>
<p> Some people choose vegetarian diets because they disagree with factory farming practices or killing animals for food. </p>
<p> For people concerned about animal welfare, the pescatarian diet may be a little more suitable. This is because some scientists argue that fish cannot feel pain. A 2015 study concluded that although fish can experience psychological stress, they lack the neural network necessary to experience pain. </p>
<p> The pescatarian diet may also appeal to those who want to eat foods from what they perceive to be sustainable farming practices. </p>
<p> Is a pescatarian diet sustainable? </p>
<p> The pescatarian diet is more sustainable than factory farming of mammals or birds, but it does have some environmental issues. </p>
<p> Some people believe that the farming of pigs and ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, can harm the environment. Both groups emit greenhouse gases, with ruminants producing methane gas and pigs producing ammonia. </p>
<p> On a global scale, these gases contribute to global warming. Also, large-scale deforestation for grazing and agriculture makes the greenhouse gas issue worse. </p>
<p> Although fish do not produce greenhouse gases, fishing and fisheries represent a challenge to water ecosystems. </p>
<p> For example, eating wild line-caught fish is not necessarily better for the environment than eating farmed fish, and the trawlers used to catch trawler-caught fish can affect ocean ecosystems in many ways. </p>
<p> Some people see farming fish as a solution to over-fishing and depleted fish stocks, and the practice has grown rapidly over the past few years. </p>
<p> However, in certain circumstances, fish farming can: </p>
<p> introduce invasive species </p>
<p> use wild fish for feed </p>
<p> cause overcrowding </p>
<p> The pescatarian diet may also be expensive or difficult to maintain when people live some distance from coastlines or fresh waterways. Some people may also find it hard to access sustainably sourced tinned fish. </p>
<p> Listed below are some suggestions for sources of fish that a person on a pescatarian diet can eat: </p>
<p> canned tuna </p>
<p> fish sticks </p>
<p> pseudo grains, such as quinoa and buckwheat, which are gluten-free </p>
<p> legumes, including kidney beans, pinto beans, and peas </p>
<p> legume products, including tofu and hummus </p>
<p> nuts and nut butters </p>
<p> seeds, such as flaxseeds, hemp seeds, and chia </p>
<p> eggs and dairy, if lacto-ovo-vegetarian </p>
<p> If a person follows a strict pescatarian diet and avoids consuming eggs and dairy, they might need to check their calcium intake and consider taking supplements. </p>
<p> Here, we give examples of recipes for meals that a person might consider when choosing a pescatarian diet: </p>
<p> Sardines are an excellent source of omega-3s. Using spinach to make a pesto spread on the crostini provides a source of vitamin C and vitamin A. The vitamin C helps increase the amount of iron a person absorbs. </p>
<p> This recipe uses canned sardines, but it is also possible to use fresh sardines or anchovies. Starting the day with protein increases the feeling of fullness, and the pesto adds healthful greens that are a source of iron. </p>
<p> Tahini is good source of plant protein and omega-3s. Chickpeas are also a good source of plant protein and fiber. Add a healthful Mediterranean salad to this recipe to create a filling lunch. </p>
<p> Strong-flavored fish go very well with citrus fruits such as grapefruit. The addition of grapefruit to this recipe also adds vitamin C and fiber, and it counts toward the 2 servings of fruit that a person should eat per day. </p>
<p> Heavy metal and pollutants in marine fish is a global issue. With 92 percent of fish consumed by humans being marine fish, mostly from coastal fisheries, there is a risk of contamination. </p>
<p> Mercury is present in the atmosphere and bodies of water and, because of this, nearly all fish may be a source of mercury. </p>
<p> For most people, the mercury present in fish is not a risk, explain the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p>
<p> However, they advise women considering becoming pregnant, women who are pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children not to eat specific fish. </p>
<p> A pescatarian diet may be healthful and carries health benefits, as long as people avoid fish with high levels of mercury. However, this diet may not be as sustainable as some people think. </p>
<p> Plant-based diets can help a person maintain a healthy weight, and they also may help with weight loss when necessary. A pescatarian diet may also be more healthful than some diets that rely on calorie deficits to reduce weight. </p>
<p> People may find that canned tuna and sardines, as well as smoked fish, are the easiest foods to obtain and eat. These are full-flavored options, but frozen white fish and fish sticks are more delicately flavored options. </p>

<p> The health effects of eating maggots </p>
<p> Medically reviewed by Elaine K. Luo, M.D. — Written by Charlotte Lillis on May 29, 2019 </p>
<p> A person may accidentally ingest maggots if they eat spoiled food that has become contaminated with fly larvae. Accidentally eating maggots is generally not a cause for concern, but it can sometimes lead to health complications, such as bacterial poisoning. </p>
<p> A maggot is the larva of the common housefly. Maggots are around 3–12 millimeters in length, have no legs, and are white or cream. </p>
<p> An adult female housefly can lay up to 130 eggs at a time, and each one of these will develop into a single larva. Flies lay their eggs in decaying organic matter, such as spoiled food and animal waste, which serves as food for the developing larvae. </p>
<p> In this article, we explore some of the potential health effects of eating maggots and explain what to do and when to see a doctor after accidentally ingesting them. We also discuss whether people eat maggots intentionally and if it is safe to do so. </p>
<p> Flies can visit multiple food sources throughout the day, and they may carry harmful bacteria that they have picked up from human or animal waste. They can transmit these bacteria to foods that people eat. </p>
<p> Larvae that develop in the contaminated food can ingest these bacteria. People who eat this contaminated food or the larvae will also get exposure to the bacteria and may become unwell. </p>
<p> Salmonella </p>
<p> Salmonella is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness. Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include: </p>
<p> Symptoms typically begin between 12 and 72 hours after a person ingests the bacteria, and the illness usually lasts for 4 to 7 days. </p>
<p> People with Salmonella poisoning often get better without treatment. However, frequent vomiting and diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration and, sometimes, hospitalization. It is, therefore, important for people with Salmonella poisoning to drink plenty of liquid, including clear broths and fruit juices, to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. </p>
<p> E. coli poisoning </p>
<p> There are many different strains of E. coli. Although most strains are harmless, some can cause a person to become very sick. </p>
<p> These symptoms usually develop between 1 and 10 days after ingesting the bacteria and may last for 5–7 days. </p>
<p> An E. coli infection can range in severity from very mild to severe, and it can sometimes even be life-threatening. As with Salmonella poisoning, it is essential for people to drink plenty of liquid to prevent dehydration. </p>
<p> Myiasis occurs when a person becomes infested with fly larvae. The larvae live on or inside the person and survive by feeding off their tissues. </p>
<p> Intestinal myiasis is a type of myiasis that can occur when a person ingests larvae that survive inside the gastrointestinal tract. Some people with intestinal myiasis do not experience any symptoms and may only realize that they have an infestation after noticing larvae in their stools. </p>
<p> However, symptoms of intestinal myiasis can include: </p>
<p> Myiasis is not common in the United States and mainly tends to occur in tropical and subtropical countries, including some of those in Africa and South America. However, people can get myiasis from traveling to these countries. </p>
<p> Accidentally ingesting maggots does not generally cause any lasting harm. However, if a person has ingested maggots through eating spoiled food, they may be at risk of food poisoning. Symptoms of food poisoning can range from very mild to serious, and they can sometimes last for several days. </p>
<p> People with a higher risk of developing food poisoning include: </p>
<p> young children </p>
<p> older adults </p>
<p> those with weakened immune systems, such as people living with HIV or those undergoing an organ transplant </p>
<p> It is essential for people who develop severe vomiting and diarrhea from food poisoning to drink plenty of fluid to prevent dehydration. </p>
<p> A person should see a doctor if any of the following signs and symptoms occur after ingesting maggots: </p>
<p> visible larvae in stools </p>
<p> persistent abdominal pain </p>
<p> symptoms of bacterial poisoning that worsen or do not get better </p>
<p> Many people in countries outside of Europe and North America eat insects. Scientists estimate that there are close to 2,000 species of edible insect. As well as the insects themselves, the eggs and larvae of certain species are edible. </p>
<p> Casu marzu is a Sardinian cheese that contains thousands of maggots. In the early stages of cheese production, the cheesemaker removes the outer crust, which encourages flies to enter and lay their eggs. Over several months, the larvae eat the rotting cheese. Excrement from the larvae gives the cheese its unique, pungent flavor. </p>
<p> Due to the health risks of eating live maggots, the European Food Safety Authority have banned the sale of casu marzu. However, a small number of Sardinian farmers continue to make the cheese for personal consumption. </p>
<p> Maggots are particularly high in protein and fat. As such, scientists are currently investigating the possibility of growing, harvesting, and processing black soldier fly maggots for human consumption. </p>
<p> Scientists have suggested heating, drying, and microwaving the larvae to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. At present, however, there is no guaranteed risk-free way to consume maggots safely. </p>
<p> For most people living in milder climates, such as the U.S., accidentally ingesting maggots is unlikely to cause harm. </p>
<p> People may experience a temporary bout of food poisoning from eating either the contaminated maggots or the spoiled food containing them. However, most cases of food poisoning resolve without treatment after several days. </p>
<p> People should visit a doctor if they experience severe or concerning symptoms after accidentally ingesting maggots. </p>

<p> What causes people to poop right after eating? </p>
<p> People may sometimes feel the urge to poop immediately after eating. When this happens, the person may feel as though the food is passing straight through them. However, this is not the case. </p>
<p> In fact, it can take 1–2 days before food finishes its journey through a person’s digestive tract. Therefore, a person who poops shortly after eating is likely to be passing food that they ate a day or two earlier. </p>
<p> The most likely cause of needing to poop right after eating is the gastrocolic reflex. This reflex is a normal involuntary reaction to food entering the stomach. However, the intensity of the gastrocolic reflex can vary among individuals. </p>
<p> In this article, we outline what happens during the gastrocolic reflex and discuss the conditions that can increase its intensity. We also explain the dietary and lifestyle factors that can help reduce the urge to poop right after eating. </p>
<p> The gastrocolic reflex, or gastrocolic response, is a normal involuntary reaction to food entering the stomach. </p>
<p> When food enters this organ, the body releases a hormone that causes the colon to contract. These contractions move previously eaten food further through the digestive system, which can result in the urge to pass stool. </p>
<p> For some people, the gastrocolic reflex is mild, causing no symptoms. For others, the gastrocolic reflex is intense, and the urge to poop after eating can be particularly severe. </p>
<p> Certain health conditions can affect the gastrocolic reflex. For example, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can cause a person’s digestive tract to move food through their system at a much faster rate. </p>
<p> Other conditions that could cause a person to pass stool more quickly than average include: </p>
<p> Each of the above conditions may increase the intensity of the gastrocolic reflex, resulting in an urge to poop soon after eating. They may also give rise to additional digestive symptoms, such as: </p>
<p> Another potential cause of feeling the urge to poop is fecal incontinence. The condition may range in severity from mild to a complete loss of bowel control. </p>
<p> Fecal incontinence is relatively easy to differentiate from the effects of an intense gastrocolic response to food. Specifically, fecal incontinence can occur at any time. It does not only occur after eating. </p>
<p> A person may develop fecal incontinence for several different reasons, including: </p>
<p> People who are concerned that they may have fecal incontinence should visit their doctor for a diagnosis. A doctor can explain the many different ways to treat and manage fecal incontinence. </p>
<p> An episode of diarrhea following a meal is unlikely to relate to the person’s gastrocolic reflex. </p>
<p> Diarrhea is a common condition that typically only lasts a day or two. However, diarrhea that lasts for a week or more could indicate an underlying health issue. </p>
<p> Some common causes of persistent diarrhea include: </p>
<p> excessive consumption of artificial sweeteners and other laxatives </p>
<p> food intolerances </p>
<p> The gastrocolic reflex is a normal reaction to food entering the stomach. In most cases, feeling the urge to poop after eating does not warrant a visit to the doctor. </p>
<p> However, a person should see their doctor if they experience the following: </p>
<p> intense and frequent gastrocolic responses to food </p>
<p> diarrhea lasting longer than 2 days </p>
<p> additional gastric symptoms </p>
<p> The above symptoms could indicate a possible underlying health issue. </p>
<p> As the gastrocolic reflex is a normal bodily reaction, it does not technically require treatment. However, there are steps that people can take to help reduce the intensity of the gastrocolic reflex and the associated urge to poop. </p>
<p> Seek treatment for underlying digestive conditions </p>
<p> People should see a doctor if other gastric symptoms accompany the urge to poop after eating. </p>
<p> Depending on the duration and severity of these symptoms, a doctor may carry out tests to diagnose any underlying health conditions. </p>
<p> If a condition is present, treating it may help reduce the intensity of the gastrocolic reflex. </p>
<p> Changing the diet </p>
<p> Some foods are more likely than others to cause an intense gastrocolic response. These include: </p>
<p> fatty or greasy foods </p>
<p> dairy products </p>
<p> foods high in fiber </p>
<p> Keeping a food diary can help a person identify foods that may be intensifying their gastrocolic response. The diary should contain a record of the foods that the person eats, as well as their digestive response to the foods. </p>
<p> Once the person has identified a possible trigger food, they should temporarily avoid the food to see whether their symptoms improve. </p>
<p> Managing stress </p>
<p> For some people, stress can increase the intensity of the gastrocolic reflex. These individuals may benefit from activities that help reduce stress. Examples include exercise and meditation. </p>
<p> Passing stool immediately after a meal is usually the result of the gastrocolic reflex, which is a normal bodily reaction to food entering the stomach. </p>
<p> Almost everyone will experience the effects of the gastrocolic reflex from time to time. However, its intensity can vary from person to person. Certain lifestyle factors can help reduce the urge to poop following a meal. </p>
<p> People should see a doctor if they frequently experience diarrhea or other gastric symptoms following a meal. These symptoms could indicate an underlying health issue that requires medical attention. </p>

<p> When you're looking to upgrade your diet, breakfast is a good place to start. Many typical breakfast foods — pancakes, muffins, waffles and bacon — are high in fat, sugar and simple carbs that give you an immediate rush of energy but leave you feeling flat by mid-morning. Fruit, on the other hand, is a rich source of carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins and minerals that fill you up and give you energy. Pair fruit with a source of lean protein for a day that's off to a great start. </p>
<p> Fruit in the Morning </p>
<p> The secret to a satisfying breakfast that ticks all the nutritional boxes and keeps you going until lunch is choosing a combination of foods that provide: </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Complex carbohydrates, which provide long-lasting energy as well as fiber to fill you up </p>
<p> Fruit is a healthy way to get complex carbs. Although fruits are rich in naturally occurring sugars, they're considered complex carbs — not simple carbs — because they contain dietary fiber. Fiber is the parts of plants that pass through your system mostly undigested. Fiber adds bulk to foods and slows digestion and absorption of the fruit sugars to provide long-lasting energy. </p>
<p> Nutrition of Various Fruits </p>
<p> Eating fruit will help you meet your daily nutrition goals. Along with dietary fiber, fruit is also a rich source of vitamins A and C and the mineral potassium. Vitamin C is important for the health of your immune system and the growth and repair of cells; vitamin A boosts skin and eye health and fights infection; and potassium helps control blood pressure. </p>
<p> According to the Institute of Medicine, men need 38 grams of fiber and women need 25 grams of fiber each day. One cup of fresh blueberries contains only 84 calories and 3.6 grams of fiber — 9 to 15 percent of your daily fiber needs. One medium apple with skin contains even more fiber — 4.4 grams — and one medium banana provides 3.1 grams. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 90 mg for men and 75 mg for women. One cup of blueberries provides 14.4 mg; one medium apple has 8.4 mg; and one medium banana contains 10.3 mg. You'll get between 9 and 19 percent of your daily vitamin C depending on the fruit you choose and whether you're male or female. </p>
<p> For vitamin A, the recommendation is 700 mcg for women and 900 mcg for men. A cup of blueberries provides 80 mcg; a medium apple offers 98 mg; and a medium banana contains 76 mcg. </p>
<p> All adults need 4,700 mg of potassium each day. Bananas are one of the best sources of potassium, and one medium banana provides almost 10 percent of the daily requirement. A medium apple contains 195 mg, and a cup of blueberries offers 114 mg. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A Low-Calorie Addition </p>
<p> Many fruits are low in calories compared to the volume of food they provide. Strawberries, grapefruit, peaches, papaya and cantaloupe all provide fewer than 60 calories per serving. You can indulge in these sweet treats each morning without going over your breakfast calorie budget. </p>
<p> Other fruits are higher in calories, which is good to know if you're watching your weight. Mangos, grapes, cherries and bananas have more calories and sugar and should be eaten in moderation. A whole mango, for example, provides 45 grams of sugar. Although it's natural sugar, it still adds to your total calorie intake for the day. </p>
<p> The Perfect Pairing </p>
<p> Some delicious fruit combinations include strawberries, raspberries and blueberries; grapefruit, kiwi and strawberry; and blackberries, papaya and cantaloupe. Slice up your favorites and serve them topped with plain Greek yogurt packed with protein, a piece of whole-grain toast with unsweetened nut butter or an egg any way you like it. </p>

<p> You need to consume less calories if you want to lose weight. </p>

<p> Losing weight requires you to eat fewer calories than you burn. Choosing healthy foods and moderate portions keeps your calorie intake in check. Chicken, fruits and vegetables are healthy, as long as they're not fried or drenched in a creamy or sugary sauce. If you stick to these foods and control your portions, you may lose weight. </p>
<p> However, you may may miss out on some valuable nutrients offered by dairy, whole grains and healthy fats, so including a variety of foods and tracking your intake on an online calorie counter, is a better option for a healthy weight-loss plan. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> You may lose weight eating a chicken, vegetable and fruit focused diet, but only if you're consuming fewer calories than your burn. These foods don't contain magical nutrients to melt those unwanted pounds. </p>
<p> Weight Loss 101 </p>
<p> Creating a moderate caloric deficit causes your body to use fat for energy, resulting in weight loss. The deficit occurs when you eat less and move more. When the deficit is equal to 250 to 1,000 calories daily, you lose between 1/2 pound and 2 pounds per week. </p>
<p> Figure out your daily calorie needs by using an online calculator like MyPlate, or consulting with a health care provider. This number equals the number of calories you must consume to maintain the weight you have now. You need to increase your calorie burn through exercise, reduce your daily calorie intake, or combine these two strategies to successfully drop pounds. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> An intake between 1,200 and 1,600 calories is considered low, and will most likely help you lose weight. Consuming fewer calories is not advised, as you will accelerate the loss of muscle mass, stall your metabolism and miss out on important nutrition. </p>
<p> Aim to consume 45 to 65 percent of your calories from carbohydrates, 10 to 35 percent from protein and 20 to 35 percent from fat, minimizing saturated fat as much as possible. At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, supports healthy weight goals. </p>
<p> Choosing Chicken for Weight Loss </p>
<p> Foods that contain lots of saturated fat, sugar and refined grains are discouraged on a weight-loss plan, because they contain excessive calories and usually don't have a lot of nutritional value. White-meat chicken, fresh vegetables and fresh fruit make sense as part of many weight-loss menus, because they're low in these diet saboteurs. However, these foods aren't free of calories. If you eat too much of any of them — or if you always choose dark-meat chicken with the skin — you could go over your calorie allotment, which would stall your weight loss efforts. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A cup of roasted, light-meat chicken contains 214 calories, 6 grams of fat — with 2 grams of saturated fat — and 38 grams of protein. A chicken drumstick with the skin -- which is actually a smaller serving than the cup of light-meat — contains 232 calories, 12 grams of fat, with 3 grams of that as saturated fat, and 32 grams of protein. While the calorie count seems reasonable, you'll likely eat several servings per day. </p>
<p> Grilled, roasted, baked or broiled chicken breast are optimal choices. Sauteed chicken, crisped patties or fried breasts have considerably more calories and saturated fat. One fried chicken breast contains 490 calories and a chicken Parmesan entree at a restaurant offers up 614 calories — and that's without the pasta. Butter or cream sauces and barbecue-sauce calories can also add up quickly. For example, a mere tablespoon of barbecue sauce adds 30 calories and 6 grams of sugar. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Vegetables and Fruits </p>
<p> Watery, fibrous vegetables such as leafy greens, celery and cucumbers are inherently low in calories, but fruit calories can add up quickly. One serving of some fruits have almost three times the number of calories as non-starchy vegetables. A medium banana contains 105 calories, a cup of pineapple has 83 calories. Avocado is probably this highest-calorie fruit with 240 calories per cup, cubed. Although fruits add important nutrients to your diet, their calorie density may become an issue if you eat them as if they are "free" foods. Enjoy fruits as part of your weight-loss diet, just limit your servings. </p>
<p> Starchy vegetables are higher in calories than leafy greens, but they contain valuable nutrients and fiber. Consume 4 to 5 cups per week to balance your diet, advises the U.S. Department of Agriculture ChooseMyPlate.gov website. Watch your servings, though, because a large baked potato contains 290 calories and a cup of corn has 143 calories. Compare this to the 7 calories in a cup of raw spinach or the 54 calories in a cup of boiled broccoli. </p>
<p> Also consider how you dress up your vegetables. A tablespoon of butter increases your calorie intake by 100 calories and adds 11 grams of fat. Ranch dressing poured over a salad costs you 63 calories per tablespoon and 7 grams of fat. Fresh herbs, citrus juice, balsamic vinegar and small amounts of olive oil are better options. </p>
<p> Variety Is Best for Dieting </p>
<p> While you can keep calories in line by eating only fruit, veggies and chicken, no single fruit or vegetable offers all the nutrients you need, so be sure to eat a wide variety. For example, don't always stick to Romaine lettuce, tomatoes and carrots. Other options such as cooked tomatoes, dark leafy greens, orange and red vegetables, and dried beans and peas offer variety to your weekly menu. </p>
<p> Eliminating all dairy or dairy alternatives from your diet puts you at risk of being deficient in vitamin D and bone-building calcium. If you don't drink cow's milk or fortified soy, almond or coconut milk, be sure to include kale, broccoli and Chinese cabbage regularly. Fish with soft bones, such as sardines and salmon, could be a protein alternative to chicken that provides calcium and other important minerals. Fish also offers omega-3 fatty acids that you need for brain health. Other sources of omega-3 fatty acids include walnuts and flax seeds, which could embellish your salads. </p>
<p> Skipping grains — especially whole grains such as quinoa and brown rice — can also leave you without certain valuable nutrients. Although fruits and vegetables contain fiber, whole grains can helps contribute to the 25 to 38 grams you need daily for good digestive health. Grains are also an important source of zinc, iron and B vitamins. Consider including at least 1/2 to 1 cup of grains at most meals. </p>

<p> Why Does My Blood Glucose Drop After Eating? </p>

Perkins also has extensive experience working in home health with medically fragile pediatric patients. </p>
<p> When you feel hungry, eating should make you feel better. But for some people, eating makes them feel worse, due to a drop in blood sugar that occurs within one to three hours after they eat certain types of meals, according to Frank Jackson, M.D. of Jackson/Siegelbaum Gastroenterology. This reaction, called reactive hypoglycemia, can cause a number of unpleasant side effects. Reactive hypoglycemia can also indicate insulin resistance, often considered a forerunner of diabetes, the National Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disorders states. </p>
<p> Mechanism </p>
<p> Glucose is essential for energy; your body breaks down the foods you eat into glucose, which must be absorbed into the cells. When glucose enters the bloodstream, your body releases insulin to facilitate its absorption into the cells. In some people, too much insulin is released in response to glucose. The insulin removes too much glucose from the bloodstream, and blood sugar levels drop. People with insulin resistance have higher than normal amounts of circulating insulin because their cells have become resistant to the effects of insulin; it takes a larger amount of insulin to get the cells to respond and remove glucose from the bloodstream. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Glycemia Load and Glycemic Index </p>
<p> Foods that have a high glycemic index, which means that they break down more rapidly into glucose after being eaten, raise blood sugar very quickly. Generally speaking, carbohydrate foods high in refined sugars or simple sugars have a high glycemic index. The sudden influx of glucose causes the release of large amounts of insulin, which removes too much glucose and causes blood glucose to drop. Eating foods with a low glycemic index helps avoid dropping blood sugar levels after eating. Glycemic load, which considers the amount of carbohydrates in a food along with its glycemic index, determines a food's effect on your blood sugar. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> What to Eat </p>
<p> Foods high in carbohydrates have a bigger immediate impact on your blood sugar levels than proteins or fats. But not all high-carbohydrate foods have a high glycemic load. Fruits, for example, which consist of simple sugars, have a low glycemic load because they contain fewer carbohydrates than some other foods and they're also high in fiber. High fiber foods like fruits and vegetable slow food breakdown, which helps stabilize blood glucose levels. Soda, which contains a lot of carbohydrates and simple sugars, has a much higher glycemic load and can cause your blood glucose to rise quickly right after drinking. Refined grains have a higher glycemic load than whole grains. Eating protein and some fat with a meal slows food digestion, which also results in a slower rise in blood glucose. Registered dietitian Joanne Larson recommends following a diet made up of 20 percent protein, 30 percent fat and around 130 grams of carbohydrates per day if you have hypoglycemia. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Symptoms and Treatment </p>
<p> Symptoms of hypoglycemia include sweating, shakiness, weakness, lightheadedness, confusion, difficulty speaking and possibly fainting. When you first feel symptoms of hypoglycemia, eat a protein-based food such as cheese or a piece of meat along with a small amount of carbohydrate, such as a piece of fruit. Do not eat a piece of candy, as is often recommended for diabetics with hypoglycemia, Larson warns. Simple sugars will raise your blood sugar quickly, but another large insulin release could cause rebound hypoglycemia. Preventing symptoms from developing by following a diet low in refined carbohydrates helps prevent reactive hypoglycemia from developing. </p>

<p> Eating the right foods can help you manage your gastritis symptoms. </p>
<p> Image Credit: Sinenkiy/iStock/GettyImages </p>
<p> Gastritis is the umbrella term for a number of medical conditions that all cause a common symptom: inflammation of the stomach lining. While the causes and other symptoms of gastritis can vary widely, one factor worth taking a look at is what you're eating. Yes, a gastritis diet may help. </p>
<p> It can also occur in reaction to medications like NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like aspirin or ibuprofen) or to excessive alcohol (called reactive gastropathy), to attacks from the body's own immune system (autoimmune gastritis) or problems due to low blood flow to the stomach lining (stress gastritis). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> "Gastritis can be either acute — it happens all of a sudden — or chronic — it happens over time," says Kellie Gragg, MPH, RDN, a dietitian/nutritionist and director of clinical services at Strata Integrated Wellness and Spa in Colorado Springs, Colorado. </p>
<p> The Mayo Clinic says gastritis symptoms and risk factors also can vary. For example, some people have no symptoms whatsoever, while others experience nausea, vomiting or burning aches or pains in the abdomen. What's most important is that you get a proper diagnosis so that you can get the right treatment. This can vary from antibiotics to kill ​H. pylori​ to medications that neutralize excess acid in your digestive system. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> How Food Can Work for You </p>
<p> Although gastritis refers to medical conditions that impact the lining of the stomach, food itself is rarely a cause, according to the NIDDK. The dietary factors that can play a role include food allergies, celiac disease, excess alcohol consumption and iron supplements — all have been linked to cases of gastritis. </p>
<p> Of note is that certain cases of gastritis can lead to nutrient deficiencies that may require special diets or supplements to remedy the situation. Working closely with your doctor and a dietitian can ensure that you get the nutrients you need. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> On the other hand, once you have gastritis, the foods you eat can play a role in lessening the severity of your gastritis symptoms, Gragg says. She recommends the following foods for help in managing gastritis, fighting inflammation and easing the discomfort along with what to avoid, which can be just as important as what you eat: </p>
<p> ​Low-fat foods.​ Keep fat intake at a healthy level by choosing lean proteins and fat-free dairy. Skip the fatty cuts of meat and foods high in saturated fat. </p>
<p> ​High-fiber foods.​ Vegetables, whole grains like barley, beans, and fruits, notably berries and apples with their skins, promote overall digestive health. </p>
<p> ​Fermented foods.​ "Fermented foods are generally recognized as crucial for contributing to healthy gut microbiota," says Gragg. Good choices include kombucha, yogurt, kimchi, miso and sauerkraut. </p>
<p> ​Non-caffeinated, non-carbonated beverages.​ Coffee, teas and soda can be irritating for people with sensitive stomachs. Remember, when all else fails, water is always an excellent choice for hydration. </p>
<p> The Mayo Clinic cautions against eating dishes that are spicy, fried or highly acidic as well as fatty as these can all aggravate your stomach. The size and frequency of your meals count, too. </p>
<p> "First of all, don't overeat," says Zachary T. Weik, MHS, PA-C, a physician assistant and assistant professor of medical science at Arcadia University in Glenside, Pennsylvania. "A fully expanded stomach will have difficulty breaking down the food in a timely manner and moving it along into the bowels." </p>
<p> "Smaller, more frequent meals would be recommended," Weik says. "Also, avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after eating to allow gravity to work in your body's favor and avoid reflux." </p>

<p> (6) And when the woman saw . . . she took.--Heb., And the woman saw . . . and she took, &c. In this, the original form of the narrative, we see the progress of the temptation detailed in a far more lively manner than in our version. With awakened desire the woman gazes upon the tree. The fruit appears inviting to the eye, and possibly was really good for food. The whole aspect of the tree was beautiful; and, besides, there was the promise held out to her that it possessed the mysterious faculty of developing her intellectual powers. To this combined influence of her senses without and her ambition within she was unable to offer that resistance which would have been possible only by a living faith in the spoken word of God. She eats, therefore, and gives to her husband--so called here for the first time--and he eats with her. The demeanour of Adam throughout is extraordinary. It is the woman who is tempted--not as though Adam was not present, as Milton supposes, for she has not to seek him--but he shares with her at once the gathered fruit. Rather, she is pictured to us as more quick and observant, more open to impressions, more curious and full of longings than the man, whose passive behaviour is as striking as the woman's eagerness and excitability. </p>
<p> Verse 6. - And (when) the woman saw. "An impure look, infected with the poison of concupiscence" (Calvin); cf. Joshua 7:21. That the tree was good for food. "The fruit of this tree may have been neither poisonous nor beautiful, or it may have been both; but sin has the strange power of investing the object of desire for the time being, whatever its true character, with a wonderful attraction" (Inglis). And that it (was) pleasant Literally, a desire (Psalm 10:17), a lust (Numbers 11:4). To the eyes. Ἀριστὸν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς (LXX.); pulchrum oculis (Vulgate); lustye unto the eyes (Coverdale); i.e. stimulating desire through the eyes (cf. 1 John 2:16).

<p> Coumadin, also known as warfarin, is a blood thinner used to reduce blood clot formation and prevent blocked arteries, heart attacks and strokes. Many foods are safe to eat while taking Coumadin, but some can affect how well your Coumadin works. </p>
<p> Vitamin K acts as a natural blood-clotting agent within the body and can therefore interact with Coumadin and make it less effective. While taking Coumadin, it's necessary to consume consistent amounts of vitamin K in your diet. The daily adequate intake of vitamin K for adult males is 120 micrograms per day; for adult females, it's 90 micrograms per day, according to the Institute of Medicine. </p>
<p> Low Vitamin K Veggies </p>
<p> Vegetables are rich in many nutrients, including vitamin K. Leafy and green vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, spinach, Brussels sprouts, collards and kale, are especially good sources of vitamin K. This doesn't mean that you have to avoid these vegetables, however; you simply need to consume approximately the same amount each day. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can also choose from low vitamin K vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, celery, peas, peeled cucumbers, peppers, eggplant, tomatoes and zucchini. On average, you should eat two to four servings of vegetables per day, with a serving equal to 1 cup of raw vegetables or 1/2 cup of cooked vegetables. </p>
<p> Pack in Nutrition With Fruit </p>
<p> Fruit is an excellent source of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and fiber and contains low levels of vitamin K so you can eat it freely. Good fruit choices include oranges, kiwifruits, grapes, bananas, prunes, cranberry juice, melon, plums, raisins, fruit cocktail, blueberries and applesauce. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A serving is equal to one medium piece of fruit; 1/2 cup of canned, frozen or cut-up fresh fruit; 1/3 cup of dried fruit; or 4 ounces of fruit juice. On average, you should eat two to four servings of fruit per day. </p>
<p> Dairy Foods for Calcium and Protein </p>
<p> Dairy products are low in vitamin K and are acceptable on a Coumadin diet. Milk, cheese, cream, yogurt and ice cream are examples of dairy products you may consume. Eat two to three 1-cup servings of dairy each day. </p>
<p> While all of these foods are considered safe while you're taking Coumadin, it's best to consume low-fat or nonfat dairy products when possible. This will help you maintain a healthy weight and prevent other complications. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Meat, Poultry and Fish </p>
<p> Chicken, turkey, duck, beef, steak, veal, ham and pork are acceptable when taking Coumadin, except for beef and chicken livers, which are rich in vitamin K. Avoid high-fat selections, such as sausage, bacon and bologna when possible. </p>
<p> Fish such as haddock, salmon, trout, mackerel, tuna and shellfish, including clams, oysters and shrimp are also good choices. Fish is especially beneficial as it's high in the essential fatty acid omega-3. You may also eat eggs, but only in moderation as they're high in cholesterol. On average, you should eat three servings of high-protein foods each day. </p>
<p> Nutrient-Rich Starches and Grains </p>
<p> Most breads, cereals and grains are low in vitamin K. You should eat six to eight servings of food from this group daily, choosing whole grains when possible. Good examples of acceptable foods from the starch and grain group include oatmeal, wheat bread and pasta, brown rice, quinoa, millet, couscous, cream of wheat, cereal grains, rye and granola. </p>

<p> Crikey! Crocodiles and Alligators Snack on Fruit </p>
<p> Adult American alligator. (Image credit: Dennis Demcheck , U.S. Geological Survey ) </p>
<p> Crocodiles and alligators are infamous carnivores, but it turns out they do not live on meat alone — scientists have unexpectedly discovered that these predators occasionally snack on fruit as well. </p>
<p> These surprising findings suggest crocodilians — which include alligators, crocodiles and their close relatives — might, via seeds they poop out or regurgitate, act a bit like Johnny Appleseed, helping forests grow by planting seeds across their territories. </p>
<p> Scientists investigated 18 species of crocodilian, ranging from the American alligator to the fearsome Nile crocodile, and found evidence that 13 of those species devoured fruit of some kind, including a variety of berries, legumes, nuts and grains. </p>
<p> "Crocodilians consume fruits, and such behavior seems very common, contrary to what people have thought for many years," said researcher Steven Platt, a herpetologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society. [Alligators vs. Crocodiles: Photos Reveal Who's Who] </p>
<p> Although, at times, the reptiles ate the fruit accidentally — for instance, if the fruit was in the guts of prey they captured — the researchers found evidence that the fruit was also consumed deliberately and in large quantities. For instance, scientists have seen crocodilians eating wild grapes, elderberries and citrus fruit directly from trees. </p>
<p> "I had found seeds in crocodiles before, but I had just assumed they were not important — and when I talked with other crocodilian biologists, everyone had the same experience," Platt told LiveScience. "Everyone just rejected the notion that crocodilians eat fruit because everyone supposed they only ate meat." </p>
<p> Although early research suggested crocodilians were unable to digest sugars and other plant-based nutrients, subsequent work with the American alligator has demonstrated otherwise. Crocodilians do not chew — any fruit would likely get swallowed whole to digest in the strong acids of their guts. </p>
<p> "Crocodilians always surprise us," Platt said. "I've been doing research on them for 25 years, and I'm still learning something new all the time — they're fascinating animals." </p>
<p> Crocodilians might potentially spread plants far and wide, researchers suggested. </p>
<p> "Some crocodilians make transoceanic journeys — some crocodilians, such as the saltwater crocodile, have been found to wander 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), swimming from island to island," Platt said. "There are all sorts of interesting implications there for the movement of plants across islands." </p>
<p> The researchers would now like to feed fruit to crocodilians to see what happens to the seeds. </p>
<p> "Do they regurgitate them out their mouths, or do they come out in their feces?" Platt asked. "What effects do their guts have on the seeds?" </p>
<p> The scientists detailed their findings in the July issue of the Journal of Zoology. </p>

<p> Make sure to drink a lot of water before a colonoscopy. </p>

<p> Preparing for your colonoscopy is something to take seriously and usually begins a few days before your scheduled procedure. You may be required to restrict certain foods in your diet at least 48 hours before a colonoscopy. The goal is to empty your colon so that detection of any abnormalities is successful. It's crucial to follow the preparation instructions that your physician provides, especially because instructions may vary slightly based on your unique circumstances. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> To prepare your bowels, you will need to eat a low-fiber diet a few days before your colonoscopy. The day before the procedure, you shouldn't eat any solid foods, but you may drink clear liquids and broths. </p>
<p> Purpose of Colonoscopy </p>
<p> A colonoscopy is an exam performed to detect changes or abnormalities in the large intestine and rectum. Inadequate preparation of the colon can hamper adenoma detection during a colonoscopy. Your colon is a part of your digestive system that absorbs water, salt and nutrients from the stool and passes waste material along to the rectum. The most common reason physicians recommend a colonoscopy is to detect changes or growths, such as polyps, in the large intestine and rectum. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The majority of polyps pose no harm, but a small chance exists that certain polyps may become cancerous over a period of several years. Early detection and treatment is key to increasing your chances for recovery if you develop colorectal cancer. </p>
<p> Dietary Restrictions Before Colonoscopy </p>
<p> Emptying the contents of your colon is an important requirement for a successful colonoscopy To make sure you have a clean colon, certain foods need to be restricted two days before a colonoscopy. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Texas A&M Health Science Center advises you to refrain from eating beans, peas, corn, nuts, popcorn, okra or tomatoes, two to three days prior to the colonoscopy. The seeds from these foods can stick to your intestinal walls and prevent you from having a clean colon during your procedure. </p>
<p> Boston Medical Center advises its patients that whole grains, seeds of any type, and green vegetables should be included in foods to avoid before a colonoscopy procedure. You're allowed to eat anything that's not on the restricted list that your doctor provides. </p>
<p> Increase Your Water Intake </p>
<p> It is crucial to make sure to drink enough water in preparation for your colonoscopy to help wash food through your system. You need to drink at least 8 glasses of water each day, starting two days before colonoscopy procedures, according to Boston Medical Center. Extra fluid is beneficial — even an additional 8 to 16 ounces can help you before, during and after your bowel prep, as well as after your colonoscopy. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Day Before </p>
<p> The day before your procedure you can expect to follow a liquid diet consisting of clear, sugar-free liquids that are not red or purple. Some examples include bouillon, coffee without milk or non-dairy cream, and sugar-free soft drinks. You should not eat or drink anything after midnight before your appointment. </p>
<p> Discontinue Your Medications </p>
<p> Your doctor may advise that you stop taking certain medication or supplements such as iron, aspirin and the blood-thinner warfarin up to six days before the procedure. Avoid stopping any medication without first confirming it with your gastroenterologist and primary-care physician. </p>

<p> A metallic taste in your mouth is related to a food allergy. </p>
<p> A metallic taste in your mouth after eating is a sign of a food allergy. Although most food allergies cause mild to moderate reactions, a metallic taste in your mouth might be a sign of a severe allergic reaction. Stop eating foods that cause this reaction to occur and make an appointment with an allergist to discuss tests and treatment options. Some foods are more likely to cause an allergic reaction, but you can develop an allergic reaction to any food. </p>

<p> About a fourth of people in the U.S. think they have a food allergy, but actually have a food intolerance, according to FamilyDoctor.org. Food allergies are an abnormal immune system reaction to a food that is considered safe to eat. Food intolerances are not related to the immune system, but are rather a digestive defect that makes it difficult for you to digest certain foods or ingredients. Only about 2 percent of adults in the U.S. have a genuine food allergy. A metallic taste in your mouth is an identifiable symptom of a food allergy, not a food intolerance. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Common Foods </p>
<p> Foods that are commonly responsible for allergic reactions include shellfish, tree nuts, fruits, tomatoes, fish, peanuts and some food additives, such as MSG, or monosodium glutamate. Eating these foods can cause your immune system to send your body into defense mode, triggering antibodies and other chemicals to be released into your bloodstream. Symptoms, such as a metallic taste in your mouth, can form in a few minutes or up to an hour after you eat the food. </p>
<p> Anaphylaxis Warning </p>
<p> A metallic taste in your mouth might be an alarming symptom related to a severe allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis occurs when your body reacts systematically to a food allergen that can cause your airways to swell, your throat to close off, your blood pressure to fall and your heart rate to increase. If you develop facial swelling, hives and a metallic taste in your mouth, you need to get emergency medical attention immediately, according to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network. </p>

<p> Treatment </p>
<p> The most effective treatment for any food-related allergy is to avoid consumption of foods to which you have been diagnosed as allergic. Once you eat such a food, the symptoms will not subside until the proteins from that food are expelled from the body. Anaphylaxis is treated with an injection of epinephrine, a prescribed medication that is administered intravenously. </p>

<p> Fad diets such as a meat and fruit diet are meant to encourage short-term weight loss, and they can be successful. However, there are potential risks to eating such a limited variety of foods, and there's no guarantee that you'll lose any weight as a result of following the plan. </p>
<p> Calories </p>
<p> Before you start to follow any new diet plan, it's important to understand that the number of calories you eat and burn is what determines weight loss, not the specific foods you choose. You must burn more calories than you consume over an extended time to successfully lose weight, and the only way a meat and fruit diet could accomplish that would be if it lowered your daily calorie totals. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Nutrition Facts </p>
<p> The nutrition facts of the foods you eat on the diet make a difference. Filling up on low-calorie foods is more likely to lead to weight loss than choosing energy-dense foods that are high in calories and fat. According to the USDA, for example, a cup of watermelon pieces has only about 45 calories, but a large banana has about 135 calories. Even greater variation is present in meat products. A few slices of turkey deli meat have about 100 calories and 1 g fat, but a large sirloin steak has close to 1,000 calories and 65 g fat. </p>
<p> Balance </p>
<p> Because a meat and fruit diet excludes major food groups and disregards balanced eating, it's not sustainable in the long term, and you may put any weight you lose right back on when you quit following the diet. A safer and more reliable way to lose weight, according to the National Institutes of Health, is to follow a low-calorie diet that includes a balance of items from every major food group. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Results </p>
<p> The amount of weight you can lose by eating just meat and fruit is dependent upon how many calories you consume. If you normally eat about 2,000 calories and the new diet brings you down to 1,500 daily, for example, you'll lose about a pound per week, or a total of two pounds. If you eat closer to just 1,000 calories per day, you could lose two pounds per week. The amount of physical activity you do also makes a difference; if you exercise more during the diet period, you may lose more weight. </p>
<p> Considerations </p>
<p> Talk with your doctor or a registered dietitian before you make any big changes to your current eating plan. According to MayoClinic.com, the most successful weight loss diets tend to include foods that are nutritious and balanced, that you enjoy eating and that you will want to eat indefinitely, since weight loss and weight maintenance are lifelong processes. Eating just fruit and meat at the expense of other food groups has the risk of leading to nutrient deficiencies, fatigue or other health problems. </p>

<p> Fruits, vegetables and fish should be the basis of any healthy diet. Together they provide essential vitamins and minerals, fiber and lean protein. To ensure that you get the proper nutrients while on a diet, eat a variety of colors of fruits and vegetables, as well as different types of fish. Many diet plans, such as the Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH, and the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes, or TLC, not only include these foods groups as a base, but also include healthy whole grains as well. </p>
<p> Colorful Vegetables </p>
<p> A serving is 1 cup of cooked or raw vegetables or juice, or 2 cups of leafy greens. </p>
<p> Image Credit: Medioimages/Photodisc/Photodisc/Getty Images </p>
<p> Each vegetable has a unique set of nutrients. For example, red peppers contain vitamin C, while carrots get their orange color from beta carotene. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend vegetables in a variety of colors, with a focus on dark green, red and orange vegetables, and beans and peas. To get the recommended minimum intake of 2 1/2 cups for women and 3 cups for men, make sure at least one quarter of your plate is vegetables. </p>

<p> Nutritive Fruits </p>
<p> A half cup of dried fruit is equal to a 1-cup serving of whole fruits and juices. </p>

<p> Whole fruits, not fruit juice, provide fiber, which will help you to feel full on fewer calories. Fruit and fruit juices are a natural source of sugar, which gives you energy. Fruits provide many nutrients that are underconsumed, including potassium, vitamin C and folic acid. Adult women and men need 2 cups of fruits each day, so make room on your plate at meals and snacks, and try a variety of fresh or frozen fruits. Eat canned fruit in moderation -- and avoid varieties canned in syrup -- and watch your portion sizes when eating dried fruit, because it's high in calories. </p>

<p> Protein-Packed Fish </p>
<p> Consuming 8 ounces each week of a variety of seafood contributes to the prevention of heart disease. </p>
<p> Image Credit: Stockbyte/Stockbyte/Getty Images </p>
<p> Fish provides lean protein, which is the building block for muscles, enzymes, hormones and vitamins. Adult women need 5 to 5 1/2 ounces and men need 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 ounces of protein foods each day, depending on age. Three ounces is a typical serving of fish, with the protein amounts varying among varieties. The highest-protein fish is tuna at a total of 26 grams per 3-ounce serving, with swordfish at the low end at 16 grams for the same size serving. Some fish also provide omega-3 fatty acids, which can decrease triglyceride levels, slow the growth of plaque in the arteries and slightly lower blood pressure. The American Heart Association recommends that you consume two 3.5-ounce servings of salmon, mackerel, herring or tuna, which provide Omega-3s. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Other Food Groups </p>
<p> A healthy diet can include all food groups, even carbohydrates like whole grains. Magnesium, which is important in releasing energy from muscle, and selenium, which supports a healthy immune system, are just two of the nutrients found in whole grains. Aim to make at least half -- if not all -- of the grains you eat whole. Choose from whole grain wheat, oats, brown rice or quinoa. </p>

<p> Eating fruit instead of sugary desserts can improve your health. </p>
<p> Image Credit: istetiana/Moment/GettyImages </p>
<p> With its various bright hues and sweet and sour flavors, fresh fruit is like nature's candy. If you're watching your weight or just trying to eat healthier, eating fruit after a meal instead of sugary desserts can save you calories and up your nutrient intake for the day. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> Eating fruit after a meal isn't bad for you. On the contrary, eating fruit instead of sugary desserts can improve your health. </p>
<p> Fruit After a Meal Myths </p>
<p> There are a lot of myths out there about when you should and shouldn't eat certain types of food. One of those is that, when eaten after a meal, fruit loses some of its nutritional value, or that your body somehow doesn't absorb all the nutrients. Another is that when fruit mixes with the food you've just consumed and with digestive juices, the combined mass begins to rot. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Neither of these rumors is true, says the Produce for Better Health Foundation. The misinformation probably comes from traditional Indian dietary principles that say certain foods shouldn't be mixed. But there's no modern scientific evidence that supports this theory. </p>
<p> The only reasons eating fruit post-meal may be contraindicated are purely individual. For example, if you suffer from heartburn and you eat citrus fruits after dinner, it could trigger acid reflux, especially if you go to bed soon after. Lying down exacerbates acid backup, reports the Mayo Clinic, which is one of the disadvantages of eating fruits at night for some people. </p>
<p> Fruits After Food </p>
<p> The most important thing diet-wise when it comes to eating fresh fruit (and vegetables) is to have several servings a day. Fruits provide fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are crucial for good health. Dietary fiber not only normalizes digestion and prevents diseases of the colon, but it also increases the satiety factor of your meal without increasing the calorie count. </p>
<p> Dietary fiber swells when it comes into contact with fluids in your digestive system, which causes gastric distension. Besides making you feel full, this sends signals to your brain that inhibit the release of an appetite-stimulating hormone called ghrelin, according to a research review in the Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism in January 2019. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Fiber also helps control blood sugar. Although fruit can be high in natural sugars, the fiber packaged along with it helps to slow sugar's absorption into your bloodstream, preventing blood sugar spikes. You can't say that about a piece of chocolate cake. </p>
<p> Chocolate cake also doesn't contain the volume of vitamins and minerals found in fruits. Citrus foods are a rich source of vitamin C, which you need to build collagen, the protein that provides your body's structure and aids wound healing. Watermelon, mango, cantaloupe and grapefruit are good sources of vitamin A, which supports the health of your skin and eyes. Kiwis, cherries and tomatoes are rich in potassium, an electrolyte mineral that helps regulate blood pressure. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Finally, all fruits, but especially red and purple fruits such as blueberries, raspberries and blackberries, contain plant chemicals with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. "Oxidants" or free radicals, are unpaired electrons formed both by natural physiological processes and by exposure to environmental contaminants. Oxidants can attack healthy cells and cause diseases, such as cancer. As the name implies, antioxidants can help neutralize free radicals and prevent cell damage. </p>
<p> Eating Fruit After a Meal </p>
<p> Fruit makes for an almost guilt-free post-meal treat, as long as you consume it in moderation. Although bananas are nutritious, they are also high in sugar and calories relative to some other fruits, according to USDA data. </p>
<p> Eating too many bananas could increase your calorie intake and potentially lead to weight gain if your intake exceeds your calorie expenditure. However, to be fair, bananas are a lot less likely to cause problems than a Boston cream pie. </p>
<p> Think fruit could never take the place of your favorite sweet treat? Give it a chance. Your sweet tooth may be conditioned to the unnatural sweetness of your favorite sugary desserts. But if you allow some time, your tastebuds can become more sensitive to fruit's natural sweetness. </p>
<p> While a whole apple or a cup of berries can be delicious on their own, you can combine them with other foods that can make them feel like more of a treat. For example, make a parfait with plain low-fat Greek yogurt, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries. Sprinkle some granola or dark chocolate shavings over top and enjoy. </p>
<p> You can also make frozen fruit "ice cream." Blend some already frozen banana chunks and frozen berries in your blender until smooth and scoop into a bowl. Top with coconut, crushed nuts or dark chocolate shavings. </p>

<p> Did man eat meat before the Fall and the Flood? </p>
<p> Question </p>
<p> Did man eat meat before the Fall and the Flood? </p>
<p> Answer </p>
<p> The Bible does not specifically answer this question. However, let's briefly examine some of the arguments. The first argument assumes there was no death at all before the Fall. From this follows that man could not have eaten animals, since animals could not die. </p>
<p> So was there death before the Fall of man? Yes there was. God is the One who ordained the cycle of the "seed." Genesis 1:11-12 state: </p>
<p> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. </p>
<p> In the process of sprouting, a seed must sacrifice itself, or "die," in order to grow and become a plant. Jesus himself spoke on this very point saying, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" (John 12:24; 1 Cor 15:36). In addition, since Adam and Eve ate plants then the plants necessarily died when they were eaten. Clearly, there was death in the world prior to the Fall. </p>
<p> The giant pacific octopus mates and then dies. Squids die shortly after giving birth. After spawning North Pacific Salmon die. Mayflies only live to procreate and then die. Praying mantis' have a rather violate mating pattern; the female literally bites off the head of the male; sexual cannibalism. Female ticks die after laying their eggs. Eels die after spawning. Certain spiders, moths, and frogs die after giving birth as well. So, there was death before the Fall. </p>
<p> God set-up these cycles of life from the very beginning and said that they were not only "good" (Gen 1:12, 21), but "very good" (Gen 1:31). Death for animals and plants before the Fall was not a bad thing; just the natural process God himself ordained. So, while man did not die before the Fall (Gen 2:17; Rom 3:23; 5:12-19), this does not mean that animals and plants did not die before the Fall. While man's sin ultimately affected the entire Creation (Rom 8:19-22), this does not mean that death did not exist prior to the Fall for plants or animals. </p>
<p> We have established that there was the death of at least some plants and animals before the Fall. What about after the Fall? </p>
<p> After the Fall, God himself sacrificed an animal (Gen 3:21; cf. 1 Pet 1:19-20; Rev 13:8). God shed blood (Lev 17:11; Heb 9:22). This was a sacrifice typifying the grace of God in salvation (Eph 2:8-10). God not only supplied the sacrifice (Gen 3:21: cf. Gen 22:8, 13), but the application of it too; Adam and Eve did not clothe themselves with the skins, but rather God clothed them (man is not saved by his own fig-leaf type works, Gen 3:7). </p>
<p> God's sacrifice in the Garden, at the very least then reveals the legitimacy of animal sacrifice for human benefit. Abel, a keeper of sheep, understood how to make an acceptable sacrifice using animals (Gen 4:3-4). Why was Abel a keeper of sheep? For what purpose? Perhaps to eat? Moreover, the description of Abel's sacrifice is instructive. Notice the phrase, "and of their fat portions" (Gen 4:4). This is similar to the peace offerings offered later where the "fat" was burned and the meat was eaten (Lev 3:9). Cain offered a grain offering. Later in the Old Testament we learn that grain offerings were accompanied by peace offerings (Lev. 3; 6:14-23). So, in Genesis 4 we may be observing the first coupling of peace and grain offerings. If so, then part of the offering may have been eaten by man. </p>
<p> Jabal, was the father of those who had livestock (Gen 4:20). Were any of these animals used in sacrifices? Were they used for meals? The Bible does not say. Noah received a special command by God to take 7 pairs of each clean animal upon the Ark (Gen 7:2-3). Clean animals were used for sacrifices. After the flood Noah offered an acceptable sacrifice to God (Gen 8:20-21). How did Noah know how to make an acceptable sacrifice? Did he just continue the practice from Abel? (Gen 4:3-4). Clearly, there was at least two animal sacrifices after the Fall and before the Flood; and probably several others. </p>
<p> It is important to note that many animal sacrifices in the Old Testament were often accompanied by a meal; God's portion was offered upon the altar and the worshipper's portion was consumed in a meal. Some covenants were confirmed with sacrifices, followed by meals (Gen 26:28-31; 31:54; Exod 24:3-11). Peace offerings (compare Abel's sacrifice, Gen 4:3-4) involved community meals (Lev 7:11-38; Deut 12:6-7; 27:7, etc.). Such meals and sacrifices were held at important points in Israel's history (Deut 27:7; 1 Chron 16:1-3; 2 Chron 7:1-10, etc.). And Paul compares the Lord's Supper to these sacrificial meals (1 Cor 10:16-21). Though the Mosaic Law was not officially given until Moses (Rom 5:13-14) and the Bible is silent on the issue, the fact that peace offering accompanied with meals remains a very real possibility in the society prior to Noah (Rom 2:14-15). </p>
<p> Some argue that Adam was given specific instructions in the Garden to only eat vegetation and not meat. They quote: </p>
<p> Genesis 1:29-30 And God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on. </p>
<p> Does this affirm that Adam and Eve were merely vegetarians? Not necessarily. The text only states the positive command that man could eat vegetation; it does not explicitly forbid the eating of meat. So, while the text does dictate that man may eat vegetation it does not outlaw the eating of meat. Rather than establishing a diet for the Garden, with the repeated use of "every," Genesis 1:29-30 may just be laying the groundwork for God's command not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen 2:16-17). </p>
<p> Others continue the argument and state that the first animals were eaten in obedience to Genesis 9:1-4. The text says: </p>
<p> And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything. But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood. </p>
<p> Genesis 9:1-3 is a re-issuing of the original lordship command given to Adam; even the "blessing" to "be fruitful and and multiply" (Gen 9:1, 7) is divinely similar to Genesis 1:28. The 'beasts of the earth, birds of the heaven, and fish of the sea' of Genesis 9:1-3 are all mentioned in Genesis 1:20-26, 28-30. So, we witness a re-creation or a renewal in Genesis 9:1-3. As John Gill wrote: </p>
<p> This is a renewal, at least in part, of the grant of dominion to Adam over all the creatures; these obeyed him cheerfully, and from love, but sinning, he in a good measure lost his power over them, they rebelled against him; but now though the charter of power over them is renewed, they do not serve man freely, but are in dread of him, and flee from him. </p>
<p> So, as Genesis 9:1-3 is not speaking of a brand new creation, but rather a renewal, so is it not necessarily speaking of a new command that man can eat animals, whom he already had full dominion over (Gen 1:26; 2:20). So, Genesis 9:1-3 is not necessarily a new permission to eat meat; especially seeing that meals involving the eating of meat may have accompanied earlier sacrifices after the Fall. However, there was definitely a new prohibition not to eat meat mingled with blood (Gen 9:4). </p>
<p> So, Genesis 9:1-3 refers to re-Creation. God adds the command not to eat meat with blood (Gen 9:4), Why? Because life is in the blood (Lev 17:11; cf. Gen 9:5-6). This reinforces the message implicit in all sacrifices; that redemption from sin would be "with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot" (1 Pet 1:19-20; Gen 3:15; 21; John 1:29; Rom 3:25: 1 Cor 5:7; 1 Pet 1:2). </p>
<p> Lastly, we need to take into account the depravity of man. Genesis 6:5-7 states: </p>
<p> The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the Lord said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them." </p>
<p> The depravity of man was very great. It was so great that God destroyed the world, except for Noah and the others with him on the Ark. It is difficult, if not impossible, to believe that no one would have thought of killing and eating animals for some 2300 years (app.) before the Flood; especially seeing animals were already being used in sacrifices. However, this is an argument from silence, so not conclusive. </p>
<p> So, there is no absolute evidence one way or the other whether man did or did not eat meat before the Flood; however more than likely he did. We do know however that Old Testament dietary laws are no longer in effect (Rom 10:4; 14:1-4; Gal 3:23-25; Eph 2:15). </p>

<p> Ciprofloxacin, also known as Cipro, is a powerful antibiotic drug that is used to treat dangerous bacterial infections. Ciprofloxacin is best known for its intended use to treat anthrax infections from a bioterror attack. However, ciprofloxacin is also used for other types of infections including those of the skin, bone and urinary tract. When taking ciprofloxacin, you will want to be mindful of what you eat and drink as there may be harmful consequences when some are mixed with this drug. </p>
<p> Caffeinated Foods and Beverages </p>
<p> You should avoid caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea, soft drinks and energy drinks when taking ciprofloxacin. Additionally, you should avoid caffeinated foods like those containing chocolate. According to Medline Plus, the stimulatory effects of caffeine may be exacerbated by ciprofloxacin, which can increase restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, heart arrhythmias and anxiety. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Alcoholic Beverages </p>
<p> You may want to avoid alcoholic beverages while taking ciprofloxacin for a bacterial infection. While you are not required to completely abstain from alcohol, the side effects of ciprofloxacin may increase the effects of alcohol consumption. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, you should avoid alcoholic beverages if taking ciprofloxacin makes you dizzy. </p>
<p> Dairy and Calcium-Fortified Foods </p>
<p> When you take ciprofloxacin, you will not want to take it at the same time that you are digesting foods that are high in calcium, a list that includes dairy products and calcium-fortified foods. According to Drugs.com, calcium disrupts the intestinal absorption of ciprofloxacin, which then diminishes the antibacterial effects of the drug. As a rule of thumb, you should not consume calcium-rich foods for two to six hours before you take ciprofloxacin. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Minerals and Multivitamins </p>
<p> Ciprofloxacin may also negatively interact with other nutritional items like minerals and multivitamins. According to Drugs.com, food and vitamin preparations that contain significant levels of zinc, magnesium, aluminum and iron should be avoided prior to taking ciprofloxacin. Similar to the effects of calcium, these minerals block the absorption of the drug into the body and reduce its antimicrobial effects. Do not take these types of vitamins or mineral-enriched foods for two to six hours prior to taking ciprofloxacin. If you need to take ciprofloxacin, tell your doctor about any medications and nutritional supplements you take. </p>

<p> Juicing is not an all-or-nothing diet approach. You can choose to add juice along with solid food, replace a single meal or go all-out and consume only juice for days or weeks. </p>
<p> Increase Fruit and Vegetable Intake </p>
<p> The USDA MyPlate guidelines recommend adults eat a minimum of 2 1/2 to 3 cups of vegetables and 1 1/2 to 2 cups of fruits per day. Only 1 in 10 Americans meets this recommendation daily, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>
<p> A meta-analysis published in the BMJ in September 2014 showed that a diet high in fruit and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of premature death, particularly when it comes to cardiovascular disease. </p>
<p> Of course juicing removes the pulp and rind — meaning the fiber — from fruits and vegetables, so consuming juice instead of whole produce may have different effects. Fiber is an important dietary component that helps regulate your digestive tract and positively affects your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. </p>
<p> A review published in the March 2017 issue of the International Journal of Molecular Science concluded that fruit and vegetable juices contain polyphenols and vitamins that still offer great benefit even without the fiber. </p>
<p> The researchers explained that fruit vegetable and juices have antioxidant effects, anti-inflammatory effects and cholesterol-lowering effects. Juicing, especially when you include a variety of fruits and vegetables, can improve the function of your cardiovascular system. </p>
<p> Juicing is also a convenient and efficient way to use leftover produce and save a little money on groceries. </p>
<p> About a Juicing Diet </p>
<p> A juicing diet isn't a set plan. Some may follow a juice cleanse or juice detox plan, during which they drink only juice for several days or even months in an attempt to reverse chronic disease, rid the body of toxins and jump-start weight loss. In a detox or cleanse, you generally consume no other food. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Juicing can also involve supplementing a regular diet with juices. You might have juice for only one meal, and then eat a normal, balanced meal at others. Or, you might just have a glass of freshly pressed juice alongside each healthy meal. In general, you're still mindful of eating healthy, whole foods while on a juice-supplemented diet. Often, you also eliminate foods considered potentially inflammatory, such as gluten. </p>
<p> Whatever juicing diet you follow, the intent is to boost your health and eliminate excess waste. Your body naturally produces toxins during metabolism such as urea, lactic acid and waste products, explains the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. You also build up toxins from things outside your body in the foods you eat, beverages you consume, pollution you breathe and substances you absorb through your skin. </p>
<p> A juice detox claims to help you become more efficient at processing natural toxins and at eliminating those you've unknowingly been exposed to in your environment. Some juicing diets include supplements or laxatives to help your body along; whether these supplements are necessary, or safe, is up for debate. </p>
<p> Does a Juice Cleanse Work? </p>
<p> The theory behind detoxing is that toxins can be potentially dangerous to human health. Your ability to detoxify efficiently depends on your environment, lifestyle, diet, health and genetics. If toxins build up and you're not efficient at eliminating them, they may be stored in fat cells, soft tissue and bone. </p>
<p> Not a lot of research has been done on the effectiveness of juice cleanses or detox diets in general. Many dieticians and other health experts proclaim that a juice detox plan isn't really necessary as your body has built-in detoxifying abilities. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health notes that severely restricting calories in a diet (such as a juice fast) doesn't usually lead to lasting weight loss and can leave you deficient in nutrients and calories. </p>
<p> These concerns may or may not be true, depending on the plan you follow. Plus a short-term juicing diet may actually do your body good, as long as it's included in a nutritious, well-rounded eating plan. </p>
<p> Research published in Scientific Reports in May 2017 showed that a three-day juicing diet changed the gut microbiota for the better in 20 subjects. The people drank only fruit/vegetable juices for three days and then followed their customary diet for 14 days. The researchers observed a significant decrease in weight by day 4 (that persisted through day 17) and determined that the juicing created changes in gut microbes so they were more favorable to weight loss. </p>
<p> An earlier study in Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift published in May 2015 reported that problems with the gut microbiota plays a role in obesity. The subjects in this research study fasted for one week and experienced a positive improvement in their gut that was more amenable to weight loss. </p>
<p> Doing a Juicing Diet </p>
<p> Juicing involves consuming juice from a variety of fruits and vegetables. Commercially sold juice detoxes are even available if you don't want to go through the hassle of juicing yourself. If you go on such a fast for more than a day or two, check with your doctor to make sure it won't aggravate an existing condition. </p>
<p> If you have diabetes, for example, it's important that you carefully follow a medically recommended plan and not overeat sugar, which can happen on a juicing diet. Drinking a lot of juice can be dangerous to people who have kidney disease, too, explains the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Some juices are high in a compound known as oxalate, which can worsen kidney problems. </p>
<p> Also, fully vet where your juices come from if you don't press and drink your own. Juices that haven't been pasteurized may contain harmful bacteria that can cause sickness, especially in children and the elderly and in those with weakened immune systems. </p>
<p> If you follow a juice-supplemented diet, you'll likely remove all highly processed foods from your diet, explains the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Foods to which many people are sensitive, such as gluten, dairy, eggs, peanuts and red meat, are also generally removed. Your detox diet includes lots of whole, nonglutenous grains (quinoa, rice), raw nuts and seeds and, sometimes, lean proteins such as wild-caught fish and organic chicken. </p>

<p> Potassium is an essential mineral that your cells require to function. However, it's possible for you to have too much potassium in your blood. High potassium treatment often involves dietary changes to prevent your levels from getting any higher. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> A low-potassium diet menu involves restricting your consumption of food products that are high in potassium. The strictness of the diet will be based on the severity of your high blood potassium and your health care practitioner's recommendations. </p>
<p> Potassium is important, as it helps your body's cells, nervous system and cardiovascular system work properly. According to the American Kidney Fund, potassium also helps your body's muscles function, including the muscles around your heart and respiratory system. This nutrient can also affect your blood pressure and metabolism. </p>
<p> The FDA considers potassium to be a nutrient of concern because most Americans don't consume enough potassium each day. However, it's also possible to consume too much potassium. High blood potassium, also known as hyperkalemia, can be dangerous for your health. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Causes of High Blood Potassium </p>
<p> According to the Mayo Clinic, normal blood potassium levels are around 3.6 to 5.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). High blood potassium levels are considered to be levels higher than 6 mmol/L. </p>
<p> If you've recently been diagnosed with hyperkalemia, your blood has more potassium in it than it should. When you consume foods with potassium, any excess potassium that your body doesn't need is removed by your kidneys and excreted through your urine. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When people are diagnosed with hyperkalemia, it usually means their kidneys aren't functioning properly, as their bodies aren't excreting enough potassium. Hyperkalemia can also occur for other reasons though. </p>
<p> High blood potassium can also be caused by Addison disease, hemolytic anemia, poorly controlled diabetes, or if you have recently had a serious injury. Hyperkalemia can also be caused by certain blood pressure lowering drugs and supplements. It can even occur if you consume a diet that's very high in potassium or are dehydrated. </p>
<p> Treating High Blood Potassium </p>
<p> Hyperkalemia often has no symptoms. However, common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, muscle fatigue and difficulty breathing. </p>
<p> You should always consult a doctor if you suspect you have hyperkalemia and are experiencing any of these symptoms. Hyperkalemia can be dangerous and life-threatening if left untreated. </p>
<p> Your doctor will tell you the cause of your high blood potassium and if it's serious enough to require urgent treatment. If your hyperkalemia is due to a specific medicine or supplement, your high potassium treatment may simply involve changing or stopping that medication. </p>
<p> People at risk for high blood potassium are frequently advised to make dietary changes to prevent this issue from occurring again. You'll often want to consult a dietitian or other health care professional to create a healthy low-potassium diet menu that's suited to your needs. Reducing your potassium intake can help prevent and treat high blood potassium levels. </p>
<p> Following a Low-Potassium Diet </p>
<p> In order to follow a low-potassium diet menu, you'll need to be aware of the variety of high-potassium foods you need to avoid. High-potassium foods to avoid with kidney disease and other conditions that may increase your risk for hyperkalemia include: </p>
<p> Be careful about consuming foods made with these ingredients, like fruit and vegetable juices, smoothies, sauces and soups. Certain baked goods and desserts may also be surprisingly rich in potassium, especially when they've been made with whole grains. Finally, be sure to avoid foods with salt substitutes, which can also contribute to increasing your potassium levels. </p>
<p> Healthy Low-Potassium Diet Menus </p>
<p> Low-potassium diet menus limit a lot of foods that would otherwise be considered healthy. Fortunately, there are still many fruits, vegetables and other foods you can consume that are suitable for a low-potassium diet. </p>
<p> Grain-based products like noodles, pasta, bread and rice (refined, not whole grain) </p>
<p> Make sure you keep an eye on your portions. Most foods have some amount of potassium. </p>
<p> A small amount of a high-potassium food is unlikely to harm you. However, this also means that eating large amounts of low-potassium foods can result in the consumption of too much potassium. </p>
<p> Consuming Healthy Amounts of Potassium </p>
<p> Potassium is still an essential mineral. This means that even low-potassium diet menus have to allow you to eat some amount of potassium. </p>
<p> The exact amount of potassium you can consume if you have hyperkalemia is up to your health care practitioners. The National Kidney Foundation says that most potassium restricted diets allow you to consume around 2,000 milligrams of potassium each day. </p>
<p> According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, depending on the strictness of your low-potassium diet, you may need to limit your intake of high-potassium foods or avoid them altogether. If you're allowed to limit your intake, you may be able to integrate these foods into your diet for some meals but not others. </p>
<p> The American Kidney Fund recommends calculating each meal's potassium intake. For instance, you might be planning to have lunch at a restaurant and suspect that your meal will be high in potassium. This might be okay for certain low-potassium diets, as long as you make sure to avoid potassium-rich foods at both breakfast and dinner. </p>
<p> There are also strategies you can follow to try to maintain a balanced diet while still limiting your potassium. When eating at home, always try to cook with fresh or frozen foods rather than canned goods. If you do consume canned foods, make sure that you don't use the liquid, as a substantial amount of potassium is found in it. </p>
<p> When cooking recipes with vegetables that are high in potassium, you can also leach the potassium from the ingredient before integrating it into your meal. The National Kidney Foundation says that this works well for squash and root vegetables like potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots and beets. </p>
<p> To leach potassium from a vegetable, you need to peel it, rinse it and soak it for at least two hours in warm water. You should use a 10-to-1 ratio of water to vegetables when soaking. Once you're done, rinse your vegetable and cook it in water. You'll need to use a 5-to-1 ratio of water to vegetables. </p>

<p> How to Reduce Stomach Gas After Eating </p>
<p> ABOUT THE AUTHOR </p>

<p> Gas in the stomach is typically caused by swallowing air while eating and by the breakdown of food in the large intestine. Certain foods such as beans, pears, broccoli, mushrooms, milk, whole grains and apples can contribute to gas. Common gas symptoms include flatulence, burping, bloating and abdominal pain and discomfort. Because gas can be severe and debilitating, it's essential to understand how to get rid of it after eating. </p>
<p> Step 1 </p>
<p> Sit up straight after you eat to decrease abdominal pressure and help ease bloating and gas. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Step 2 </p>
<p> Walk around after eating. Moving helps with digestion and can reduce the gas and bloating that occurs after mealtime. </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Drink a strong cup of peppermint tea immediately following your meal. Peppermint helps relax the muscles of the digestive system, which allows painful gas to pass easier. </p>
<p> Step 4 </p>
<p> Eat a food with probiotics in it such as yogurt, miso soup or kefir. Probiotics are natural bacteria that help to reduce gas. You can also find probiotics in supplement form. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Step 5 </p>
<p> Take a digestive enzyme supplement, which helps your body digest and break down food more thoroughly. </p>
<p> Step 6 </p>
<p> Pop an over-the-counter medication designed to help reduce gas such as alpha- galactosidase or simethicone. Lactose drops and tablets can also help gas related to lactose intolerance. </p>
<p> Things You'll Need </p>
<p> Peppermint tea </p>
<p> Probiotic-rich foods such as yogurt or kefir </p>
<p> Digestive enzyme supplements </p>
<p> Over-the-counter gas medication </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> Prevent future episodes of painful stomach gas by chewing your food thoroughly before you swallow it. Chewing well breaks food down into smaller particles that are easier for your body to digest. </p>
<p> Warning </p>
<p> See your doctor if gas symptoms worsen or are accompanied by vomiting, weight loss or diarrhea. These could be signs of a more serious medical condition such as irritable bowel syndrome. </p>

<p> 5 Signs You’re Eating Too Much Fruit </p>
<p> Am I cruel to write this? Maybe. But it has to be written. </p>
<p> I realize it’s the middle of summer and just about every fruit worth eating is in season. Peaches are perfectly ripe, apricots are plump, and berries are bursting with flavor. </p>
<p> Even if you’re not a year round fruit-i-vore, summer makes you want to be one. </p>
<p> In every client nutrition session, I hear about what people eat. At minimum, I have them recall what they’ve eaten in the past 24 hours. At most, I have 2 weeks of written record. </p>
<p> And one thing I see people overdoing time and time again is fruit. Especially in summer. </p>
<p> But, but, but… </p>
<p> “Fruit is healthy” </p>
<p> “Fruit is the perfect snack” </p>
<p> “Fruit has vitamin C and antioxidants” </p>
<p> Yes, yes, these things are true…-ish. It seems the past few decades of government sponsored nutrition messages to eat 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day have been lost in a game of telephone. Somewhere along the way, people forgot that vegetables were part of that sentence and many people took it as an excuse to go way overboard on fruits in the name of health. </p>
<p> But that “healthy habit” might not be doing you any favors. </p>
<p> Here Are 5 Signs You’re Eating Too Much Fruit </p>
<p> 1. You’re Frequently Bloated </p>
<p> Fruit is a classic trigger for bloating and here’s why. Fruit is rich in a type of sugar called fructose. Unfortunately, many of us are not well equipped to digest and absorb large amounts of fructose. Researchers believe up to 40% of people suffer from a condition called fructose malabsorption in which fructose is inefficiently absorbed across the small intestine. So instead of nourishing us, sometimes fruit sits in the gut and ferments with the help of bacteria. And the result of those bacteria feasting on fructose is a lot of gas and bloating that makes us feel pretty icky. </p>
<p> Now, glucose (also present in fruit) does help facilitate absorption of fructose, which many use as an argument to suggest fruit is fine and only refined fructose is an issue. But, that’s only true to a certain extent. Most fruits have been bred to be larger and contain more fructose than their great grand parents (the original apple was about as large and sweet as a crab apple), so you can understand how the human body might not have the skills to handle it. If hefty portions of fruit leave your tummy in knots, chances are you have some level of fructose malabsorption and you probably should lay off the fruit. </p>
<p> “The most important carbohydrates that routinely cause clinical abdominal complaints are lactose, fructose, and the sugar alcohol sorbitol. Lactose has long been recognized as one of the most important nutrients, and fructose and sorbitol have become increasingly important following recommendations to increase fruit and vegetable consumption” – World J Gastroenterol. 2007. </p>
<p> Side note – In addition to fructose malabsorption, you can also have an inflammatory reaction to fructose. I tested reactive to fructose via the Mediator Release Test, which measures chemical and food sensitivities, so I have to be doubly careful with the amount of fruit I eat! </p>
<p> 2. You Have Diarrhea or IBS </p>
<p> Along with the fructose absorption issues I described above, which does commonly lead to diarrhea, let me explain another possibility for why fruit messes up your digestion. Fruits are designed by nature to carry seeds and make a new plant, so when you think about it, it’s in their best interest to not be fully digested by humans. The plant is hoping that some of its seeds will survive transit and get, shall I say, “deposited” in a new location to grow a new fruit tree/plant. (I should have taken a photo of the massive bear poop from a recent Alaskan hike through berry-filled bear country, but you’ll have to take my word for it. It was solid berry seeds! And, no, I did not see a bear…. this time…) </p>
<p> “The clinical symptoms of carbohydrate malabsorption [including fructose malabsorption] include flatulence, abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhea, and sometimes even headache, usually after the ingestion of a product containing the incompletely absorbed sugar.” – World J Gastroenterol. 2007. </p>
<p> Many fruits (like apples) are also rich in pectin, a type of fiber that folks with IBS may have trouble fully breaking down. If you have IBS, it’s possible that an apple a day will NOT keep the doctor away. </p>
<p> “Faecal bacteria of IBS patients showed the lowest ability to degrade pectin.” – Acta Vet Brno. 2002. </p>
<p> 3. You Can’t Lose Weight </p>
<p> You’ve already switched to a real food diet, you’ve cut out soda, candy, processed foods, etc… but there’s one problem: you’re still not losing weight. If you’re still battling the scale after adopting healthier habits, you might consider looking at your fruit intake. </p>
<p> I agree that fruit is a healthier alternative to many desserts and junk foods, but if fruit is a staple item at every meal and snack, you may simply be eating too many carbohydrates to allow your body to lose weight. In brief, any time we eat carbohydrates our blood sugar goes up. That triggers our body to release insulin to lower the blood sugar. How does it do that? By converting it to fat for storage! </p>
<p> It’s unfair to single out fruit, but if you’ve already overhauled your diet, this could be the stone left unturned. We’re quick to blame bread and sweets for our weight, but when you realize that a banana packs the same number of carbs as 2 slices of bread and more than some candy bars, you might have a different perspective. Also, be sure to read #4 and #5! </p>
<p> 4. You Always Crave Sugar </p>
<p> Not only does eating fruit spike your blood sugar, as explained above, it also doesn’t sustain it for very long. If you have fruit by itself as a snack, you might notice that you’re satisfied for 30 minutes or so, but soon after your tummy starts growling. That’s because fruit doesn’t come packaged with much protein or fat to keep us sated. Yes, it has fiber, which helps a bit, but it’s not enough to prevent a crash in blood sugar after eating fruit. </p>
<p> What happens when our blood sugar tanks? We get hungry and we get cravings. </p>
<p> For what? For foods that will raise the blood sugar quickly; anything sweet or starchy. (I’m having de-ja-vu) </p>
<p> Aside from the blood sugar-hunger connection, the fructose in fruits has another seldom-discussed effect. Fructose does not trigger the release of leptin, a hormone that signals satiety, and instead triggers the release of ghrelin, a hunger stimulating hormone. No wonder eating fruit makes you want to eat more fruit! </p>
<p> So, do your body a favor and eat that apple with some peanut butter, those blueberries with some full-fat Greek yogurt (or homemade, unsweetened whipped cream!), and that peach with a handful of almonds. The fat and protein from those additions will help dampen the effects of fructose and you’ll be surprised what a difference it makes. This sort of food combining is especially helpful at breakfast. </p>
<p> 5. You Love Smoothies and Juice </p>
<p> I’m already bracing for the hate mail, but again, this has to be said. Yes, your green juice is better than most drinks, but if it contains fruit, it’s likely packed with sugar. </p>
<p> When fruit is juiced and you remove the fiber, the remaining sugar is absorbed quite rapidly into your bloodstream leading to what I described in #3 and #4. A 12oz cup of fruit juice, even freshly squeezed organic OJ, has the same amount of sugar as a can of soda. Now the classic rebuttal is to just make a smoothie, and while I do believe this is a better option, I still don’t think it’s ideal. </p>
<p> Even when you chew fruit very well, it’s still not broken down as finely as when your Vitamix gets to work. By mechanically breaking up the cellular structure of fiber, our body has more immediate access to the sugars contained in the smoothie. So even though you didn’t take out the fiber like you would when juicing, you did impact the rate at which your body will absorb the sugar in your smoothie. And not in a good way. </p>
<p> Plus, when fruit is in a liquid form, we can eat a whole lot more of it. A 4oz glass of juice has the sugar of 1 apple, but that sure doesn’t feel like a full serving! </p>
<p> You might stop at 1 or 2 apples if you’re munching on them fresh, but 2 apples worth of juice is just a few gulps. </p>
<p> If you believe you should join Smoothie-aholics Anonymous and can’t go without your fix, you might try making your smoothie with a reasonable portion of low-sugar fruits, like berries, and combine it with nuts, coconut milk, and chia seeds to lessen the impact on your blood sugar. If green juice is your thing, juice only non-starchy vegetables. </p>
<p> So, now that all the fruit-lovers have mysteriously vanished from my life, you may be asking… </p>
<p> What’s a reasonable amount of fruit to eat in a day? </p>
<p> In general – and unless you’re following a very low carbohydrate diet – I suggest 2 portions of fruit daily, preferably in its fresh and whole form. If you really want bonus points, make one (or both) of those portions berries. </p>
<p> If you are very physically active, at a healthy weight, and/or thrive on a higher carbohydrate diet, by all means, eat more! I don’t pretend to create set-in-stone “rules” here. </p>
<p> How much is a portion? </p>
<p> A portion of fruit is defined as approximately a ½ cup (handful) or the size of a small apple. (Not half a watermelon or a jumbo bowl of fruit salad.) </p>
<p> Vegetables are far more nutrient-dense than fruits when it comes to vitamins and minerals. And the classic nutrients that people use to defend high consumption of fruit are readily available in low-carbohydrate vegetables. </p>
<p> Potassium is easily found in avocados, chard, mushrooms and kale, vitamin C in raw broccoli, bell peppers and tomatoes, and antioxidants are abundant in all vegetables, but especially the green and leafy variety. </p>
<p> I’m not saying don’t eat fruit. </p>
<p> I’m suggesting you be mindful of your portions, particularly if you identify with any of the 5 signs you’re eating too much fruit detailed above and opt for lower-sugar varieties when given the option. </p>
<p> Think of fruit like a dessert, not celery sticks. <– Tweet that! </p>
<p> Do your waistline and digestive system a favor and aim for a few servings of fruit per day, not 5-9. </p>

<p> Lily, this post really spoke to me. Even though I believe that there is no right way to eat for everyone (we are all different, after all), I’ve experienced with a lot of different types and quantities of foods and have now concluded that 1-3 servings of fruit per day is optimal for my body at this time. </p>
<p> As a kid, I loved to eat half a watermelon. And for some reason my mom always suggested I eat whole grain pumpernickel break with it (Russian tradition). Now I understand why – if I eat fruit with nothing else, I start to feel a little edgy and light-headed. So I usually eat some fruit, wait 5-10 minutes for eat to begin moving through digestion and right away follow up with some protein with veggies or protein carbs. You may look at me weird when at brunch I order an egg and veggie omelette with brown rice and a side of fruit and and eat my fruit first, chat with you for a bit and then eat the rest, but I know that my body will feel great before, during and after the meal if I do that. </p>
<p> We love green smoothies at our house and I usually add 1/3 banana, 1/3 c. berries, spinach/kale, a bit of coconut milk, chia seeds (or hemp seeds) and coconut oil (per serving) – yum!!!! The kids love helping me make them. If we wanna get fancy we’ll throw in raw cacao powder and add avocado to make them really creamy chocolate! </p>
<p> And I have to add that I love green juice with no fruit, instead using cucumbers and celery as a base, with greens (kale, chard, spinach, etc.) and lemon (for flavor). </p>
<p> So interesting, Lana! I have the same aversion to eating fruit in the middle or after a meal, especially a protein-containing meal. Turns out it alters the pH and enzyme environment of the stomach, making digesting a large amount of protein quite difficult. For those with fructose malabsorption or sensitivity, that digestive upset can be quite uncomfortable! That may explain why most of my clients do best having fruit as a snack instead. </p>
<p> Love your healthy smoothies and green juice! Cucumbers make a great base for green juice in place of fruit. </p>
<p> I eat raspberries, blueberries and blackberries around ten in the morning. 5-6 of each. I eat a combo of grapes, pineapple, and melon in mid afternoon…bought in a small container at an organic foods place etc. I don’t use sugar, just stevia once in a while. I am of good weight, but am concerned about sugar content. Yogurt and milk have sugar. I put two heaping tbsps of yogurt on my granola cereal along with milk. I am 86 and have no medical problems or prescriptions. I eat plenty of vegetables….but worry a little about the sugar factor. Thanks for listening. </p>
<p> Feelin’ great, no medical problems, and no prescriptions at 86? You’re doing amazing! </p>
<p> I admire your health very much. I always wanted that no prescription and no medical problem at the age of 86. I am 51 1/2years old and start perimenopause stages. It has been one year now , I eat lot of fruits in a day as 6 to 7 different kinds ( blueberries, figs ( in season), grapes , blackberry , pineapple, cantaloupe , persimmon or mango (depend for the season) , banana and avocado . Every morning I extract collard green , spinach , kale, beet, cucumbers , carrots, small piece ginger , and small raw turmeric, cilantro, apple . I extract 40 ounces of juice. I drink this juice every day even on vacation I packed and well preserve fruits and juice extract to have them daily for one year now. I do not eat pork , beef for a year now. But I eat chicken one a month. egg one a day. I can not drink milk or have yogurt. I never take any supplement of any kind. it made me sick and bloated. I go out to sun everyday ( when sunny day , one hour sun bath daily . I do have multiple fibroids in uterus and cysts in ovaries, I just found out last year. My doctor did not recommend to do any thing yet because they all still small size. I will probably stop period soon. The hope that after menopause they will shrink if fibroids and cysts still small. These are the reason that I changed my diet 80% raw fruits and vegetable juice extract all organically grown or raise (meat, eggs). But after I read this article , I think that I eat too much fruits and to big potion in a day for a year. I will probably change to good control potion and probably eat less fruits. I will have my physical check up soon so that I can see whether too many fruits could bring sugar problem for me or not. So far my sugar was very good number last year test, before I started a lot of fruit intake. Thank you very much for the article The Sign That You Eat too Much Fruits. I will take this advise for control portion of fruit into my daily diet. It is good article ! </p>
<p> Lana, your comment spoke out to me! I remember that one year, I decided to fast for Ramadan. I think it was in August and the rules were that I couldn’t eat or drink from sun-rise to sun-set. </p>
<p> Because I didn’t feel like eating but wanted something juicy, I always started with a piece of fruit (usually peach), then I would move on to my real starter – soup. Then I’d have my mains and another bit of fruit for dessert. </p>
<p> I never felt happier or healthier in my life. I had always imagined it was the fasting but your comment finally made me realise what made me feel that way! It was limiting myself to only eating fruit with meals and not over-doing the fruit! Thank you! </p>
<p> I know! My new doctor has sent me to an excellent nutritionist who, much to my amazement said “Fresh fruit organic or not, go light. I want you to concentrate on healthy proteins and go heavy on the greens”. </p>
<p> When I started the heart health diet I simply assumed that fruits in quantity were great – but guess what healthy proteins and a whole lotta leafy and green food did? I lost 23 pounds in 2 months, exercise every day with at least a two mile walk and am starting with a trainer this week at the gym. </p>
<p> My doctor casually told me the weight and when I squealed he said “This is not about losing weight, it’s about you not dying.” So of course I said “Yes, I know, but 23 POUNDS!!!” </p>
<p> By the way, I just turned 61. Happy birthday to me… </p>
<p> That’s fantastic, Donna. Congratulations! The best part about it is you’ve taken action and proven to yourself and your doctor that food and exercise does make a difference. </p>
<p> Greens are definitely something to “go heavy on”! Great advice. </p>
<p> *blink* So I guess it would’ve been helpful if I’d read this BEFORE purchasing the huge yellow watermelon that now sits in my fridge. </p>
<p> It just looks so refreshing on this 95-degree day! </p>
<p> Thanks for the information. Right on for me.;I hardly eat any fruit, but I decided to start eating right and bought a bunch of fruit and veggies. The first day (yesterday) I sat on the couch ate lots of grapes than later had an apple and then a protein bar for lunch. Avocado in a flour tortilla. Well my IBS has flare up with diarreah, bloaded and weakness. I had been constipated and now I can sit still for 5 minutes because the fountains of the deep keep flowing, it’s like a harsh cleanse!!! Again thanks for the information and education. When should I start eating fruit again? I’m scared! </p>
<p> You should look into the low-FODMAP diet. It’s done wonders for my IBS. Among the things you mentioned, wheat, avocado, and apples are problematic. Wheat is high in fructans, avocados in moderation are fine (moderate polyol). Apples are high in polyols, so I avoid them. I live in NY state, and it’s really tough to not eat one of the only things I can get fresh around here, but my digestive tract thanks me. </p>
<p> Oh, Lily. You’ve got my number. I AM eating too much fruit. And you touched on why – I’ve recently started eating pretty clean and fruit feels like a “treat” that I can have. As often as I want. And guess what? My weight loss has stalled out … interesting. I love that you provided guidelines for how much is acceptable, and I think I will try some of those protein/fat combos to give my snacks more heft. But can I be sad for a minute? I heart fruit! </p>
<p> Interesting observation about your weight loss, Beth! Fear not, I don’t suggest you break up with fruit completely, just fine tune the types/amount a bit. 🙂 </p>
<p> I am very think all my life. 72 years young walk 2 to 4 miles a day. Ear only fruit veggies nuts seeds. I love fruit do not like beg make myself eatveg. Only protein I get is in greens and nuts and seeds. Been veg for 42 years. Have a lot of candida problems. Fruit makes me nervous but happy. I was told by a physic to not eat any fruit or grains. She said I can not digest them. So been on fruit veggies nuts and seeds for dome time can’t digest beans or soy. Have to eat every 2 he’s. Blood sugar drops from many allergies. If I go off fruit I loose too much weight and am tired. Any suggestions. I put fruit with nuts or seed or avacado .. Thanks for your help. Ann crystal </p>
<p> Hell everybody my name is Inna and am frutoholic and nuttoholic ((((( Last night scoffed 300g of blueberries and 300 g of strawberries and on the top of that 150 u of Brasil nuts (((( All this morning am not leaving my toilet ((( I know its time to stop but or cut dawn but I CA NOT MANAGE THAT (((( little snack packs of nuts and fruit is very expensive so i buy big ones and eat it at once ((( am 55 by the way …… thank you for reading </p>
<p> Inna – go easy on the Brasil nuts. They are delicious, I know, but just THREE of them cover the daily recommended dose of selenium. Too much selenium cannot be a good thing, no more than a deficiency would be. </p>
<p> I used to be addicted to fruit! And it felt like blasphemy when I first learned they were not that good for my health. Now I’m pretty used to eating more veggies instead, but it’s still soooooo difficult to reject a delicious pineapple or papaya when I’m in tropical places. </p>
<p> Tropical places always get me too, and that’s a great time to indulge a bit more. So great to hear you’ve embraced more veggies, Madeleine! </p>
<p> lol fruits “not that good for me” thats the funniest shit I’ve ever heard XD Ive seen plenty of young women worry about how much freaking fruit they’re eating because of articles like this, but then go and chow down on a burger with no thoughts. People enjoy the damn fruits, it grows from the earth. </p>
<p> Grows from the earth… so does deadly night shade & the dangerous herb monkshood . You need to use more reasoning in you reply. </p>
<p> Fruit is the most healing food on the planet. I eat a 75% fruit diet (counting tomatoes as a fruit) and 20% vegetables. I live in total euphoria. There is no way I could feel any better. People are so stopped up with fat and are not able to absorb good food correctly and it “disagrees “ with them. Lower the fats and keep introducing fruit particularly berries and melons. </p>
<p> I totally agree with you anonymous. I’m 44 years old, 5’9, and 141 lbs. I’m slim and toned because the majority of my daily food consumption has always been fruits, veggies, nuts, and beans. I’ve never dieted, and I don’t eat processed foods. </p>
<p> Eeek! I think I’m eating too much fruit! This really explains a LOT, I’m going to shoot for 1-2 servings a day and see if that helps with my weight loss goals. Thanks!!! </p>
<p> I’m exactly the same all I eat is fruit(strawberries,grapes,apples,oranges,mango,peaches,plums,kiwi)and was thinking it was good for me instead of snacking on chocolate and sweets.I have chronic constipation and an under active thyroid so I’ve been blaming that on my rapid weight gain when now after reading your post I think it’s actually the fruit that’s causing it,Won’t be eating fruit now but what else am I going to snack on? </p>
<p> Thank you so much for this fantastic article! I was one of those people – who ate crazy amounts of fruits because I thought it was healthy to do so. I was wrong – in which I’ve experienced each of the points you’ve mentioned! I’ve lowered my fruit intake to 2 per day and always wait few hours after I finish my meals especially if I have meat or chicken. Again, thank you for the great read! </p>
<p> I love how you listened to your body when it gave you the signs that you were having too much fruit. Your solution is rationale, healthy, and most of all, feels good for your body. Bravo, Sara! </p>
<p> Love it! I learned something today. I have to share this with my mama and husband. I am a fruit fanatic. However, it sounds like moderation is best with everything you intake. Definitely noted. Thanks for sharing Lily. 😀 </p>
<p> Whoa! This was super informative! I’ve been eating a real food diet for a few years now and never really thought about these tips. I did cut out any kind of juice in the morning finally because of the sugar content, so that really rings true with me. I will keep this in mind from now on, especially when trying to eat at least 50% raw! </p>
<p> Oh yes, fruit can easily become a staple on a raw foods diet unless you’re really careful and many people suffer the digestive consequences of too much fructose. Glad you found some pearls in here, Trista! </p>
<p> Wow i realy lean something today,befor i eat tomuch of fruit but now realizing tomuch of fruit is a problem to me i will change. </p>
<p> Wow, I never realized there was such a thing as eating TOO MUCH FRUIT! My “diets” in the past have consisted of eating mostly fruit… now I know to change that. Thanks for the insight! </p>
<p> Right Lauren?! Yeah the fruit-only diets can be a metabolism nightmare. All that sugar leads to high blood sugar and high insulin, both of which signal the body NOT to burn fat. </p>
<p> I highly suggest folks consider their adjusting their breakfast when attempting to lose weight or stabilize their energy. </p>
<p> Hi Lilly. I started reading your post thinking: “What? No way. Fruit is good for you. It’s not as caloric as a candy bar and even if you have a lot of it, it’s still healthier than having a stack of pancakes! Lilly is really out of line this time” I went on reading and quickly checking and scoffing at the list of items: “Nope, no bloating! No sensitivities. I digest it really well. Sorry. No problems at all after eating fruit.” When I was ready to declare my unconditional love for fruits and to declare that fruit and my body were a match made in heaven… I stopped cold at the “not loosing weight” suggestion. I ran to the bathroom, climbed on the scale and… there it was: no weight loss whatsoever. Nothing. After a whole week of heroically and completely avoiding all kinds of processed foods. No more pasta for me. So long cookies. Goodbye bread. A whole week of meat, fruits and vegetables. And some yogurt too. But still… no weight loss. Ok Lilly. You got me there. I hear you loud and clear. 2 apples a day from now on then. Well… let’s make it peaches. I like them a lot better. 🙂 . </p>
<p> I recommend doing some research on the glycemic index of foods. Candy bars have far more calories than fruit does, but some fruits like bananas and watermelons (and potatoes on the veggie side) will spike your blood sugar and insulin much faster and higher than chocolate will. This is also why berries are recommended. Their fiber content reduces their glycemic index lower than most friuits. Peaches are awesome, but variety and moderation are better. I hope that helps! </p>
<p> It’s the high fat yoghurt and meat that are preventing weight loss, not the fruit. Possibly also the salt in the meat causing water weight retention. </p>
<p> Oh and I forgot to add that fats and carbs together?? A HUGE NO NO!!! Too many fats prevent the absorption of carbs into your body’s cells. If you’re going to eat high carbs lower your fat intake and vice versa. Carbs for the win for energy and sustainable weight. </p>
<p> I enjoy eating oranges after meals and now I know that’s the cause of anxiety and belly bloating. Eating fruit compared to junk food helps a lot but I think to take it to the next level we need to keep the portions in check, like you have advised. </p>
<p> I eat way too much fruit! I follow Weight Watchers but I haven’t lost a signal lb all year despite following the rules strictly. My gut is constantly doing somersaults recently, it is NOT happy with me! On an average day at the moment I eat an apple (a pretty sizeable one), 6 or 7 strawberries, 2 bananas (pretty large ones, I love my bananas!) and a pretty sizeable bowl of grapes. I relate to so many points in this article, I’m going to give 2 pieces of fruit a day a go and see how I get on. I might have to snack on things that contain points but I’m not losing weight as it is so it can’t hurt to try </p>
<p> Hurray, I may have just found the answer. Same here and loving 4-5 serves a day…. Hmmm will have to ease up </p>
<p> I too am a weight watcher. Fruit is currently 0 points so i load my shopping cart each week and use it as filler. Way too much. I’m gassy and family complains about that. I also worry about too much fructose and overworking my pancreas. My weight has plateaued as well. Gonna try to cut down fruit and use more veggies and protein as filler. With me it’s all about feeling full. </p>
<p> wow this is very informative, maybe it helps my addictions of eating too much papaya, I love papaya since I was a kid, but since I have a two kids my weight increase so much and it’s double my size. But after 2 yrs my weight is reducing from 78 kilos to 52 with the help of my daily exercise routine. I run 4 kilometers 5 times a week. but I also eat too much papaya and drink lots of lemon. Now I think too much eating papaya can harm my liver because of papaya have large amount of fructose , since I read your article I feel that it’s time for me to reduce my papaya big bite habit. thns for sharing this wonderful content. </p>
<p> I too have been eating way too much fruit. I thought it was okay until I started listening to a friend who is dieting- (she isnt eating any fruit at all) she spoke about the carbs. I have had a bloated stomach and have not lost any weight even though I have stopped drinking wine as well. On an average day I will eat one pound of blueberries (yes I said one pound) or one pint of blueberries, one pint of rasberries, some grapes, some watermelon and not sure what else. I am going to cut down to 2 pieces of fruit a day and try for more veggies. Food for thought! </p>
<p> HI, I actually just started a whole foods diet and have been using fruit as a crutch the past 2 days to help me with my hunger and cravings between meals. I have been way bloated, gassy, and always pooping. I thought this was just a transition phase from processed foods to whole foods. Now, I think it’s because I’ve been consuming fruit like candy the past 2 days to fill myself up between meals so I don’t reach for something completely off track. I’ll try to keep it in check and eat more vegetables. Thanks. </p>
<p> I’m frequently bloated, always crave sugar and I LOVE smoothies and juice + I know I eat too much fruits because that’s basically what I eat whole day and my doctor told me to stop eat only fruits because I was only 55 pounds on the age of 16 So now i only eat fruits on breakfast. </p>
<p> Avocadoes and tomatoes are technically fruit but you listed them as alternatives. Any other fruits that should be counted as a vegetable? Also what about the fiber content? Is a fig or a prune a better option then say an apple? </p>
<p> Botanically speaking, a lot of foods we don’t think of as fruit are actually fruit (like the ones you mention, but also zucchini, peppers, cucumbers, etc.). For the purpose of this article, I am referring to the usual fruit – those that are sweet and therefore naturally high in sugar. Yes, fiber content helps lower the glycemic impact, which is one reason berries are so fantastic. </p>
<p> I have just started drinking veg and fruit filled smoothies instead of porridge for breakfast and wondered why I put on weight!!! Now I know. can you tell me which berries are good as in your article you sound a bit negative on blueberries or are they ok in with my leafy veg smoothie </p>
<p> Any type of berries would be a great addition to your veggie smoothie, blueberries included. 🙂 </p>
<p> Similar to most of the posts. I to thought I was doing the ‘right thing’ and eating copious amounts of fruit, all berries, primarily blueberries (love um) and strawberries (love these too). I exercise everyday, that is walking to/from work, and walking at lunchtime, and gyming for at least 1.5 hours 4 times a week, and yet.. I have piled on the pounds. After reading the information, I would definitely say the information is not cruely written, I am so glad I found it, I now have to reduce my fruit intake, it is the only explanation I have for the way I feel. Gassy and bloated (constantly). I am not going to remove my beloved blueberries completely just reduce the amount I eat in the morning to a handful and not 150g a day (yeah I know probably was too much). </p>
<p> It was very comforting to read your advice as I have definitely been consuming too much fruit, thinking it was the best way to lose weight. 2-3 pieces at lunch and two at dinner equal too many pieces. Can also relate to the feeling of bloating so I will revise my diet and put in more greens and monitor the results. The fruit was intended to help to stay ‘regular’, having had colon cancer. Thanks heaps for your comments and here’s hoping for some positive,results on the scales! </p>
<p> Hi thank u for this , I did actually ask someone the other day if u can overdose on fruit ! Iv recently had blood test back and have a foliate deficiency. My doctor said it was due to my diet. Iv started eating fruit and a lot of it. I use one of those bullet things and a normal smoothie consists of banana, apple, pear, kiwi, strawberrys , natural yoghurt , almond milk and porridge oats. Is this too much fruit ? I have been getting pains in my stomach. </p>
<p> I participated in a study where patients were required to eat 40+ servings of fruit a day. No adverse side effects from the study were found and people lost weight during the study. The only negative side effect was some bloating from eating some of the same fruits (such as only apples) to meet the requirements of the number of servings. I feel like this is come sense though… Unless this article was written by the CEO of Taco Bell </p>
<p> Hi, I’m mother of 4 children and after kids being last 2 months bringing from school one thing or the other I decided seriously be strict on their diet (Iactually never thought I fed kids with unhealthy foods as always cooked from scratch but seems like it wasn’t healthy enough =)))) and work on boosting their immune system. While my 3 older ones eat the most of fruit with no problem ( I always give them as a dessert after meals), I have my fussy youngest 3 year old who refuses to eat anything apart apples and bananas. So in order to be able to give him wider variety of fruit I started to make smoothies in the morning and evening after meals. The last shocking news were to discover that one of the children’s had pinworms/threadworms (the beauty of the motherhood!!!). The whole family was treated as reccomended but while I was researching about natural treatments along with traditional Mebendazole which is not good for any of us I came across to smothie with papayas, pineapples, coconuts, coconut oil and papaya seeds. I have been since making that smoothie almost every day for whole family every morning. I also give them anti-flamatory smothies with carrot, pinapple, turmeric, ginger etc or berry smoothies after evening meals. We are not worried about loosing weight for none of us as we are petite sizes =))) but I have notice obviously more bloating and gases for myself and hubby with colitis sometimes gets bad reactions so he takes it easy on smoothies those days. I rather give them fruit smoothies than chocolates or cookies as a treat as I have taken that complitely out of their diet and out our of shopping list for good=))))Your article is intresting but I have to choose lesser evil which is variety of fruit to compare other sugary things. I can see what are you trying to say and might explain all the bloating and gases but I grew up myself eating all day fruit as my Dad grew them in our huge back garden and never harmed me in any way. </p>
<p> Well that sure answers my current question. I have really cleaned up my diet after struggling for many years with food cravings. I gave up all processed foods, junk foods, snacks, lollies and chocolates. I eat plenty of vegetables nuts whole grains eggs chicken fish small amounts of dairy beef and drink plenty of water. And now I am absolutely bloated and always in pain…..maybe its the 5-6 pieces of fruit I eat a day. Owww and I thought this was better than the junk. Hmmm maybe I will try 2-3 fruits and see if it helps. </p>
<p> Thank you so much ! Althought , I knew that information it nice reminder..:) I think sugar, glucose is so addictive that people will come up with any reason to believe it healthy.. </p>
<p> I have hit a weight plateau this summer. I wish I would have read this article in June and not in August. I probably would have been more successful with my weight loss. I am definitely guilty of everything written and was confused why I stopped seeing results. Thanks for the advice. I’m on my new healthy and more balanced diet path. </p>
<p> My weight have not dropped at all. I make fruit smoothie everyday for breakfast. I have an apple and orange for my work snack. After reading this, I’m going to have fruit smoothie with greens for breakfast only. And veggies for both snacks and suppers. Will reply back in a month if weight finally dropps </p>
<p> I am so pleased I have stumbled across your article. I have been baffled by my Son’s weight gain – given that he eats healthy foods only drinks water and is very active. The weight is mostly around his belly and has bowel issues as well. He eats a lot of fruit (instead of processed foods) so this all makes sense to me now; I’ve been allowing him to eat too much fruit thinking I was doing the right thing giving him healthy food.. I will now cut right back on fruit and hopefully that will make a difference to both his weight and bowel problems. Thank you so much for this article! </p>
<p> Ohhhh! I have been eating WAY too much fruit! My diet was so bad and I have been eating healthily for the past 10 months but in the last two months my fruit intake has gone sky high. I was thinking it was healthy snacking but the fact my stomach has started bloating lately gave me cause for concern and an internet search led me here. I would think nothing of eating 6 apricots, 4 peaches and a couple of apples in a day…. along with a bit of fruit in my (mainly) green veg juice. I now realise i was craving the sugar in fruit and eating more made me eat more!! I will be much more mindful and hopefully the bloating and binge eating of fruit will stop and my weight loss will start again. </p>
<p> Well, it seems I identify with all of those signs, unfortunately. I’ll tell you something that happened this summer that really drove it home. I went on vacation with family for 8 days, and most of what we did was drive around and look at sites. Very little physical activity and NO working out. And we ate candy while we drove around. We ate three square meals a day, which I never do, so I ate more than I usually do. But the only fruit I really had was prunes and orange juice. When I came back, I had lost six pounds, which I haven’t been able to do in years! So I see a message in there…… </p>
<p> Just when you thought it was safe to dip into the fruit bowl. Jeez Louise i’m currently finishing a one pound bag of red seedless. seriously I’m NOT over weight reasonably healthy though could lose ten pounds i thought my fruit intake was one of the better aspects of my diet evidently not I’ll try to transpose at least a vegetable portion for a fruit one. Sigh?!!! What’s next. Sex. it is then i draw the proverbial line and boycott self help articles. But seriously very interesting reading thanks </p>
<p> I had to comment because your article resonated so clearly with my experience. I would describe myself as a fruit junkie (6 servings easily in a day). I knew in the back of my mind that this was problematic but told myself it was better than processed “carbs”. I have been dealing with signicant issues of bloating and other unpleasantness. I had recently eliminated gluten to evaluate if that was the culprit but the problem persists. Your article makes me think I cannot tolerate fructose in large quantities. Thank you! I will immediately make this change and look forward to feeling better. I still wonder about the high fructose content in most processed foods? Is it the same? Given the reliance on these factory foods, I would think more people would be experiencing reactions? </p>
<p> Too much of anything is unhealthy, we all know that, but if you’re going to claim that you’re eating too much fruit simply because “you love juice” then I’m sorry but you’re just not being serious. Please write your articles in a slightly less ridiculous manner. Also, you suggest only 2 small portions of fruit a day while nearly all respected health organization, WHO included, suggest more. I guess they have much more authority for me. </p>
<p> Reading this while sipping my second fruit and veggie smoothie for the day, oops! </p>
<p> Hey this has been a very interesting blog and I am very grateful for your potential guidance. Today I am eliminating all fruit from my diet for 2 weeks to see what happens. I was diagnosed with many food intolerances in October and have been avoiding foods like dairy, gluten wheat, avocado, nuts, soya potatoes and many more. However I have also been formally diagnosed with coeliac disease as confirmed through a gastroscopy and biopsy. But due to the inflammation and poor gut I have put on weight 10kgs from May to Aug. I have now stayed around the same but since adjusting my diet, of eliminating everything, eating only fresh cooked foods no processed foods including gluten free products and breads I have not lost a lb! I have increased my fruit intake and use it for snacks and when I’m hungry. But as you say this does not curb my hunger!!!! I have reintroduced milk (to add to tea only) as of yesterday and this seem ok so I am hoping I could so introduce eggs etc into my diet. </p>
<p> I really hope that fruit has been my problem and I can lose some of this excess weight I have gained which makes me feel dreadful! Thank you and ill try to keep you posted 😉 </p>
<p> Good luck on your journey, Georgina. Remember, everyone has an individual tolerance for fruit, so I don’t necessarily recommend eliminating it completely. </p>
<p> I relate to eating too much fruit. Prob having about 6 serves a day. Weight loss difficult and I look like I’m bloated! Thanks for your information. </p>
<p> One year ago I was diagnosed with C-diff and it was horrible. My digestive system is still not normal. I don’t know what to eat anymore. Before that I had a lactose problem now they tell me it may get worse. I was also told that I now have IBS. So I have been trying to eat lighter and smaller meals. I have been eating a lot of fruit and I have a very bloated stomach by the end of the day. I told my husband maybe I am eating too much fruit. I have four servings a day. I have even almost eliminated gluten too. It has been very challenging and painful. I have discomfort almost every day in my digestive system. I am going to cut back on the fruit to see if the bloated stomach goes away. Thank you for the information. </p>
<p> I gave up refined sugar and grains last year and then decided this year (ie two weeks ago) that I would only eat one portion of fruit a day for January. I used to eat about 6, plus 8 or so veggies. </p>
<p> I managed the ‘one a day’ (usually blueberries, plus the other veggies) until today when I caved, and have eaten 1 1/2 apples, cup of blueberries, lots of mango, 2 nectarines, some kiwi and some melon. I have been craving fruit almost hourly for the 2 weeks, which I didn’t expect as I had been off refined sugar, honey, maple syrup and sweeteners for at least 2 months at this point. But then today, after eating lots of fruit, my body and mind have gone HAYWIRE. I have had a constant “brain-fart”, not able to concentrate, feeling exhausted, lazy, lethargic and constantly trying to work out if I felt like this before January 1st when it was my usual daily dosage of fruit. </p>
<p> Definitely going back to my usual (for January) meals tomorrow – measuring my 80g of berries and not having any other fruits. I do NOT want to feel like this again! </p>
<p> …I probably am eating too much fruit! I wondered if I was because a few months ago I radically changed my lifestyle eating habits and whilst I feel as though my middle is a bit slimmer, I thought I would have lost more weight by now. So I googled it and saw your article. </p>
<p> I eat fruit for breakfast every morning with nuts, thing is though I eat a lot! Then when I come home in the evening I usually eat another 2-3 pieces of fruit….I am definately going to reduce my fruit intake…thank you </p>
<p> I think I’m eating too much fruit because even though I don’t do any processed foods and i workout 4-5 times a week my weight won’t budge and the belly fat is there. And, I have digestive issues anyway and have seemed more bloated. So, I think you answered my questions. Obviously I was thinking it or I wouldn’t have found your site? </p>
<p> OMG.!,, thank you Lily. After two to three weeks binging on loads of fruit,, i felt more bloated than ever and kept putting on weight i decided the only thing i was doing differently was eating lots of fruit and that had to be the reason. I only just realised that fruit has loads of natural sugars that could not have been doing me any favours. Everything you said proved true for me. The more fruit i ate the more i wanted to eat. !! Crazy.. i just googled the subject of side affects of too much fruit and after reading your article was extremely pleased to have my suspicions confirmed. It was tho you wrote the article just for me. Thank you and as of this morning, no more fruit for a while for me!!! </p>
<p> I have been eating a big bowl of fruit salad for breakfast every day for the last 3 months, thinking it would be good for my health and help me to lose weight. Well my weight hasn’t budged and this week I have felt really unwell with awful stomach pain and bloating. I stumbled across an article about fructose intolerance and malabsorption and recognised the symptoms immediately. Paid a visit to my GP as the pain felt like period pain ( coming from my ovary) (went through the menopause 12 years ago) but she said I was probably suffering from IBS. So I will definately be laying off fruit for a while until things return to normal!! </p>
<p> I eat a minimum of 3 servings of fruit a day! I will eat an apple at break and lunch, sometimes a banana with breakfast, and then grapes at lunch, and an apple after dinner! I have eaten a lot more fruit the last few months, about 4 a day and I have noticed I have put on weight on my lower stomach area. As well I have had bad stomach pains too and bloating. Will this be permanent ? </p>
<p> Wow. I just found this and everything I can agree with. I am ,in fact, eating too much fruit. The sugar cravings, the bloating, the not losing weight, all of what you said, I’m like “are they like reading my mind???!!!” I am going to cut back on fruits. I would have NEVER guessed that a healthy food can be “bad.” Hopefully decreasing to two portions daily will help me to lose weight. Something I’ve been struggling with FOR YEARS. Wish me luck! </p>
<p> Whoops, I have been eating about 3 portions a day. I think I will stick to 2. I would much rather eat a bowl of grapes than a packet of potato chips though. But I hear you on the vegetables… I think I should probably focus on getting more of that in my eating habits. </p>
<p> This might be a bit off topic but I personally am not trying to lose weight but rather I gym everyday and I eat fruit (strictly) for lunch. The reason being is its easy to throw some fruit into a lunchbox and cheap (where I stay). Its healthy and Im allergic to nuts so something like muesli and yogurt wont work for me. </p>
<p> I probably have like 2 bananas and two handfulls of grapes (as an example) per day. </p>
<p> Now, if i get to gym everyday surely the sugar isnt an issue as it wont be in my system long enough to be converted into and stored as carbs and should be used up when I work out right? </p>
<p> Basically I want to know if this is a good idea or if im countering my workout due to the sugar intake? </p>
<p> I’ve been having liver problems that started not long after I began eating a fruit packed smoothie every morning. After I eat the smoothie, about 30 minutes, I’m starving for lunch. I’ve been struggling to figure out what is upsetting off my liver and why I’m so darn hungry. I think I’ll cut down on the fruit and see if things resolve. </p>
<p> I’ve been counting calories since November and have lost 25lbs. But with every lb. lost my daily kcal budget decreased so I started eating lots of fruit and trying to eat clean believing that I was eating healthy. I got addicted to fruit smoothies and was having about 2 a day. (1/2 CUP BLUEBERRIES 2 SLICES PINEAPPLE AND 1/4 banana and chia seeds or protein. Powder) After about 2 weeks ,I awoke feeling like I needed to throw up and my stomach felt out of sorts for about a week. This is reason I looked up this topic. </p>
<p> I found this article on a google search. I am a recent smoothie convert and was concerned about my new Ultra High dose of fruits per day. My concerns were backed up … great article… I’ll be using more green leafy and avocado etc and a little less fruit. Thanks! </p>
<p> I eat a lot fruit thinking it would help me lose weight. I’ve actually gained weight & im having a problem losing it! </p>
<p> just learnt that eating the same fruits in a day is not good like having maybe 2 apples in a day is not advisible..how true is that?? and if is true why is not advisible, what is the happening when i have 2 or more fruits of the same kind in a day. </p>
<p> Sometimes I eat so much blueberries that my excrement smells like blueberries am I eating too many blueberries? </p>
<p> I am currently in severe stomach distress so I consulted my favorite physician — Google — for a diagnosis. Last night, I mindlessly snacked on a rather large portion (2 cups, perhaps) of leftover fruit salad that I had made two days prior. I had trouble falling asleep (4 hours of tossing and turning) and awoke just an hour later with bloating, gas pain and colic, bowel noises, nausea and diarrhea. An hour later, I am full on vomitting with runny bloody diarrhea. Well, not only did I have WAAAY TOO much fruit, but I also learned that I could have easily misprepared the fruit salad by not washing the rind of the cantaloupe and using the same knife to cut the rind off as I did to cut it up, without so much as washing in between. Google taught me that this alone could introduce bacteria including the dreaded e-Coli! </p>
<p> I am particularly sensitive to e-Coli having been terribly affected (and hospitalized) by it six years ago. I nearly lost my life then when the bacteria attacked my pancreas and threw me into a (sudden onset) diabetic coma. I was warned then that the littlest bit of e-Coli could cause an e-Coli storm in my intestines — and I thought that meant I must avoid undercooked red meats, not my beloved fruits! </p>
<p> I recently decided to keep track of the fruit I eat and discovered I can eat over 800g in 1 day! Definitely need to reign in my portion control. The amount of sugar I must be getting is crazy. Hopefully I will finally start to loose some weight as well. </p>
<p> I eat way too much fruit. Probably about 7 portions per day. Will this be the cause of my current skin issues? </p>
<p> I make smoothie with one Apple, fresh aloe Vera, cucumber and about 60 grms of blueberry, I hope am not taking too high fructose levels doing that, I have been doing this for more than six months now, and being a athematic I must say my immunity has never been better, Though I think I have felt bloating issue many number of times, I recently have started taking two slices of full grain breads along with it, to give my smoothie some solidity, thanks for giving me idea of combining it with nuts, Would you like to suggest some tweek in my breakfast scheme? It will be highly appreciable </p>
<p> If you eat to much fruit will it also make your blood pressure stay up if you off of salt? </p>
<p> Not only is this article complete BS, I can’t believe this person identifies herself as a nutritionist when there is a statement in here about fruit “spiking blood sugar” (completely untrue and proven so by SCIENCE). Please DO NOT listen to this person. Fruit is an amazing source of nutrition and there are NO adverse health effects of adding fruit to your diet and, actually, not really an adverse effects of adding fruit to your diet in regards to your weight. Listen to science, not some person who is literally sabotaging you by telling you to simply starve yourself when you’re hungry so you can be thin. Also, I have maintained my weight after losing 20 pounds with eating pretty much unlimited fruit when I am hungry. I only eat until I feel satisfied…but some days I eat as many as 4- 6 bananas… and that is just bananas. </p>
<p> Side note: Fruit actually helps regulate blood sugar for diabetics when added to meals despite that fact it has (god forbid) natural fructose (the devil, right?!). </p>
<p> This is a very unfair way to characterise the article. You are not considering relativity. Certainly the spike in blood sugar from an ice cream cone is not the same that of a banana – but the banana will cause a spike nonetheless. It stands to reason that if the banana is a stand-out on the glycemic index for a person (higher than the rest of her diet), that spike will have a greater effect than on someone who eats poorly. </p>
<p> Also, nowhere in the article does the author suggest starving oneself to be thin. It seems to me the author is trying to help people, not sabatoge anyone. </p>
<p> Having read the studies you refer to, a very small amount of fructose in a meal results in lower blood sugars if it replaces an isocaloric amount of glucose. However, if you just eat less glucose instead the effect is likely to be superior; and fructose in these small amounts is also supplied by carrot, beetroot, parsnip, sweet potato, and so on – there is nothing special about fruit. Replacing a potato with a sweet potato will give you the “catalytic” dose of fructose AND a lower carbohydrate load overall. </p>
<p> I never comment but your comment is just beyond ridiculous that I couldn’t help it..you sure do have a friend in healthy but not apparently happy Mr. Anonymous! And sorry I’m being rude as well! Lily knew she would get some haters but she’s only trying to help Unlike You!! EVERY body is unique and it’s great that you handle abundance amounts of fruit..others simply CANNOT. I cannot!! I can tolerate some berries after a gym workout but otherwise get heartburn, bloating and fatigue. Her article is 100% accurate.. Now please stop being a bully..why are you even here..you clearly haven’t read ALL the comments regarding certain digestive systems that simply cannot tolerate a lot of fruit in a day. She clearly did not say that fruit is bad! </p>
<p> I almost did not read your article but I’m glad I did because I recently added more fruit to my diet and became very gassy and it was killing me. I laid off the fruit for a couple of days and I was good. Well last night I had 2 fresh pears and now my stomach is cutting up again. I am already lactose intolerant so when my stomach reacts like this my first thought is “Did I gave dairy”? I want to continue to have the fresh fruit and now I know what to eat and what not to eat. I believe I am fructose intolerant as well so this article was very helpful. </p>
<p> I never thought about eating too much fruit before reading this article. The reason I searched for “can fruit give you gas pains” was because I was getting very bad gas pains in my lower abdomen. I constantly have smoothies with TONS of fruit. Also I put TONS of fruit in my oatmeal while thinking this was very healthy. Thank you for this article as it was really eye opening! And no, I’m not mad at you for saying the truth.. and my stomach thanks you. Hmmm I am thin but now wondering if all my fruits are keeping my belly fat?? I eat healthy but love my sugar and I am a bit outside the normal sugar range which is 108. Thank you so very much!!!!! WOW! </p>
<p> Great article! I make a smoothie about 3-4 times a week as a meal supplement – water, frozen fruit variety, Greek yogurt, little honey, protein powder & green powder (green veggies). I thought that was a great idea but now I’m reconsidering! Any thoughts? </p>
<p> I’m suffering certainly with Feeling bloatd & stomach pain, my weight loss has also come to a standstill so I do feel from reading your comments that I’m eating far too much fruit. </p>
<p> I agree with some of your posts/disagree.you have to think about each individual different situation. Such as smedication(they’re prescribed) how it has to be taken w/or w/out FD. There age. Wt. How much they eat or drink or get enough in a day. I mmyself have health iissues. & One minute were told all the time ieat your fruit and vegetables this many times a day. No one is really saying stay away from Apples red or green. Stay away from bananas. All I here are lies. And people contradicting there stories. From fitness trainers to movie stars. Saying what they don’t eat. But then caught w/ something they don’t eat. I’m saying I think fruit/vegetables are gd for you. & All the stores I go to spouts.whole foods. Trader Joe’s. People have a basket full of everything. Like I was stating….I health problems. A turkeytearian .been since 95. I also have COPD diagnosed in 07 never ever smoked a day in my life 49.102 lbs. Been on steroids( pill form 20mg it changes. & Always in the hospital. So you see. No judgement from me. Good look to everyone and their goals.O & my potassium is always low. My Dr recommend a banana 2times a day. </p>
<p> I eat WAAAAY too much fruit! I can put away 3 pounds of blueberries every day… way too expensive and I have not been able to lose weight! </p>
<p> I found this article very interesting. Since much of the info out there is focused on those just starting to make changes for health, it’s nice to find advice for those of us looking to further improve an already healthy diet and lifestyle. I identify with several of the issues you called out – by the standards you outline I typically eat 3 servings of fruit a day, so I am cutting my allotment by 1/3 to see how it effects me. I do have a question tho. You suggest some smoothie combinations to lessen blood sugar impact – why do you single out coconut milk as opposed to other dairy-free options? (I usually switch between soy and almond.) I’m curious what about coconut milk makes it the best choice. Thanks. I just found your site through this article and look forward to coming back. </p>
<p> I think that rather than hate you, fruit lovers like me are going to love you. I decided to googled this topic cause I recently started to work out and with that comes new better eating habits. I thought that eating fruit was good but now a days I sincerely do not know what good is. I thought that I was eating too much fruit and you just confirmed it. I have been pretty much snacking on mostly fruits and I cannot go without my smoothies. You make excellent suggestions. I think that my lesson from reading your post is that everything should be taken in moderation. This is my first time leaving a comment but what you wrote is so informative that I had to honestly thank you. </p>
<p> I dont normally eat much fruit, am a veg person normally. But lately have been craving fruit. I ate 6 portions in one sitting.!. The next morning woke with tummy ache and trots. Feal very bloated, and even put on wieght.. Now your piece has enlightened me I’l go back to 2 times a day. Thankyou. </p>
<p> I eat on average a banana a orange a apple handful blueberries 4 strawberries couple small pieces of watermelon every single day I went from 217 to 158 I eat no meat eat handful raw broccoli spinach cauliflower mushrooms 4 baby carrots everyday eat walnuts sunflower seeds almonds pumpkin seeds along with way to many cashews and peanuts everyday eat Greek yogurt eggs fish whole grain bread 3- 4 times a week MY OPINION ONLY eat the hell out of fruits it’s gods version of cupcakes candy bars and birthday cake </p>
<p> You say you don’t eat meat, but then say you eat fish? It’s only or the other–not both. And just because eating a lot of fruit works for you, doesn’t mean it works for everyone. If I ate as much fruit as you everyday, I would be spending most of my time on the toilet with diarrhea. </p>
<p> There is a lot of evidence that large amounts of fructose can cause harm when consumed in excess. However, this depends on the dosage and context and does not apply to fruit. You can’t fit in the amount of whole fruits into your stomach, for the fructose to cause harm. It’s like saying Coke can give you cancer, yes studies have shown that, but you leave out that it only applies if you drink 80 litres of coke everyday for 60 years. It’s selective information I guess. </p>
<p> Okay, well you try explaining that to my digestive system then. Besides lactose, the only other thing to give me extreme digestive issues is fruit. No other high fiber foods cause as much trouble. </p>
<p> Thank you so much for this enlightening article. I started to make a google search on “eating fruit and digestion” because I am just back from a trip when I ate pretty much no fruits for ten days. I was craving for it but guess what? The “junk food” I was eating (bread, meat, cheese, salads, that kind of things) magically stopped the diarrhea I was suffering from for months while I was feeding myself pretty much on fruits. It also sure rings a bell about the impossibility to lose weight… will try it out! 🙂 </p>
<p> I just recently started making smoothies. With fruit, unsweetened almond milk, and protein powder. I have one for breakfast and one for lunch and then eat a reasonable dinner. I was a fast food 3x a day person and never ate fruit. I cannot handle textures.. pretty picky with veggies too, so I have began to supplement with a shot of wheatgrass in the morning. (Made from organic powder in my home). I’m still not losing weight. – feeling defeated. </p>
<p> I did a search on eating fruit and upset stomach and ended up here. What a great bit of reading, I don’t have a sweet tooth so craving sugar is not an issue BUT. last week I decided to add more fruit to my diet, what a disaster! I had a train journey to make last Friday and had consumed a punnet (small one) of blue berries a few hours before. I ended up having to stand outside of the train loo for the last hour of the journey, feeling bloated, sick, hot, cold and really quite unwell. I thought I had picked up a 12 hour bug. It took me until Saturday before I felt properly well again, I didn’t link the blueberries at all. Today I bought a pint of mixed fruit and eat the lot after a salad lunch and my god I am feeling it again now. Not as bad as Friday but still enough that I am sitting at my desk feeling bloated, sore and know I’m going to need a loo close by. Not nice! I need to lose some weight so I’m going to take a leaf out of this blog and cut myself down to two pieces of fruit a day maximum and see how I go. </p>
<p> I have been trying to figure out the culprit of my bloating.. I originally thought it was the beans, lentils and brown rice I was consuming. Although I don’t eat as many servings of that as I do fruit. After reading this article, I’m thinking that I’ve been consuming too much fruit, YIKES!!!!! and not enough leafy veggies. I have to asses my diet, reduce the fruit and add more veggies … Boy, I hope this helps with my digestion. </p>
<p> I decided to eat cleaner, and I love fruit! I ate fruit in the morning, afternoon, evening and in between. I love fruit and figured its fresh, nutritious, unprocessed etc! It’s so easy to grab some fruit out of the big bowl of cut up pineapples, melons, strawberries for a snack or an alternate to pop corn or chips and cookies! Well, I began experiencing bloating, indigestion, burning sensation in abdominal area. This went in for a couple weeks. My husband just lost his job, so I had no insurance. I was on web-md diagnosing myself with everthing from ulcers to cancer! Then at work I was feeling nauseated, and miserable! I tried to eat a chicen ceasar salad, but was just too sick. I ate two minuscule pieces of lettuce, sipped on some club soda and just could not eat. ( I found the club soda to be soothing)The burning, bloating and nausea had gotten the best of me. I didnt eat all day and the discomfort began to subside. Never did it enter my mind it could be my fresh healthy fruit. After all, I could live on fresh fruit and some protein. Later that evening feeling some hunger pangs, but afraid to eat only sipping perrier. I finally threw caution to the wind and got a plain hot dog from 7-11 as I was starving. I waited for the dreaded burning, bloating and nausea. It didnt happen. I drank club soda and later had some brown rice and garlic shrimp and a thai ice tea. No pain or discomfort. I later had some cheese and crackers, no problem. I finally started to realize maybe it was all the fruit! I began searching google and found this thread! What a relief to find it probably isn’t cancer. This morning not a bite of fruit and my stomach is 90 improved. I will now be incorporating more veggies and easing up on the fruit to see how things go. </p>
<p> I have been going to weight watchers and slimming world in the past which fruit is no points/sins. I love fruit and I consume at least 7 portions a day but not shifting weight like I feel I should. Which is annoying because I do everything by the book. Then I get told I eat to much fruit. Reading this makes me realise why. I do get bloated but not always. I will try cutting it down to 2 portions and maybe snack add some vegetables as I usually only have 1-2 a day. Thank you for this article it defiantly makes me realise why I may not be losing the weight. </p>
<p> Thank you very much for your very informative article. I am one of the many readers who binged on fruit and never thought it to be an issue as I am quite lean, very active and have no problems with my sugar levels. But now, I know better and will try to cut back on the fruit. The difficulty is what else to eat between meals as I am a vegetarian, eats loads of vegetables including green juice and I try to eat processed food like rice crackers sparingly. thanks again, </p>
<p> After reading your very informative article, I fall under #1. I noticed that after eating a couple of peaches a day, I was very bloated and my sugar readings were slightly higher. Also noticed weight gain, I guess from the bloating and I am pretty fit, but with the peaches I noticed a difference. I will be cutting out peaches! </p>
<p> Denying holocaust is a sin but denying fruit is the most optimal food for human kind isn’t. How funny is that. I’m sorry Lily, I swear I don’t want to pick you or anything but you even have an apple in your logo on your site, that tells me something. </p>
<p> I was raised a meat eater and became a massive fruit eater some months ago but I still don’t suffer from any of the points you described. Even my blood test is perfect. My cravings disappeared for sugar when I started to eat so many fruits and comes back everytime I don’t have the access to fresh, juicy goods. </p>
<p> I’m truly sad that you have eggs and meat promoted on your site yet you don’t write a post about “5 signs you are eating too much fat and protein”. The 5 points would be: </p>
<p> 1. You are obese 2. You generally experience heart attacks 3. You have sweet tooth after each meal 4. Your conscience is telling you to stop killing innocent beings 5. You tend to become ill more often </p>
<p> Of course these points are a bit edgy but so your points are. All of them are real concerns about consuming mostly fat and protein instead of carbohydrates, which fuels our body naturally. You even know that well if you have a degree of nutrition. </p>
<p> Well good for you. You may not experience any of these problems, but many people do. </p>
<p> I take a sandwich bag full of grapes and cherries. I also have one smoothie a day made with 1 cup of blackberries, strawberries 1 bananak and vanilla yogurt. Also one scoop of greens. Is this to much fruit. </p>
<p> Hi Lily, I came across your post after I googled, “Will I have painful moments if I switch to eating only fresh fruits and vegetables? ” Very informitive. I googled this coz I have had an increase in headaches, bad ones! And yesterday, I thought I’d eat a bowl chicken chili. I got very sick, and vomited many times, and I got so weak I could barely walk. Anyway, I am male, 54 yrs old and thought I was losing weight.The bloating thing really hit true for me. My stomach looks twice it’s normal size. HELP! </p>
<p> Just an insight to my day – half a watermelon, 3 kiwis, 3 pears, 2 apples, 2 oranges, berries, a whole box of strawberries. !!!!! and i wonder why im not loosing weight! thankyou for sharing this </p>
<p> this article is so wrong. i had IBS but that was from consuming too much foods with refined white table sugar not fruit. I no longer drink sugared beverages and cut down drastically foods with table sugar but i now eat a lot fruit. The results are no more IBS and i have lost weight!!! </p>
<p> Wow…just because it doesn’t match your own experiences doesn’t mean it’s wrong. You should consider getting off of that high horse while you’re at it. </p>
<p> My smoothie for three days 8 oz day drink consist of 2 med bananas, 1 lg cucumber,1 cup or more mixed organic spinach, kale, arugula, 1/3-1/2 cup, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, 2 small cups Activia yogurt, 1/2 cup brewed green tea, 2 tablespoons organic Bragg’s apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp turmeric. No bloating, diarrhea, exercise 3 days week, walk 2-5 miles 4-5 days week, but cannot lose desired 10 lbs midsection weight. Should I cut some of the fruit? </p>
<p> Hi Lilly Can you please explain how fructose raises blood sugar. I haven’t managed to understand that myself. Best wishes Jillian </p>
<p> I just want to say that I would never unfollow you because of my love for fruit. </p>
<p> I tried removing all common food allergens to see if my digestive problems would go away. Between the diet change itself and all that healthy food I was eating, everything got way worse. </p>
<p> Why?? This elimination diet didn’t accommodate for IBS-inducing (high-fodmap) foods, and I was actually eating more of them (including at least all that fruit!) as I avoided other foods. </p>
<p> I still have problems 1, 2, 4, and 5 in your list, and it’s because I’m a non-discriminatory food lover with a discriminatory digestive system. </p>
<p> As I eat loads of plums and peaches that my coworkers brought in from their trees, your post is a great reminder that natural does not mean unconditionally healthy, and it all comes down to moderation. I want to put “moderation” in all caps, because it’s that important, but I don’t want it to look rude. I’m going to go for that happy place of no more than two servings a day and see how I feel. </p>
<p> I just finished a MS in Nutrition and am surprised we didn’t talk about fructose sensitivity. Ironically enough I’ve been having digestive issues and I’m starting to make connections to the large amounts of fruit I’ve been eating. I understand how blood sugar can be impacted but I am not aware of I what you mentioned in a comment about having difficulty digesting a protein-containing meal with fruit. You said, “turns out it alters the pH and enzyme environment of the stomach, making digesting a large amount of protein quite difficult.” Do you have some evidence based research you can refer me to so I can understand this more? </p>
<p> (I thought fructose was converted into fat by the liver and does not become glucose) </p>
<p> Right with you Lily. Fruit is advertised to us both in nature and marketing as being better for us than it really is. </p>
<p> I think of this post every time I purchase fruit. It is so true. Veggies can be just as yummy. Add some legumes or beans to a salad for a healthy dinner. I also love egg salad on a bed on fresh spinach for a quick and easy lunch. I live in FLA so am fortunate to have fresh fruit and veggies year round. </p>
<p> Hi Lily! Welcome to the PNW! Rob and I loved it there and we are hoping to be back next summer. I know you will enjoy all the wonderful things the area has to offer! When adjusting my diet, I realized I was eating too much fruit through my sugar intake. I had to remember (and still need to remind myself) that even though it’s not processed sugar, it’s still sugar and a little goes a long way. I also realized that I wasn’t eating enough whole grains. So I actually switched out a high-sugar fruit (which I was eating with the thought of getting vitamins and fiber), with a low-sugar, low-glycemic granola bar as my mid-morning snack. I had way more energy and my digestion got back on track surprisingly quickly. Though, that being said, the northwest cherries are amazing. As always, thank you for your food advice! -Jill </p>
<p> lol.. you are all bloated and gassy from eating flesh of dead bodies and the coagulated bodily fluids of other beings.. not from eating fruit as nature intended humans who are frugivores to eat. </p>
<p> …Hi!! I eat 2 or 3 fruits every morning but not half cups of each. Usually rasp./straw./blueb./blackb. or a part of a banana…maybe oj. but small servings. Is that over doing? I don’t seem to ever have any bm problems. Sandee lee </p>
<p> yessssssssssss! at last, someone who agrees with me. a few years ago my new boss (at a health centre) suggested we go on a detox weekend. I chose fruit – oh wow!! never again,. I bloated, cramped, burped and all the other ghastly results of over-fruiting. luckily salads and veggies are my favourite, so to cut out fruit was not an issue. sometimes I have half an apple, or some berries or a kiwi with plain yoghurt, almonds and flaxseeds. but usually only weekly. I am dead against juicing and smoothies owing to the amount of sugar consumed in one portion. when I see someone drinking fresh orange juice, I ask them to guess how many oranges went into it. when I see parents loading up with commercial fruit juices I remind them of the amount of sugar and tell them its the same as giving their kids a soda. usually they don’t want to know, they look so virtuous! and most kids get a small carton of fruit juice in their lunch boxes. why not just give them a small coke? its going to take a while to re-educate but I am looking after my 3 grandsons at the moment, and they are getting the message! the younger two only drink milk(after breakfast) and water, they don’t like sodas or fruit juice. success! </p>
<p> Good morning Lily it has been mentioned to us that we eat far too much fruit. I must emphasise that I am extremely health conscious most of the time, but occasionally binge. Every second day we have a smoothie consisting of 1 stick celery, 1 carrot. 1 avo but not always, 1 piece pineapple, 1 piece paw paw, 1 banana, 1 guava, 5 strawberries and sometimes approximately a few slices of root ginger, This we put into our blender with 1 cup double thick plain yoghurt and 1 cup full cream milk. To this we add 1 tablespoon raw honey. Let’s hear what you have to say about this haha. </p>
<p> I eat as a very large breakfast daily – in my nutra bullet raspberries,blueberries,blackberries,ground almonds,chia seeds,pumpkin seeds,sunflower seeds,flax seeds,q 10,walnuts,Brazil nuts,sesame seeds,full fat Greek yogurt,agave syrup,dates and almond milk..result = NO Sugar cravings, I am FULL for the ENTIRE day until evening, my skin shines, loads of energy SUSTAINED. Having suffered from gallstones from a diet high in cheese years ago I find that on the rare occasions I have had an attack after being tempted with a cheese dish (the only food my body will willingly accept and feel good on is the above mix of nutrients. </p>
<p> I forgot to mention that in my daily nutrabullet drink I also add raw coconut oil, hemp ground. </p>
<p> I eat in one day 2 granny apples, 2 nectarines or peaches, a good handfull of strawberries and oikos yogurt with a ton of fresh blueberries added to it. Feel very bloated and agitated afterwards so now i know why, thank you for this insight and please know that i try to be very healthy with my food choices, i used to weigh 243 pounds and now i am 123 pounds and have kept it off with diet and exercise for 10 years but in the last year have become addicted to fruit but have severe bloating so any advice would be appreciated, i am 41 years old and female if this means anything </p>
<p> The “low fruit group” ate 51g of fruit, while the “high fruit group” ate 125g of fruit daily. For reference, a small apple weighs about 150g. Sorry, your study does not “prove that eating too much fruit is harmless.” </p>
<p> In this study, the “high fruit group” wasn’t even eating an entire apple daily! </p>
<p> OH! So glad I found this!! I’ve been eating more fruit – mostly as a way to stay hydrated and maybe lose weight. But I can’t lose any!! I’ve way reduced carbs, no carbonated drinks, very little processed food…. And, I’ve developed horrible bloating and ‘bathroom issues’ —– I’m going to take a look at my fruit intake, I think I may be having to much. I’ve even substituted fruit for a meal……. It’s at least somethin to look at and analyze!! </p>
<p> In total shock that you can eat too much fruit! Yes I have been extra amounts since I got my new blender. It’s just to easy too do. I will be cutting back as from today, learning I suffer the side affects. Thank for the tip! </p>
<p> Thank for the tip. I definitely suffer fruit side affects. Will be cutting back as from today. </p>
<p> I am so glad I’ve read your article. I have all the five symptoms mentioned. I joined Slimming World and eat huge amounts of fruit. I cannot begin to tell you the pain and bloating I’ve been suffering. I told the leader about this and she laughed it off. I’ve lost five stone and have struggled with my last four pound. I feel now I’m not going mad. Can’t wait to share this with some fellow sufferers. Thank you so much. X </p>
<p> I run 70-80 miles per week and eat unlimited fruit. I’m talking 8-10 lbs of grapes per day, along with some mango and watermelon. It really is disgusting. I wonder as I get older my body cannot handle all the fruit, as I do seem to be a bit more bloated, but I am so hooked. If I don’t get my grapes, I am extremely grumpy. </p>
<p> I found this really helpful! I’m currently half marathon training and have increased my fruit intake. I also absolutely love smoothies and usually have a glass of OJ mid morning. Immediately after eating, I was getting stomach aches and had to go, I was worried for my training and your article has reassured to me that there is such a thing as having too much, balance is key! </p>
<p> Unfortunately, I just ate 8 apricots (and that was definitely not even half of the fruit I ate all day…). Gonna have to work on it. </p>
<p> I have stage 4 cancer (liver) I’m eating probably 6 bowls of fresh fruit a fay. I don’t understand why in craving it so badly. Is it good or bad for my liver? </p>
<p> I joined Weight Watchers Dec 30. I am down 30 pounds, and thank fruit for that. Most fruits are 0 points, so I have been eating lots of fruit, so I can eat dinner with my hubby. I have a few of the symptoms you mentioned, and no idea where they may have come from! Now I know, and thank you! Look out veggies, my new love!! </p>
<p> Into my second week of a four week stay on the island of Malta. Nice and hot and eating plenty of fresh fruit thinking it’s the right thing to do. Only to find myself in the early hours with a painful stomach and running to the loo. Thinking back I’ve concluded after looking online it is to many prickly pears. However, coming upon this sight has lead me to a whole new way of looking at fruit and of how they should be consumed. You have possibly saved me from having more of upset stomach in the future. Thanks. </p>
<p> Such an interesting read, I am a google-holic and after googling ‘eating too much fruit’ your page appeared! </p>
<p> I currently follow the ‘slimming world’ diet, however the last few weeks I have been wobbling – as it doesn’t feel ‘natural’ but with a weight increase and my own test at eating healthily causing this gain I decided I had no option but to revert back to the plan. BUT I find myself eating 5-7 fruits a day, because they are ‘free’ ‘unlimited’ my weight loss is improved if I avoid bananas – and I knew about the carbohydrates. But seeing it all in black and white, wow! Thank you for an altered perspective </p>
<p> Thank you for this article, I did a search because of bloating, tummy cramps and very sore ‘ waste exit area’ yes I’m on diet where fruit is ‘free’, tho I do love fruit but definitely overdoing it, this article is very sensible and balanced, and an eye opener for me, so I’m going to cut back on fruit and consentrate on more veg and a more balanced approach to diet . Thank you !! </p>
<p> I definitely do think I’m eating too much fruit, I generally have a whole banana, 1/2 cup blueberries in a smoothie after the gym with my protein powder, chai seeds and peanut butter and a few other goodies, then I have an apple and an orange and sometimes watermelon and other fruit too!! I’m way over the fruit scale and find no matter how hard I train I struggle to lose weight!! I love the quote “treat fruit as a dessert not celery sticks” it really has me re-thinking how much fruit I’m eating, I will definitely reduce the amount and try to mainly have berries from now on!! Thanks so much ? </p>
<p> Hi there. In the past 7-8 weeks I’ve been eating raw foods and a hot meal at night. I’m vegan previously. I have found I’ve gained weight. I’m bloated, I have gas all the time, loose bowels… I’ve eaten mainly fruit. I starting following fruitians in a Facebook page. Everyone said the weight drops off, wellness and energy on a fruit raw diet 24/7. No one else have posted the symptoms I have… in the past 2 weeks I’ve had a sharp headache that comes on after my fruit lunch. I found your post from looking online, ” is too much fruit bad for you?” I’m definitely going to stop the fruit island! It’s not living when your life is based around a toilet…. </p>
<p> I absolutely relate to the factor of bloating! I consume a great deal of fruit. Thanks for the tips. </p>
<p> Wow, thank you for this information!! I’ve been living by the at least 5 fruits or veggies/day rule for the last couple years but recently been eating more fruit. A couple months ago I had to take some antibiotics. Ever since then I’ve had a ton of diarrhea. I read that lactose can cause diarrhea for 6 weeks after antibiotics, so I thought it must be my morning yogurt causing the problem. Then one day I had the yogurt without any fruit and I had no diarrhea! So I’ve been experimenting since then. I was eating a lot of fruit before my morning yogurt, like 1 apple + 1 plum + 1 kiwi + 1 banana + 1 avocado. I thought I was really being nice to my body by eating so much fruit. After reading your article I am guessing that the real cause of my diarrhea is the fruit!! It’s going to be hard to eat a lot less fruit, but I think it’s worth a try. Is it possible to develop fructose intolerance later in one’s life and all the sudden? I was doing fine until 2 months ago. I am in my mid-50s, athletic, thin, vegequarian (vegetarian plus a little bit of fish). Thanks again! This article was very helpful! </p>
<p> False post…….I’m going to keep it simple…..eat fruits before any food or eat fruit as food, above mentioned problems or solved! and one more thing, eat fruit as much as you want it won’t hurt you, but keep in mind organic is real! </p>
<p> This is some really great information. It was easy to understand. Recently I have been eating too much fruit and this information really helped me understand about how much ftuit to eat. Thank you so much this information really helped and I am now going to share this website with my friends.?? </p>
<p> Man, this kinda bums me out. I have been trying to eat better and have substituted fruit for snacks. Guess I need to work on balancing with more veggies. </p>
<p> ….I’ve been addicted to fruit all my life, and have grown up in a family with super healthy eating habits, where my fruit craze was frowned upon. I was always told to keep it down to 2 a day, which felt like a cruel and unusual punishment. Even today (i’m in my 40’s), after years and kids, I still cannot bring myself to eat less than 4 servings each day, and enjoy my morning smoothies like the smokers enjoy their first cigarette of the day. I’ve noticed though that it really doesn’t help the weight loss efforts, and it also doesn’t help my sugar cravings. If left to my own devices, my diet would be 80% fruit and the rest raw or steamed veggies, nuts, grains, the occasional soft-boiled egg and dairy (mostly yoghurt and kefir). One of the side-effects that has always bothered me the most is the bloating and the stomach aches, most prominent after eating tropical fruits (that I adore) like papaya and pineapple, or oranges; also, apples always make me soooo hungry! I wish you all good luck in your attempts to keep fruit from taking over your life :). </p>
<p> I’ve heard that people often crave foods containing nutrients their bodies can’t digest properly. In other words, their bodies are trying to get the nutrients by binging on the foods that contain them. Is that true? For instance, since childhood, I’ve always eaten tons of grapes. I wonder if it’s due to fructose malabsorption? </p>
<p> For the past few months or so I’ve been having a brunch of around 4-6 serves of sub-acidic and acidic fruit every day. Also over the past few months I’ve needed more sleep than before, and if I sit down to meditate I often start feeling sleepy or even going into micro-sleeps soon after! This is not ideal, disruption to meditation and requiring more sleep is undesirable. A week or so ago I was lying down for a while, and when I got up I started feeling faint and almost collapsed to the floor, getting a blackout. My zinc was low several months ago, but since I started taking zinc tablets it has been good. I got a blood test in early August, and my iron, vitamin B12, and vitamin D levels were low. I’ve been taking supplements since then. Recently I tested the acidity of my saliva—it was 6.4. I was also having a banana, six dates, and a handful of sultanas every morning. Now I’ve cut back and instead of having that for breakfast I have porridge with six dates, and occasionally a banana. I may still adjust to reduce my fruit intake and see how that goes. </p>
<p> I haven’t been experiencing any of the signs above, but the oversleeping and faintness is a big concern. </p>
<p> “Potassium is easily found in avocados, chard, mushrooms and kale, vitamin C in raw broccoli, bell peppers and tomatoes, and antioxidants are abundant in all vegetables, but especially the green and leafy variety.” Avocados, bell peppers, and tomatoes are all fruits, not vegetables. We tend to eat them more like a vegetable than a fruit because they are not as sweet, and the latter two are only mildly acidic. I get plenty of exercise and am slightly underweight, so fruit intake is not a concern for me in terms of weight. </p>
<p> What a great article, my weight was coming off slowly couldn’t understand why, very healthy walk for 12 hours a week my diet contains no fat and little carbohydrate or at least so I thought. It was my mum that said and may I quote this just rolled off her tongue your fruit intake is way to much its just pure sugar, my reply rubbish fruit is good for you and low fat. How wrong was I , mums know best. I have since stopped my fruit just to see what happens. Not only have I lost 3lb in two weeks but my stomach doesn’t hurt anymore. </p>
<p> Hi Lily, just came across your website. I’m literally fascinated with this article. I have eaten (now I think) too much fruit for the last few years. Since the birth of my 2 children I decided it was time I lost some weight. I reduced my portions and carb intake dramatically but carried on eating the same amount of fruit as before. No wonder I have hardly lost weight. It’s been very frustrating. I am so glad I came across this article. I think now I have a plan! thank you </p>
<p> Firstly I craved any kind of olives I ate them by the catering tin, each day, and not a lot else, for months and months. Suddenly I stopped. Instead I ate 5 X 4 pun nets if necturines a day. Plus strawberries. At this time I became anemic breathless, pale skin, white in bottom of eyes. I spoke to pharmacist and asked what he could give me as didn’t want to visit doctors. He recommended iron tablets and said you need to take a vitamin supplement C so the iron absorbed into your system. I explained I was craving necturines he said you don’t need the Vit Suppl. then. I took a B supplement instead. After 24hours I was I was no longer breathless. I am not taking the iron anymore but do crave necturines cold hard one after another. I feel very bloated and cannot loose weight as you suggested in you write up, thank you for writing the facts I am now going to cut them out or reduce to just 2 a day. </p>
<p> I have been operated for cancer in 2014, and I and not able to swollow whole foods. I have to make smoothies. I am taking around 3000 calories a day so I don’t lose more weight. I weight 182lbs before my operation now I weigh 145lbs and I am not able to gain weight. There is no vegi in my smoothies and I use 3 bananas, 2avocados, kiwis,walnuts, chia, milk and use ”RAW MEAL” from (garden of life)and UDO’s oil 3-6-9. each day. Can you help me organize my meals so they can be best for me? thank you 🙂 Pierre </p>
<p> You mention to eat more vegetables like avocado, bell peppers and tomatoes, but those are all fruit. Are we supposed to treat them like vegetables like most people assume them to be? And if yes, is that because they are not particularity sweet? </p>
<p> Yes, for the purpose of this article, I’m referring to the types of fruit that are rich in natural sugars (rather than the botanical definition). </p>
<p> Very insightful article. I began eating one bowl or fruits(mixed bowl) everyday for breakfast assuming that fruits are super healthy and best breakfast to eat and was bloated all the time. For a really long time I couldn’t figure out if it was my tummy which was spoilt or if it was some other reason. Eventually on thinking hard, I realized that the one thing common for 2 months that I was super bloated was that I was having fruits on empty stomach for breakfast. That’s when I started exploring some articles and found this. Thanks for the explaination and I am disappointed in these tasty fruits and my ability to digest them.:( </p>
<p> Hi Lily, interesting article and I am going to act on it! I have been attending a well known slimming group for longer than I car to remember and had moderate success. Just a stone and a half from target ….I am maintaining week after week. I feel very patronised when people question whether I have at least 1/3 of a certain type of food etc. Yes I do….in fact more like 2/3 but much of that is fruit…..all types. I graze all day in fruit. In my kitchen I always have an overflowing fruit bowl and as I walk by, I pick a pear or orange etc. It’s habit. Now the slimming group says that’s fine…..I should still lose…..but nothing is happening, in fact last week I gained a lb! I am going to cut the fruit to a couple of portions a day and replace with more vegetables to snack if needs be. Thank you </p>
<p> Great article! I gave up all the bad foods 10 months ago. I have lost 50 pounds without ever being hungry! I eat as much as I want! Of course, my diet is fruits, nuts, lean proteins and lots of veggies. I eat my fruits to get maximum benefit. 4 or 5 small meals a day. I Start with Bran cereal and grapefruit. Some healthy snacks and a few sandwiches for lunch. Dinner is typically fish with a large salad. I do allow myself to indulge on Sundays to minimize the cravings. Although I will eat whatever I crave on Sunday, I find myself not over indulging. I will eat pizza if I want. Also, I do have a sweet tooth! I started exercising about 2 months into the diet. By that point I had lost almost 30 pounds. Losing the weight first motivates you to work out! It really is all about the diet though. You can’t outrun a bad diet! </p>
<p> so that’s why I don’t loose weight: 2 bananas, 2 apples, 2-3 clementine’s or a medium sized grape and some nuts per day are to much. I will reduce my fruit intake, maybe I’ll loose the bloating to! Thanks! </p>
<p> Thanks, this was helpful. 1,3,4 and 5 are very very truetrue for me and I eat 5-7 pieces of fruit a day </p>
<p> hello Lily, I have been operated for right manibule cancer and two ganglion on the right side of the neck in august 2014. I am not able to swollow whole foods. I have lost all my fat. So I started to pump iron to put on some weight. I ve been eatting smoothies that contain 1 banana, 1 kiwi, 1 avacado, spinach, frozen berries, pumpkin seeds, nuts, and use powder proteins Now I got a juicer and juicing my vegis and drink one cup of this vegi juice plus my smoothie, I would like to know how much of the vegi juice should I drink? Thankyou in advance. Pierre 🙂 </p>
<p> This is complete bs, when you cut out processed foods from your diet and have a meal of the same fruit at once, your body should have no problem digesting “too much fruit”, what I’m saying is fruit is better on an empty stomach and not eating different fruits at once will help too, I had 10 bananas for break fast and i feel great </p>
<p> Hi, I might be eating too much fruit because I really love it and have always had a sweet tooth. I cut out most sweets already and now eat fruits instead. I have chronic constipation and need all the fiber I can get. I have a healthy weight on the low side, 3 kgs away from the underweight category. I eat about 4 pieces of fruit a day, whole. Could I still be overdosing on fructose? If I cut back on fruits, I fear I might lose weight. </p>
<p> Hey hun, I don’t think it’s necessary for you to cut down on your 4 portions of fruit. I think that’s perfectly reasonable for someone who doesn’t indulge in unhealthy sweets. For your constipation maybe try eating watermelon as one of your servings of fruit? Watermelon works wonders on my digestive track and is a great water dense fruit. Or you could try fiber one cereal with some raspberries. I use to have bad constipation problems but as soon as I started eating fiber one cereal (the one that looks like bran and has 14g of fiber per serving), I noticed a huge improvement in my bowel movements and once I started adding raspberries or strawberries with the cereal my body was 100% normal again. The daily intake for fiber for a woman is around 24g so if you aren’t much of a veg person try the cereal but if you like veggies try swapping out some snacks you consume with some leafy greens. Hope all that helps, have a lovely day! 😀 </p>
<p> I have been eating a large bowl of fruit with yogurt every night also kept to a strict diet but only lost 1 lb thid week is this fue to my fruit intake after reading this i think this is the case </p>
<p> I came across this page while searching for answers on this unbearable pain I get from eating fruit. I love halos, strawberries and pineapples. I’m not overweight, but have gained some weight before eating fruit because I started getting lazy over the winter months and now I’m trying to get back to where I was. I really need to shed about ten pounds to be at a comfortable weight. I see everyone speaking about greens and I have a question if I may as what can I do to give them flavor, but not make them unhealthy? Here’s a list of some veggies that I really would be interested in learning how to prepare to enjoy broccoli, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, spinach, zucchini, egg plant, peppers, onions, celery and a few others. These are just some that I know I like but wouldn’t know how to make them without adding tons of butter to make them taste so good so if you can please send me some suggestions. Thank you </p>
<p> Hi Holly, Have you checked out my free ebook: “Veggies: Eat Them Because You Want To, Not Because You Have To”? It teaches you how to make veggies taste good, including recipes. Snag your copy here: http://pilatesnutritionist.com/how-to-make-vegetables-taste-good/ </p>
<p> Thanks so much for the article! I’ve been eating a very fresh and clean diet for a couple years, but fruit has been a large portion of it. I get just as much vegetables, and I incorporate (what I think) a healthy amount of good fats as well, but I’m still slightly paranoid about my blood sugar levels. I do tend to crave the fruit for most of the day, and tend to feel a crash every once in a while, but usually only when I’m sitting at my desk at work and not moving around. That seems to be the only symptom I experience though, the only bowel symptoms I experience is an abundance of gas, but no diarrhea or bloating, and I still don’t have a problem losing weight. But as I said, I’m still paranoid that i may be contributing to high blood sugar levels, any suggestions? Am I just paranoid? </p>
<p> I am on a e foods diet for autoimmune disease and i have had bloating lately along with what seemed like sugar spikes and crashes and cravings. I thought fruit intake in the last couple days might be the answer. Although i think I only get about 3 servings, that may be too much for me. Plantains, apples oranges and bananas are my go to. </p>
<p> You’re spot on! Well it all makes sense now as I have 4 of the 5 symptoms. I love fruit and eat loads all the time approx 40-50% of my intake. I will definitely cut down . It’s a shame because I really do like the tastes of all the different fruits I eat but it’s time to change!! I’ll still eat fruit but not 8am-midnight ha ha. Thank you for the information. </p>
<p> so, i have to say that im in tears right now, again. or like always lately. i just got home from being at the hospital most of the day today as lately, ive had bad pain inbetween my breasts, my stomache area , or heart area. its horrible and nothing helps it go. had it for years and it flairs up now and then but i can t soothe it. also, i think im gluten free but dont work so i cant afford to buy things that are and am forced to eat gluten. then, after getting something for my tummy and coming home i hadnt eaten all day and couldnt wait to just have a bowl full of my favorite fruits of which is all i bought yesterday not having alot of money. ten dollars got me milk and fruit. i ate at six pm. and by eight i was in bowel pain again and thought what the hell. i just got home and didnt eat anything. i also took meds for my migraine of which ive had for fifty years now. i got up in alot of pain and studpid me made a protein shake with milk, tofu, and greens and proteins powder. i thought i should put something in me. thats when the pains hit . i also got the chills like crazy and tried to lay in bed . i was so so cold and thinking, this isnt worth being here. im now 54 and life isnt the same. ive changed so much and cant figure out what to do and how and why anymore. i dont want to literally eat . im always in pain every single day . and i mean pain. ive almost fainted in the washroom having bowel movements from not eating right. hard stools, gas, diarrhea, stomache pains, headaches, etc. i dont go out no more and i cant. with these issues…………..i dont drive and live alone. no help. i just dont understand whats happening to me and why. im scared, depressed, upset, sad, down, hungry, truly fed up, dont want to go out. where to go and what to do. im scared. and protein powders give me tons of gas too. so, now what…………….i wish i had someone to help me really. i mean someone really as i need it as im so down and lost right now. if someone does read this , i hope you find it in your heart to help me as id love nothing more to save my life right now. thank you. kari………………xo </p>
<p> I’ve had very little fruit the past three or four days and it’s because I’m hardly thriving on it and actually feel pretty unhealthy with several issues. The reason I would eat fruit though and I do mean eat not drink is to get the fiber and help my bowels move but they’ve been sluggish quite a bit. But for the last three days it’s been getting better and yet I still don’t feel the way I’d like but it’s an improvement. Actually instead of constantly trying to eat healthy I’ve just had more tea and “regular” foods. And I’ll continue but I also would like to add more dairy back into my diet (I haven’t drank any milk for about a week) but I think it conflicts with the fruit or something because I know that makes me feel full more quickly. The thing is a few months ago I could feel it helping but I was spacing out my meals, eating fruit, and drinking milk between 5am and 8-9pm plus other healthy things. And I’m not even overweight so that is not one of my issues. So by not eating as much fruit and getting more water will that help? That’s the only reason I think I’m not feeling a lot worse right now. </p>
<p> My husband was always telling me that I was eating too much fruit but I ignored him because if fruit is good for me more fruit would be better, right? Well no!! 2 weeks ago I was really ill for a day and reading your blog about not being able to digest fructose it all made sense. I was eating 2 huge bowls of fruit twice a day. Although I kept strictly to my diet I still wasn’t losing weight, now I know why!! Since I was ill I have really cut down on the fruit, I don’t feel bloated at all and the weight has started coming off again. Thankyou soooo much for helping me understand that fruit is good but now only 2/3 portions a day is my limit. </p>
<p> Oh my gosh. My usual breakfast used to be a latte and a pack of Brevita cocoa biscuits. I go the gym a lot and thought my body needed better nutrition to support my gym programming. I’ve been having a smoothie every morning with banana, peach, guava, blueberries, Greek yogurt, chia seeds and coconut water but the cramps are just wasting me. I want to continue with my smoothies but I can’t see how I can operate with these vile cramps. Please can you advise me of some smoothie recipes that are stomach friendly. Thank you. Loved the article. </p>
<p> Ooo yes, definately! I have about 10 portions of fruit per day and can’t seem to lose weight. I seem to be carrying the extra around my middle. I shall have a go at a celery stick or carrot as a snack instead. Thank you. </p>
<p> Definitely the stone unturned here! I still point the kids towards fruit snack rather than chocolate and they are getting a taste for nuts now. They no longer ask me for chocolate when they get in from school – result! </p>
<p> I am a member of FA. Everyone else in the program is losing tremendous amounts of weight. I am not. </p>
<p> Typically, my food plan includes 1 large banana each morning and one large orange for lunch. </p>
<p> The problem: I want more, more, more fruit. </p>
<p> During this past week I decided to completely eliminate fruit from my diet and instead have vegetables (squash, green beans, cabbage, broccoli). </p>
<p> I feel soooo much better. My cravings are gone. I have more energy. </p>
<p> Please tell me it is alright to eliminate fruit and instead eat vegetables. Thanks. </p>
<p> I don’t see why that would be a problem, especially since you feel better eating that way. Do what works for you, Sarah. </p>
<p> i never looked at it this way (eating lots of fruits not good) while growing up i was told eating lots of fruits was in fact good for you. reading this i can now understand my blotting situation lol… i find it hard to loose weight even though i think i eat healthy. now i know i am consuming too much fruits. i usually have approximately 15-20 portion per day… lol this is not funny. i actually think i was eating health… this explains my constant hunger for more fruits… i spend 50 pounds per week just on fruits for my self… very sad indeed… thanks for your input it has been very informative </p>
<p> I am /was eating, and had been till now on average, at worse 5 punnet of nectarines a day plus 2 x big pkts strawberries for ever, not much else. Before the fruit craze buckets of green queen olives. Which fruit took over from. I’m anemic when getting iron tablets from chemist he said take a vitamin C supplement to help the iron absorb. I didn’t because of all in C in fruit. I wonder when I have been eating so much fruit and not eating much else if it’s ???? Off any iron in my system and left me anemic. I don’t drink alcohol I drink mainly fizzy water. Gone off tea maybe have 1 coffee day don’t drink soda. So your write up makes perfect sense, especially about the weight. and craving more fruit. I’m 65 12st 3lbs. 5’0″ and notice a big difference when I leave fruit alone for even a day. Thank you for your advice. Joy </p>
<p> My husband and I could not figure out why we still couldn’t lose weight around our mid area and I happened to ask maybe we eat too much fruit and we googled you and found your article, so we are going to try to cut it back as you suggested….. two years ago I went on Juice Plus complete Shake it is all plant protein and I was able to cut 4 and 1/2 inches off my waist and now I can understand by reading your article how that worked for me…. so I am a distributor of juice plus and I’m going to go back and order my shakes again, today …. it did curb my sugar craving when I drank those, made it a lot easier to handle the highs and lows, I should never have stopped the expense is worth it because I put the weight back on in my mid area and thought I had cut back on all the stuff that was doing that, but I was wrong. So thank you for the info! </p>
<p> I’ve been having severe toothache lately which which makes chewing literally a living hell. So I decided to go “smoothie” until my appointment with my dentist (which is next week). </p>
<p> And I’ve been blending a mixture of Apple, Pineapple, Mango, Watermelon, Papaya and Bananas. </p>
<p> Reading your post is really insightful but where do I go from here till when I’m able to fix my aching tooth? I love my daily fruits.. </p>
<p> I have struggled with my weight most of my adult life! Abuse, 6 kids and a sweet tooth and no self control…have been the main culprits. And now i cant seem to shake natural sugar or meat. Seems it has come down to that. All of the above are true except maybe number 2. I just spent money and bought conventional meats, and the swicthed again over to raw fruits and vegtables…and the fruit is killing me, I know its too much, I can go all day and just eat fruit. When iI think of eating just vegtables…I want to curl up in a ball…I want meat, veggies, fruits and some fun foods like nuts seeds raw honey, dates, raw dairy etc and the like. Problem is I need to be a normal weight. My problem…if i eat too much fruit or pasturized dairy it seems my feet begin to pain me. My choices…paleo orsomethimg similiar in the long term, the Daniel diet…without grains beans nuts and seeds in the short term etc . I need no or low inflamation foods and grass fed meats and eggs and raw dairy. Right now ive made a year long committment to the Daniel diet and so I need help with that. How to eat vegtables only or mostly and be satisfied. Very little real sugar and most organic…and/ or raw dairy and grass fed in the end. Thank you for your time. Desperation, Pamela 3602232333 </p>
<p> Hey awesome post you have there! Okay so I’m underweight & now been struggling in putting on weight. So you get the picture right, I snack on fruits most of the time since i am on a SIBO / low fodmap diet; this diet only allows me to eat fruits with higher glucose than its fructose content. And these days my tummy bloats and could this fruit-munching habit be the trigger? And oh ya! You mentioned about fructose causing all those sorts of things. Is it possible for a higher glucose ratio fruit cause this problem as well? Much love from Malaysia, thank you! </p>
<p> Hi…gosh..I’ve been eating salads and fruit for lunch for over a year..my weight has increased…today…so so bloated. ..very uncomfortable. Just couldn’t think what I was doing wrong. .wondered could I be eating too much salad and fruit…put that same question into Google and your article came up.. Going to re think my food intake..feel quite ill at mo…just want the bloating to settle </p>
<p> I am 64. I exercise three days a week and walk two. In the morning I have egg whites, a sweet potato , a kiwi, handful of blueberries and two strawberries. At lunch I make a smoothie with fresh frozen blueberry, strawberry, raspberry. kale, spinach the package says it has 9gr of sugar and I top it off with broccoli. That is it for the day for fruit. We have a spinach salad and fish for dinner. I am in pretty good shape except I have a small gut I can not seem to loose. I have no other problems that you mentioned. Does this look like I am eating too much fruit? </p>
<p> Story of my life: Eat fruits till I can’t move! I have a fruit addiction! Can eat them for lunch,dinner and breakfast! Trying to get out of this habit. I am constantly craving sugar (and only if they are in whole fruit form), and I do multiple servings per day ( my lunch and my dinner are fruits… anything else is a small side dish). So yes, I am 140 lbs, with an aim of 130 lbs, I am a super “healthy” eater…( as defined by society), but a very unhealthy eater otherwise( fruit only!!!and very little of anything else…diabetes alert!!). </p>
<p> Hi! I am wondering if before or after a workout you can allow yourself to be a little heavier on the fruits to refill the glycogene reserve used during a high intensity workout. I usually love having a fruit smouthie before a workout but I realized after reading the article that I might have some difficulty digesting the fructose. Is there an alternative I could turn to while keeping my smouthie before workout habit? </p>
<p> I quote “What’s a reasonable amount of fruit to eat in a day? In general – and unless you’re following a very low carbohydrate diet – I suggest 2 portions of fruit daily,” </p>
<p> If I am on an extra low carbohydrate diet (meat,vegetable,fruit, water and salt). What portion would suggest for me. </p>
<p> Wow. This makes perfect sense and I have recently began running 4 times a week and yet have put ON weight! Eat mega amounts of fruit so going to try to this! </p>
<p> I’ve just stumbled across this page after over hauling my diet. Having not touched fruit for years, except maybe pineapple on a pizza, I have just had fruit for breakfast and a huge smoothie for lunch. I am now sat here with the most wicked stomach cramps I have ever had. (Apart from Labour pains!) After reading the information on this page I think I have over done the fruit intake! </p>
<p> I’ve been smashing an apple, a banana, a peach, a couple of carrots and usually a handful of grapes at work, plus adding blueberries to my weetabix in the morning, and I’ve been feeling quite smug about it. Time to rethink! This was really interesting to read and I’ll make up more of my 5-a-day or 7-a-day or whatever it is now with vegetables from now on. Thanks for writing! </p>
<p> Quite the opposite for me. I eat mostly raw now with one cooked meal per day on the average. Fruit is the basis of my every day meals. I trimmed down fat quite quickly, and have never had so much energy in my entire life. In fact the doctor was diagnosing me with fibro just a year ago. That is when I decided to go all plant based. I was still having issues with my energy levels and that’s when I went raw. Just recently I have upped my protein intake a little to better accommodate my bodybuilding lifestyle. </p>
<p> If you are gaining weight on fruit then you might be ingesting too much of it!! One only needs to cut the portions down a little, and keep your total calories at a level to sustain your own lifestyle. </p>
<p> Oh this is fantastic reading I have been eatin loads of fruit and then later on been cravin chocolate and bread </p>
<p> Hi I have been suffering with headaches every morning I wake up with one.I have been eating lots of fruit more than 5 -7portions daily sometimes more. I have a lot for breakfast and then some after my evening meal. Maybe this is why I am getting mussy headaches daily.I am going to cut down on fruit intake and replace with more veg to see if it makes any difference. </p>
<p> I finally got it. have really bad habit of eating too much fruit it raised my a1c from 5.9 to 6.4 Was eating 4 apples and 3 oranges a day. Maybe. My brother had cancer and the Rd said to me , “do you eat healthy” ” well heck yeah i do” Humm I told her i eat fruit fruit fruit. she said that is simple sugar, not healthy.. Omg. so i cut to 2 small plums and an apple a day. </p>
<p> Hi Lily…Since October last year I have cut out all added sugar and sweetneras the only grain I eat is a small portion of oats( I don’t do any other breads or rice or patatos) I do eat meat and lots of vegetables. I lost quite a bit of weight and I am now 3kgs away from my goal….fruit have been a very big part of my diet…my go to in any situation…and I realised this past weekend that I was able to eat the right portions of veg and protein and some fat but somehow have given fruit a free for all….so since Sunday I have had no fruit….and this morning I came crushing down….I was so dizzy and lightheaded that I couldn’t get out of bed and had a massive headache….Have you come across such a response when cutting out fruit?? I honestly didn’t expect it as fruit was the only real sugar left in my dieet….Thank you for the great article. Regards to everyone. </p>
<p> It’s possible that your carb intake has gone down enough to put you into ketosis. Headaches are a common response when your body is initially adjusting. Look up “keto flu.” (By the way, here’s more info on a ketogenic diet if you’re curious.) </p>
<p> Hello,my name isRodney? I eat my protein,carb and oil err meal, carb being a fruit. I am a carpenter so exert a lot of energy and sweat all day till I roll up. and I feel myself crashing throughout the day. being a carpenter and being me I give 110% out there in the heat in the cold whatever the weather, what would be my best carb throughout the day .I take the allowed amount of protein every serving I take a tablespoon of oil but my choice of carbs is fruit and I’ve been abiding by the Paleo Diet can you help me out can you give me some guidelines on what to eat thank you. </p>
<p> I read a thing on pineapple eating to much cued give you problems’ so you have to be careful on how much you eat </p>
<p> This is definitely me. I have made all the healthy habits changes amd still feel dreadful and my liver is miserable. (Non alcoholic fatty liver). I live on fruit. And I know it’s too much, but I am so addicted and don’t know how to stop! </p>
<p> Thank you for this information. Yes, I am a fruit eater, my whole life! And so do eat green smoothies fairly often. I could exist on fruit alone if I don’t focus on eating something else. I am also vegan, and am trying to eat more balanced meals, without so many carbs. We will eat too much tortilla, bread, and potato otherwise. How does one eat no meat, no dairy, low carb AND low fruit? I would only be eating veges. I love veges but they don’t fill me up enough. Thanks! </p>
<p> Hi, after reading your post my sister now stops her children from eating 5 servings of fruit a day and only allows 2 now. She has replaced the other 3 serves of fruit with ice cream, chips and biscuits thinking that the less serves of fruit is healthier for them. She is not understanding that it’s healthier for the kids to have the 5 serves of fruit than replacing them with junk food. </p>
<p> I’m disappointed to hear that, Vincent. Clearly the intent of the article is to shift the balance from eating excessive quantities of fruit to eating more veggies. Displacing fruit with processed or high-sugar foods is something I obviously don’t condone. </p>
<p> I searched ‘can you eat too much fruit’ and found this article. I followed a very strict protocol of clean, no processed foods, took out the food toxic to my body, particularly to my thyroid and fed my body all the good nutrition it needed about four years ago. I got control of my hyperthyroidism and they didn’t radiate my thyroid (which they wanted to do). After that success, I kept up having vegetable juice for breakfast, smoothie for lunch and a regular dinner. I’m celiac so didn’t have gluten. I had a lot of migraines, mostly not the classic headaches I used to get, but still had migraine eye lights and flashes at least twice a day average. I since found that salicylates in foods caused the ‘migraine eyes’. These include greens like kale, spinach, chard, almonds, teas including green teas, too much coconut oil, blueberries. You can imagine how this changed my diet to more fruit. I am now sure that too much fruit is making me very fatigued, but you can see the dilemma I am in. I regularly try these healthy foods one at a time, but very soon begin to get the migraines again. I would have had about a half a bucket of greens in my large juice for breakfast, so probably overdid it! Any ideas? </p>
<p> Thanks so much for this. I’m very hopeful. I too had given up making bone broth for the last six months. Very interesting </p>
<p> As soon as you illiminated the blame from bread (highly refined) wheat products, I must completely ignore any credibility within your article… Because the true fact is wheat products are more of a blame than fruits will ever be… </p>
<p> Please help me understand where I “eliminate the blame from bread.” Nowhere in the 200+ articles on this site do I advocate for the consumption of wheat. </p>
<p> Glad I came across this article. Over the past year I have changed my lifestyle. Eating better and working out 4-5 times a week. Yes I have lost weight and feel better but have been feeling bloated a lot lately and cannot lose the belly fat. I definitely eat a lot of fruit! Especially now that it is summer and everything is in season. I could not figure out what was making me bloated all the time so I am going to cut back on the fruit for a week and see if there is a difference. Thanks!!! </p>
<p> Well guess I’m in trouble!!! I eat way to much fruit especially in the summer it’s just to hot to cook and I nibble on fruit all day…I have been doing it for years, so I got a little concerned so I Googled it..well thanks for the info better slow down not a bit but a lot.. </p>
<p> I am 71 years old, 6 foot, quite active for my age, cycling a mile or 2 a day, walking a mile or 2 a day, lift dumbbells 5k in each hand x 80 each day. Sit at the computer quite a lot. Still do strenuous gigs once a fortnight in my blues band. Body in quite good shape, apart from my belly is too big for my own comfort, not enormous, I wear size 34 waist in trousers. I haven’t had alcohol or drugs for over 20 years, but I do have an “addictive personality”. All or nothing type. I have recently stopped all chocolate biscuits and ice-cream, and halved my cheese intake (i was eating half a small packet of choc biscs a day, plus lunchtime cheese and evening ice cream). I now eat a good amount daily, of green vegetables, some wholemeal bread, a bit of cheese, not TOO much, and good balanced fish protein. But here is my worry, I used to eat a couple of apples and a banana a day, but I am now eating as much as a whole punnet of strawberries, a whole cantaloupe melon, 3 or 4 bananas, and an apple or 2 EACH day. I know it’s crazy. I have good body functioning and digestion. But I feel I may well be satisfying a fructose craving that will keep my belly too big and firm, even bloated. Do I have your approval to continue this high fruit intake, or should I get sensible one more time? (I know your answer will be the latter!) </p>
<p> I have not had a diarrhea problem in about a year since I had cut out all snack foods, I can’t have dairy or eggs (I have become lactose intolerant). I restrict how much bread products I eat, if any at all. Today, my husband made me a pineapple pancake. Later, I had a handful of cherries and later I had a small Granny Smith apples. I stood up to put the core in the trash and did NOT make it to the bathroom. I put an adult diaper on for protection. I took an anti-diarrheal, which took about 30 minutes to take effect. So, I am going to make sure to cut my fruit consumption to two PORTIONS a day. Thank you for this info. I plan on following up with my doctor to find out if I have any food allergies. </p>
<p> I have frozen mixed berries & banana with low fat yogurt for breakfast coffee break I have orange, I mostly have salad for lunch with an apple cut up to go with it, after I have melon & pineapple ? </p>
<p> I wonder if im eating too much fruit?i started dieting in early january 2017 and so far have lost almost 6 stone (yes brilliant) but i have constant tummy pains and trouble going to the loo! But what is making me suspicious about the fruit i eat is since around the time or just before? i started my diet i have had a funny throat, i sing but cant as it goes out of tune and as though it is sore (but isnt) this is constant ive had tests for more serious concerns and a camera to check back of throat vocal chords etc, all came back with no problems found thank goodness. But this still leaves me with the same problem and thinking about it thought id investigate the idea of maybe eating too much fruit? i eat apples 2/3 with my bran flakes cereal i have half a banana 8 or so of red grapes, sometimes share a flat peach, plum and sometimes other fruits not necessarily all in one day but still i eat a fair amount in one day. Do you have any thoughts on this please? Vince </p>
<p> I am practically a fruitatarian. I do not suffer from IBS or other bowel disturbances. However I do suffer from muscle cramps which I attribute to hyperkalemia. This symptom is immediately alleviated by a couple of TUMS ( calcium) or a few grains of salt. Fortunately I have chronic low blood pressure ( familial) . I do not eat grains or sugar. </p>
<p> Thanks for this post! I have switched to a bland diet recently and I noticed that I’ve eatin alot of fruit! I had dried fruit too thinking I’m having something a little different but it’s still fruit. My stomach area has been feeling gasy and achey lately. </p>
<p> 1&3 is exactly what I’m experiencing. I recently had a baby and am trying to get my body back by juicing allot both fruits and vegies but can’t seem to loose the weight fast enough. </p>
<p> I eat more than 5 servings (usually like 8-10) of fruits everyday (plus a lot of vegetables but less other carbohydrates). I’m not overweight (168cm tall, ~51kg) but have been suffering from IBS (bloating, gas, constipation) for a few years. I always have dry and sore throat so need to drink liquid constantly and like to eat watery fruits (e.g. Asian pears, dragonfruit, watermelon). Is my diet problematic? </p>
<p> Thanks for this article. I no longer eat refined sugar but I do love my fruit. The problem is I get a lot of headaches. I see an acupuncturist, I do yoga and get plenty of exercise but I still have these headaches. I intuitively think that fruit may be part of the problem. I am willing to experiment and cut back on fruit but it’s not going to be easy!! I crave it. Thanks again. </p>
<p> Several weeks I found a nice blender at an estate sale and decided to get because I had heard a lot talk about how smoothies were the way to go for better health. I started drinking one a day and two on some days. After about a week, my stomach had a bloating sensation. I couldn’t understand what was causing it. A couple of days ago, I got to wondering if maybe I might be over doing it with these smoothies. I was making them with either strawberries and bananas, peaches or pineapples. I got on the internet and googled “can a person eat to much fruit?”. It had several links to choose from. After looking at several of them, yours had the best and the easiest explanation I could find. I had no idea that a person could eat too much fruit in a given amount of time. This sight opened my eyes to a lot of things. Thanks so much for the info you give on here.. I am 63 years old and in good health and want to keep it that way. </p>
<p> I weigh 100 pounds I eat everything healthy and my favourite thing is fruit but my stomach is getting bigger and bigger every year I stopped eating fruit two days ago and I can already see a difference I’ve switched fruit for celery and carrot sticks </p>
<p> We have a large raspberry patch and when they are ripe (now), they are sooooo delicious, I pig out. I have them on cereal, I eat my fill when pick them (every other day) and I have them for dessert after dinner. </p>
<p> However, I noticed the last couple of days that my joints feel sore after eating a handful. I think it is the inflammatory reaction you were talking about. (I have a history of that with some arthritis in my elbows from too much Handball). </p>
<p> I am kind of bummed out that I have to cut back because they are so good when fresh off the plant. </p>
<p> Thank you for sharing. It is good to know that there is a connection…. a potential reason for how I felt. </p>
<p> Might be a dose-response reaction to salicylic acid, not fruit sugar (raspberries are pretty low in sugar overall). Raspberries freeze quite well. Save ’em for later. 😉 </p>
<p> My symptom is i’m farting every five minutes and they smell like i’ve been eating skunks </p>
<p> Ag this has solved my problem thankyou. I have been trying to lose weight now for 6 month via weight watchers and haven’t lost a pound but i eat at least 5 portions of fruit a day. Well not from now on i don’t and I’ll see what happens. Thankyou. </p>
<p> Hello How about eating fruit with yogurt. When is best time to eat yogurt with meals, after meals or before meals or in between with fruit or by itself. Thanks. 🙂 </p>
<p> A Chiropractor told me 4 years ago that fructose does spike your insulin weather a person has diabetes or not. And keeping that number at low level of 70s-80s helps a person loose weight. And I experienced it 2 times. As soon as I had extra fruit in my diet my sugar level spiked over 100 and I’d stoped loosing weight.. when I got strict with myself and only had a few berries every other day or so my insulin level would drop and I start loosing weight again! Not to mention he showed me a slide show of how fructose does affect even sleep because it interferes in the intestine and don’t allow Tryptophan to produce! And he showed me what other doctors discovered how it does convert into fat in our liver! So yes it wasn’t made for us to eat all the time.. our ancestors did not store fruits nor did they have suppermarkets to run to. Even meats weren’t eaten daily. Berries and tons of veggies .. you can never over eat raw veggies. It cleans us out and detox s our body and renews all our cells .. despite people’s ideas that cooked prepared foods are healthy it really isn’t the healthiest.. but technology has made this new generation ! Now try to undo it, smh. I’m just so glad that you wrote this about fruits because the words got to get out there! People need to do more research on what and how they are eating! Good health to all and hope that people put it to the test in their own diets to see the changes that happen!! It’s amazing!!! Thank you again for educating </p>
<p> I switched jobs awhile back and now I drive truck . Since it’s boring, snacking is huge . So I snack on raw veggies, nuts and fruit . Probably 5-7 pieces of fruit each day . I have been gaining a pound or two each month . I’ll need to cut back on fruit and add more veggies. </p>
<p> I started my diet with the shakes lost three stone then I started adding fruit to my diet and stopped loosen anymore weight and I was eating vast amounts over the now I know why I’m really angry about this ad all we got told was eating plenty of fruit but don’t get told what happens when you do. </p>
<p> I eat berries with Greek yoghurt for breakfast and at lunch time another 3 pieces of fruit (banana,mandarin pear, kiwi ) maybe another portion after dinner. I’ve been very bloated. I’ve recently cut out potatoes pasta bread cheese biscuit cake pastry and sugar in my tea and coffee. Only eating brown rice fish and vegetables. Still a bit bloated must be the fruit I think especially after reading this ???? </p>
<p> Doesn’t the fibre content in the fruit void the sugar to some degree I know your buddy doesn’t have to work as hard on digesting the sugar cuz of it and it doesn’t store half the fat as if that fructose wasn’t accompanied by it. Calorie in isn’t always a calorie in 20 grams of fruit sugar isn’t nearly the same as 20 grams a processed sugar can you elaborate on this where I’m wrong cuz I train constantly and only eat fruit before 2 and as snack at night </p>
<p> Yes, fiber slows down how quickly your body digests your meal, and thus how quickly it absorbs sugar. Those who are more active and who maintain a health weight often have more wiggle room in their diet for carbs and thus fruit, since their bodies are more insulin sensitive. Hope that helps. </p>
<p> I’m addicted !!! Love all fruits and from reading this, I’m eating way more then I should. I eat fruit 3 to 4 times a day everyday. You’re right it does make me want more. It’s going to be really hard but now I know I have to cut way back. ???? </p>
<p> So glad I came upon this. Now I know I’m eating way to much fruit. I love all fruit and eat a lot, 3 to 4 times every day. I just can’t stop, the more I eat the more I want. Didn’t think you could eat too much, after reading this now I know better and will have to try to control my intake. Not going to be easy ???? </p>
<p> i think I can relate. Ever since starting a longterm diet for14 years I’ve been eating much more daily fruit. Since starting it I have had serious health problems one after another. From menstruation hemorraging to cancer and a cardiac arrest. It has also cost me a world of problems from loss of a good job, my livelihood, to a disconnect with seeing family. I’m starting to believe the main culprit was too much fruit eating. Since recently cutting way down on it, I’m starting already to notice better changes. I have been praying to figure out the culprit and I believe I have found it. From diarrhea to my stamina, dizziness and other symptoms that had me down and out. Your blog started me to be even more suspicious of fruit. Thank-you!! </p>
<p> Hi. Awesome website and blog. I see your reasoning but I cant agree. I’m a full on fruitarian and I’ve been healed of so many chronic issues, from dermatitis, asthma, sinus issues and the list goes on. Although a lot of this post is useful, it’s not true. I have studied the lymphatic system and a fruit-based diet is designed for our body. I suggest you follow Dr Robert Morse and Jon Stearns. You will be amazed at the benefits of living on a raw living diet that’s primarily fruit based. These are not theories. We are actual people implementing this for years. God bless sis and I hope this helps </p>
<p> It can be useful as detox for a short period of time,but most people experienced health issues if they continually eat Lots of fruit daily, some after weeks or months, some after many years,depence on how much fruit each person can tolerate. I have stories about people with great health living almost solely on fruit suddely getting a lot of health problems and disease, so in the end a balanced diet is definetly the best </p>
<p> I think I am eating too much fruit as I’m so bloated and it’s only recently that noticed I am as I’ve been eating a lot of fruit to lose weight from all the Christmas food that I ate. I have stomach cramps aswell again only noticed recently due to eating lot of fruit and I eat more than 2 or 3 portions of fruit. </p>
<p> Hi. Great article. I have been down the cancer track so have a whole Lemon every morning for the vitamin C, during the afternoon an apple to keep the doctor away and in the evening a Kiwi Fruit to help me in the mornings. I am also a veggyholic. But I do struggle to keep my weight down to 75kg. Am I eating too much fruit? I am 78. Trevor </p>
<p> 2 pieces of fruit (plus a lemon, which has very low amounts of sugar) is perfectly healthy. </p>
<p> You didn’t mention that pectin acts as a cleaner for your intestinal tract, which may cause diarrhea in some people </p>
<p> You also said nothing about gut flora which has a huge effect on digestion. If your gut flora is bad enough for long enough it can cause problems with your small bowel. This includes “leaky gut” which can lead to all sorts of issues. </p>
<p> In general if you have poor gut flora then you can have all sorts of digestion troubles (and a lot of other issues too). </p>
<p> I used to eat a lot of fruit and never had a problem at all. When I had issues with reactive hypoglycemia (which went away when I went organic, how to freak out your endocrinologist) I kept apples in my pockets all the time. I never had any “trots” or bloating or anything. </p>
<p> Then I had a series of infections which required many courses of antibiotics. After this I got Fibro, CFS, etc. Now despite my ongoing work at rebuilding my gut flora with things like all organic kobucha, all organic naturally fermented veggies and Prescipt Assist (a soil based probiotic, as milk based probiotics cannot recolonize the gut. They only stick around about a week) with good results – I still have the trots when I eat fruits now days, and some fruits far more that others. </p>
<p> Plums, Apricots & other stone fruits run right on through me. I know my gut flora is still screwed up. I keep getting infections (the last one was a seriously dangerous Biliary tract infection – it took 2 weeks on 4 different antibiotics to keep it from killing me). </p>
<p> After reading your post I believe I may be eating to much fruit. I have been very bloated recently. I work long hours and often get hungry so grab a piece of fruit. I eat up to 6 pieces a day. What could I eat instead? When I don’t eat I often get shakey working with children in a nursery I need a quick snack. </p>
<p> I have IBS D and have had for many many years. I to eat plenty of fruit. We were away on a cruise and I realised I wasn’t haven’t the usual problems. I then looked at the difference in food I was eating compared to at home. I realised I wasn’t eating much fruit. I’ve since cut out and been so much better. I am trying to introduce a bit of ‘safe’ fruit back what do you suggest grapes? I love them </p>
<p> Thanks for the great read. I can relate to many points above. . I recently began a journey to loose weight believing I need to eat lots of fruit. Which I did and have been doing. Once reading this article I can now see I need to cut back. </p>
<p> Hi. For breakfast I have one banana, for strawberries sliced, hand ful of blueberries, almonds and 1/4 cup whole milk. That is around the fruit I eat. I do eat veggies 50 lbs. Thank u. </p>
<p> Thanks so much for the lesson… Sitting here eating a Barlett Pear and wondering if “there is such a thing as eating too much fruit”… Google it and your post popped up… After reading your article I have to say that #1 is what I identified most… Even while munching more than halfway through my pear while reading, my stomach began grumbling and I started to feel bloated… it was my fourth fruit today… I have drastically changed my diet… past three weeks… cut out all junk food and processed carbs …. This morning I had a banana… at break time I had 1oz of raisins with my oatmeal/ at lunch I had plum and at 3pm break I had a pear. And now, as i’m typing, I feel my eyes getting heavy which is often a sign of my blood sugar dropping… wow… even when you try and do the right things in your diet there another ‘fly-n-the oinment’… Anyway, thanks for the info… I will make some additional changes in my diet going forward… Oh… your suggested fruit pear’ng…(pun 🙂 apples/peanut butter, peach/almonds, and berries/yogurt … is this according to your own tastes or is there a specific purpose for these combinations? I myself like banana/peanut butter… </p>
<p> I eat a medium size container filled with Orange .. purple grapes .. strawberries.. blue berries.. Watermelon everyday at 10am for morning tea is this a more bad or good thing? </p>
<p> I am so glad that I found your website. Unfortunately I found it a little bit too late and I have ingested way over my fair share of fruits. I am constantly bloated, I cannot stop eating, I crave sugar all the time, I am gaining weight, and its overall made me hate fruit but I cannot stop eating it. What do you suggest that I do? I have tried to start my mornings with hot lemon water and drink green tea later during the day , Ive started to eat chobani Greek yogurt — plain of course. Am I supposed to cut out fruit completely from my diet until I feel less bloated? I really want to lose these 10 pounds and I’ve been working out like crazy, I get over 20,000 steps in a day— running, walking, playing basketball—nothing seems to work, please help!! </p>
<p> i think im eating too much fruit, sometimes i eat up to 3 clementines and an apple a day, if not something of that sort, but at least 2 fruits per day. Orange, apple and clementines are my main, i just don’t understand how much is too much and if i shouldnt be eating that much then to what do i switch it too ? i want to lose weight not gain it. </p>
<p> Very interesting read. Suffering from bloating and stomach cramps, I’ve recognized I’m eating a lot of fruit which could be the cause of the symptoms. Will reduce intake and see what happens. </p>
<p> I love fruit – I could live on fruit! But this year, I decided to give WW a try and lucky for me, I could eat all the fruit I wanted!!!! And I did! A lot of foods I eat are not high in calories, I like to use MFP, but they have points in WW. Except for fruit! So for 5-6 Weeks I used the WW advise and rules! I lost weight, but only 3-4 lbs in the first 4 weeks! </p>
<p> I decided to compare WW to calories, and I was able to stay in the 1300-1500 range. Not enough to lose much weight, but with my exercising I do, I did lose one lb a week, but I did eat 2-3 c of fruit a day! That sure adds up calories, and MFP tells me I’m over my sugar amount everyday! </p>
<p> The last few days I’ve been having pains in my stomach, especially at night. It’s horrible to have that at night, so I looked this up here – and you explained, very well, thank you, what I’ve been doing wrong! I’m going to try to stay at 1 cup a day. But I bet I’ll hit 2 a few times. Hopefully that stomach aching will go away! If you have any other advice for me, I’d really appreciate it! </p>
<p> I’m doing Pilates too – I wish I could stretch and hold legs up better, like a I did a “few” years ago! But it is helping stretch out muscles I don’t use enough these days! Thank you! </p>
<p> I work night shift and normally have a punnet of easy peal oranges, I have half the punnet with my half sandwich which is ham Chinese leaf and seed sensation bread, sometimes it feels like I crash for energy after eating, should I be eating less fruit? </p>
<p> Yup. On vacation. Drank 2.5 fresh mango smoothies yesterday. Woke up nauseous, bloating and had diarrhea this morning. Lesson learned. Definitely eating rice today. </p>
<p> This article is spot on for me! Although I am very, very active and not overweight at all I struggle with cravings and constantly being hungry. Eating more than a couple of servings of fruit per day sends my sugar cravings through the roof! I did a 7 day total sugar detox (I even cut out sweet potatoes!) and it opened my eyes. My appetite stabilized and my cravings were reduced in a huge way. As a vegan I can easily eat 4 bananas in one sitting, but that will never happen again. I do blend 1/2 of a banana in my whole-foods based protein shake in the morning, but it’s full of fatty coconut cream and pea protein so it doesn’t send my blood sugar skyrocketing. Thanks for putting this together! </p>
<p> This IS literally a GODSEND to read right now!!!!! I got on the scale this morning hoping to see the numbers change. I have been eating excellent, maintaining about a 1500 calorie day with nuts, greens, salmon, chicken, veggies, aaaaand FRUIT! I usually have more than I probably pay attention to with additions to my cereal and snacking clementine while jogging the 5 mile Prairie I do everyday (did I mention EVERY DAY ha ha) aaaaaaand so when I get on the scale and I see NOOOOOOO budge on the scale? I was discouraged and perplexed and deciding about whether to just go and get a whole pizza to chomp on and drown my sorrows on that sad sight (although at this point I would pay for that choice….my stomach now cannot digest anything packaged or digested). </p>
<p> Soooooo the only thing that I could question was the fruit intake because I know it is a lot and I’m not too educated on the carbs/insulin production. Although for me, I am insulin resistant and actually take Metformin each day so I have no idea what bearing that has on my body and the fruit intake. I know I drink coffee and a lot of tea to get my energy levels up there to go to the Konza Prairie to jog that 5 mile trail that has tedious inclines and is a joyful workout that gives me a well rounded addition to my healthy lifestyle. I just can’t believe that the scale hasn’t budged in 2 weeks! I should have lost at least 4 or 5 pounds by now!!! My older sister said my body can’t sustain me biking 30 miles (which I also do) on 1500 calories because my thyroid will go haywire. I guess I’m scared to know what I’m doing to my body when I’m thinking I’m doing everything right with plenty of fruit and veggies!! </p>
<p> But thank you so so much for this read! I KNOW that I solved at least one of my main issues! I need to cut it out to just the small handful of blue berries that I keep for my noosa yogurt or cottage cheese ???? </p>
<p> Thank you again! Any feedback will be much appreciated ❤️ </p>
<p> Lily, thanks for an informative article. It’s number 3 for me. I am eating well over what I should at every meal and slowly have put in weight. Better re organise my diet. </p>
<p> Wow this article spoke to me. I absolutely loved it . Very well written. I’ll be honest, I hardly ever read long articles but This one grabbed me. Thank You ???????? </p>
<p> Do not have problems 1-5. Been told “eat fruit alone or leave it alone”. Combining rules. </p>
<p> Not true? Really interested because I feel the need for fat with it, nuts or cream. Eat3-;5 servings a day.restrict to low sugar fruits. Am I ok? </p>
<p> 70, 5 2, 105 lbs.,woman. Rest of diet mostly veggies and all the good stuff. But do well on higher fruit than most this ok? </p>
<p> I’m like addicted to fruit i can’t get away from it especially in summer all the nectarines, peaches, berry’s , mangos and ect i just don’t know how to get away from them i pretty much switched the fruit and vegetables servings 5 fruit 2 vegetables it works for me but i can’t get all the energy from the fruits out of my body cause i don’t do a lot of exercise. Beats me though i love fruit </p>
<p> I am dealing with being bloated to the point that my period cramps keep me in bed sleeping all day! I also deal with diarrhea every 3-4 days. </p>
<p> I recently joined weight watchers and Fruits and Veggies are free points. And fruits are easier to keep on the car because I am a dog walker and have to drive all over Madison WI. </p>
<p> Any suggestions on ways to keep veggies and dip cool in the car when it’s 80* outside? Or other good recipes for the car in the summer? </p>
<p> Hello! Oh my! I know I have been consuming too much fruit . I drink a smoothie every night packed with 2 cups of frozen strawberries, one banana, half of an avocado, 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt, and about a cup and 1/2 of pineapple. I drank one every night as a meal replacement for the past year. My husband, who is into eating well and exercising has been telling me how unhealthy my smoothies are for a long time. I thought he was wrong but now understand that it was me who was dead wrong. Thank you for this information. </p>
<p> Wow I never gave it a thought about eating too much fruit but reading this I understand now why I feel bloated and even when I’ve been to the toilet I never fell completely empty ( sorry) . I eat loads of fruit a day ,apple,pears, oranges,grapes,pears etc. I will definitely cut my fruit down . Thank you </p>
<p> I’m very fortunate to have found your information on toooo much fruit intake. After 4 months of being hooked on a daily “fruit” smoothie, I have developed a rash on my upper chest. I’m not sure the smoothie is the cause, but I am stopping the fruit smoothie for awhile to see if that is the cause. Here was my fruit mixture ( done in a blender): Almond milk, 1 banana, 1 apple, 1 cup frozen blueberries, a few strawberries, and half of a pear. Oh, and I would put honey on my morning cereal. After reading your article, that is way tooooo much fructose. I wished I had researched this 4 months ago. </p>
<p> Although your intentions are good, and I did enjoy reading your article. I think you should preface your thoughts as just that, unsubstantiated thoughts. Although some of your article is backed up by “science” you use it to fit a personal narrative that is slightly misleading. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe you are basing this on the review published in “Nutrition,” where researchers at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland said that when fructose is consumed in excessive amounts as part of a high calorie diet, can contribute to development of metabolic syndrome. Which agains is a very misleading statement. I can explain more offline as I’m not here to bash you in any way. Just to give people an alternative opinion also based in science and experience. All the best TEAM FRUIT </p>
<p> Hi, I’ve had a problem with rating wayyyy too much fruit because I crave fruit all the time. I eat nothing but healthy food so I’ve always thought you can’t eat too much fruit. In a day I’ll eat 10-14 apples, and a huge bowl of grapes. I thought this was fine but after reading this I know it isn’t. It’s just so hard for me to stop eating fruit because I crave it all the time and I’m always hungry so fruit is an easy go-to for me. I need help to stop eating all this fruit, do you have any suggestions? </p>
<p> Hi Lilly! Thank you so much for your article! It was very informative and has answered a few questions for me. I have been vegan for a few years now but this last year or so i have been drifting more and more towards fruit as my staple diet. Your article has been very good in explaining to me what is going on inside my tummy as i have been having more and more difficulties recently and now i think i know the culpret! I will be downloading your ebook and trying a few of the recepies! Thank you again for the article! </p>
<p> I have every sign that I’m eating too much fruit… Glad I read this…. I need to know the healthiest way to eat a high alkaline diet with the right combination of fruits veggies and nuts. .. I started this diet because I read where it helps my Adderall absorb better… I was eating and drinking all the wrong stuff and could not get the full benefits of my med.. when I first started all the fruits high in akaline, I felt the med work better and longer but now… not so much and I’m tired more.. I want to eventually cut out the med and rely on my food and vitamin to help energy and add…. any suggestions </p>
<p> I just ate 3 very ripe banana and an apple. I would have had more but that was all that was in the house! LOL </p>
<p> I decided to go ‘low carb’ about 6 weeks ago. For me that meant no bread or crackers beyond 1 thin slice of “Dave’s Killer” whole grain bread for breakfast. It also meant no pizza crust & no potatoes or high carb fruits (apricots & my beloved bananas, etc.) I’ve never had much of a taste for meat, so I’m not filling the gaps with steak. I have grilled chicken breast a few times a week & thinly sliced turkey breast once in a while. Mostly I have an appetite for nuts, berries + greek yogurt, watermelon, guacamole, cheese & olives. (I do celery sticks & broccoli with hummus, too.) I didn’t need to lose a lot of weight – I mainly wanted to stem a slow weight gain. It worked well for me. I lost a few pounds in the first few weeks & about 2 inches in my waist. The biggest surprise is I feel satiated on much less food. The high protein, high fat foods I’m eating really stick with me, too. I also don’t feel bloated anymore. (I think all the afternoon snack crackers were doing that.) I do eat a lot of watermelon – 3-4 cups when I’m in the mood – & it serves as a light meal. I’ve been very happy with my new lifestyle & at 68 it’s nice to be able to eat the foods I enjoy & still keep my ‘girlish’ figure. ps – thanks for your great article! </p>
<p> I eat fruit all day and a meal in tbr evening. I feel fine no problems, just today I started cramping after eating a bowl of mix fruit. </p>
<p> Oh wow this is me! I’m doing slimming world and am struggling to lose more than ½lb a week and I couldn’t figure out why! In SW it is advised to go to fruits as the snack item and I eat so many apples – at least 3 in the evening and as this is a ‘speed’ food I thought I was doing myself a favour but after reading this I’m going to try a week with having veggie-based snacks instead like baby corn, baby sweet peppers and when I was a kid I LOVED getting unshelled fresh peas and sitting, popping them out of their shells and eating them so I’ll be trying those again later! </p>
<p> I cannot tell you how disappointed I am that you are right. All 5 reasons that you listed apply to me. As a matter of fact, I just joined the gym and the personal trainer told me that I was eating too much fruit in a day, thus, having too much sugar. It is really hard for me to get used to this idea of cutting down on fruits, but after reading your post, and having the words of the personal trainer echo in my ears, I must and I will. Thank you for such enlightening information – one that I had heard before but one that has just reinforced what I was told before. </p>
<p> I am vegan and eat very very little refined sugar in any form but I do eat a lot of fruit as my first meal of the day… Probably at least six or more fruits. I have been told I am pre-diabetic and I do have a ton of bloating so I have been wondering if the fruit is causing those two issues and I am finding different answers online about how much fruit is okay to eat ranging from eat just two a day to eat all you want…. </p>
<p> I am having diarrhea especially after eating bing cherries. We have an abundance of raspberries, blueberries, rhubarb and bing cherries. Apples,plums and pears are ripening. And I have irritable bowel syndrome. Oh darn. Thanks for the article. I am not going to be “hating” you any time soon. I am going to check with my doctor who will say that same thing I’m sure. Stop with the fruit. </p>
<p> Today I bought a kilo of fresh ripe apricots. As I have type 2 diabetes I searched for benefits of eating apricots. I already had eaten about half a kilo in addition to 2 peaches and some melon. None of the health-websites or blogs suggested it is bad to eat too many apricots. It is really described as a heavenly fruit with up to 21 fantastic benefits. But i searched more and saw your article. Though I think people are different and so cope or react differently and eating fruit must been taken in the bigger picture of the whole diet, exercises and style of life and eating habits ( as Mediterraneans we eat much more fruit liberally) , still your explanations are useful and I will definitely cut back my fruit portions plus more veg and exercise, </p>
<p> Hello! I’m vegan and I hardly eat any refined sugars but I eat tons of fruit in the morning and I feel great! I guess every body Is different. My children eat tons and tons of fruits with greens and the doctor has told me that they are in good health. In my family we love fruits but we also combine it with greens. I have never had a problem with fruit so far and thankfully I don’t crave sugary stuff. </p>
<p> Just came across your site whilst looking up blackberry benefits. Your site is great. Very pertinant comments and so helpful. I have just made 500grms of blackberries into a smoothie. How much do u suggest i drink a day? I do drink other fruit smoothies including veg and eat lots of nuts too. As i have had heart attacks and and am in poor health i am trying to benefit my cardiovascular system. I am 64. </p>
<p> In the morning I have a cup of coffee and a cup of apple juice, (not processed). An hour later I have 2 cups of blueberries, (whole and raw) 1 whole peach, (Raw) and 12 cherries, (Raw) Then I go for a 3.4 KM walk around the track. </p>
<p> So glad I came across this page! I feel like I’ve been eating a lot of fruit since I started my diet (I am on herbalife, so 2 shakes a day and I have mostly fruit as my last meal). I was worried I was eating too much but it looks just right as I have not exhibited any of the digestive symptoms. Now I know what too look for just in case. Thank you! </p>
<p> Lol thanks for these insightful comments. I’m craving more fruit and now I know I’m over doing it especially with my portions. I love veggies too but fruit is my weakness . I’ve been trying to eat healthier and I see much improvement in the way I feel and weight, but was concerned about my fruit intake . </p>
<p> I recently had a blood test and found that my total cholesterol had gone up to over 7 whereas a year ago it was 5.4. My good cholesterol had dipped to under 1.0. I have been eating much more fruit than I used to and wonder if this could be the reason because of all the sugar. They said that this often happens when people switch to what they think is a healthy diet. </p>
<p> Haha it’s funny to think that people actually believe this crap. It’s not funny however that you go around calling yourself a nutritionist as it’s clear from your article that you have no idea how the human body works. Your only redeeming point was about whole fruit being superior to juice due to the fibre. 2 apples a day as a maximum however, you need to go back to wherever you obtained your ‘nutritionist’ qualification that made you believe carbohydrates hinder weight loss. </p>
<p> To the people worried if they’re eating too much, ask yourself 2 questions; why do humans have hands like the great apes and not hoofs or paws like herbivores and carnivores respectively? To pick fruit? Why do junk food companies make the packets of sweets with bright reds and oranges? To spot ripe fruit? A chimp eats 60% fruit in their diet and they are perfectly healthy in the wild and we share 97% of their DNA. So whatever your diet choice, I highly doubt you’re eating anywhere near enough fruit for it to be problem. </p>
<p> Hi I drink lots of hot water with lemon, as well as loads of fruit! I will cut fruit right down as doing intermittent fasting with what I Thought a really healthy diet but not losing any weight. I exercise at least twice a day too (swim and gym) plus walking 7 miles. As I said I am going to cut down to 2 portions a day but should I cut down on lemon in water? </p>
<p> hell, I identify with all of them except the juice/smoothie one. Thank you; will try something else. </p>
<p> Yes , I munch on fruit all day!! No wonder I’m constipated always and can never lose weight!! I bike, drink lots of water, and make everything homemade, but can’t lose!! This makes a whole lot of sense!! I always blame it on meds or age!! I’ll be changing my diet!! </p>
<p> I think you just solved my biggest mystery!! i am constantly bloated, a painful bloat, and I eat on average two apples a day, a cup of fruit for breakfast and more fruit after work. I don’t eat junk food or much sugar and I exercise daily. I could not figure out for the life of me why I’m bloated all day every single day! I’m going to cut back on my fruit and see if this makes all the difference. Thank you! </p>
<p> Very helpful. Thanks. I am a fruitaholic. Normal workday includes about a half cup blueberries on oatmeal, smoothie for lunch with banana, strawberries, POM juice, chia seeds and fat free yogurt. And sometimes also an apple as a snack. Sounds like I should cut back. Healthy but really do feel bloated and having trouble losing weight. </p>
<p> Hi Lily, Your words of wisdom have really helped open my eyes!! I’ve reached a point in my diet where I am struggling to loose weight, I have cut out all of the rubbish from my diet, but I eat probably around 5 portions of fruit a day (I’ve always taken the calories into account but never really thought too much about the sugar content!). Going to try and swap out some of the fruit I have for vegetables or something similar – if you have any hints on what I could use as a substitute that would be great. Thanks!!! </p>
<p> I’ve been trying to tell my sister she is eating too many strawberries. She consumes at least a quart per day and is having very bad diarrhea. She also eats a lot of ice cream. She doesn’t believe her diet choices are to blame. I’m going to share your article with her. Thank you! </p>
<p> Lily….thank you for this. I LOVE summer fruits and eat mango, paw paw, banana, passionfruit, blueberries, sometimes nectarine and peach. Sometimes a huge bowl of the lot. Consequently I have a marvellous reaction as I also have IBS. Disastrous ! Doctor has told me a fructose overload. Happens mostly all the time but sometimes I can get away with it. Also I eat about 10 veggies smashed together down to one serving which I freeze into separate containers so there’s a good variety but I can manage that every night. It’s the fruit AFTER that that does the damage. </p>
<p> Hi Lily. My son has been taking Juice Plus for about 1 and 1/2 months now and since then he’s been burping constantly, and even had to go to the E.R. with excruciating pain in his upper abdomen and middle back. Do you think J.P. is causing this. The product says that they take out the carbs. They are in pill form. He is also taking Omega 3 in pill form. </p>
<p> Having been to the Gastric Clinic this week with all of the symptoms in your article, it was discussed at the Clinic whether I was eating too much fruit, veg and salad. Already being a coeliac, it is difficult to know what to eat and I am being referred to a dietician. Your article has been very helpful in confirming what we already thought. </p>
<p> I don’t really eat much fruit at home and I don’t have any problems, but being in hospital for the last 2-3 weeks we have fruit with our meals, and due to thirst another apple or orange. Also we have fruit purees. Over the last couple of days I have had severe bloating and pain, so maybe eating maybe 3x the amount of fruit I normally have has caused the symptoms described. Thank you for your imput very helpful. </p>
<p> Hi lily, I totally agree with everything you have said. I believe as a culture we are eating and feed out children way too much fruit. I look after lots of children and the ones who eat a lot of so called healthy food are overweight and often ill whereas the ones who eat more normal type meals with lots of protein, carbs and veggies are healthy and slim and also not so hyper either. On a side note I don’t have Ibs but have ibd (crohns and colitis) and strictures in my small intestine and no large intestine at all. I would love to be able to eat some fruit or veg but struggle with anything. I wondered if you knew which things if any I could try. Maybe there are fruits and vegetables with a very low fibre level? Thanks Lillie </p>
<p> The more fruit I consume the better I seem to do. I will add to my diet greens and protein a few times during the week but I truly benefit from fruit. I find that mixing fruit with other foods tends to bloat me. Especially dairy. I can’t do yogurt or milk with any fruit whatsoever. But by themselves no problem at all. I can’t do smoothies however, they can bloat as well whether its fruit or greens. But chopped or sliced in a bowl over a few days and I’m doing really well. It took me most of my life to realize how bad I was feeling from eating the other carbs like bread and rice etc. Is this a situation of how everybody is different and/or how our make up is different. I find that I can’t even eat spinach. Tendancy to bloat and a feeling of wanting to up chuck. I must say lily you look healthy(cute too) so what your suggesting sure does you justice. The diet topic is in my mind one of the most confusing and controversial hings I’ve ever had to deal with in my life. I appreciate the hashing and brainstorming that goes on. Thanks lily. </p>
<p> thanks,ive joined slimming world and have eaten sooo much fruit. last night i was so bloated and very gassy.today ate more fruit and actually feel sick. im also type 2 diabetic,just didnt realize how bad this was for me. i was believing i would wake up and see the benefits instead i feel fatter. i will definately cut back on the amount.thank you.very helpful xxx </p>
<p> Hi Lily. This article was so informative. It actually scared me a bit because I live in the Caribbean and we have so many species of mangoes. I have been eating so many per day. I realize the more I eat the more I want until I became full. I do IF and had been losing weight until I started my mango binge thinking it was a healthy thing to do until I noticed the pounds creeping back on. Thank you for your candor and factual information. I would definitely reduce my intake based on this information. </p>
<p> I disagree with this article in many ways. I eat 3-5 (sometimes more) servings of fruit per day and it has helped me enormously during my weight loss journey. 6 months ago I was about 55 pounds heavier and replacing junk food with fruit has helped keep me full and satisfied. It is an awesome snack and since overhauling my diet by eating more fruit instead of junk food as well as eating Non-processed foods my digestive issues have almost completely disappeared. Maybe others have noticed different reactions by high fruit consumption but I’m going to keep eating tons of fruit!! 🙂 </p>
<p> I have been overdoing all the dark fruits for months This might be why very soon after eating them (unless with a natural organic porride oats) I get warm and I itch. I will sart to go easy and take up the tip about combiing the fruit with a fat of some kind I do not need to diets as I am right for my hight and age Thank You </p>
<p> Someone else told me this years ago, and it changed my life. You just hear “fruit and veggies are good” for much of your childhood and no one tells you that even good things should be moderated! Now I only eat 2 servings of fruit per day, usually one with breakfast and one as a snack, along with a protein/fat like peanut butter or nuts or an egg or something. It’s made me feel far less bloated and helped me slim down a bit, just with that small change! (I was eating tons of fruit and smoothies before… like a fruit with every meal, a smoothie for breakfast, fruit for snacks, it was too much.) I also mostly avoid bananas and melons except for a little treat. This is all thanks to my mother’s nutritionist’s advice to her, and it’s working for me too! I wish this was more widespread knowledge. Thanks for this article! </p>
<p> Absolutely enjoy fruit but just like any sweet do so as a treat especially if you have digestive and sugar sensitivity like I do! I stick to blueberries which I add with walnuts to my organic oatmeal on a daily basis. The rest of the day I load up on vegetables, nuts, seeds and some protein. It is struggle to stay focused on what works for me even though I wish I could eat more goodies!! </p>
<p> Hi Yesterday I ate a whole red grapefruit followed by cereal with fresh strawberries for breakfast as I always do. Later in the day I ate about 30 big cherries cos I love them. However I woke up 3 times in the night for a poop and have been going every few hours this morning. Could it be the fruit. .? </p>
<p> So i went to china, and ate a TON of fruit, and i feel sick….which is probably the fruit, but could be something else. It’s likely the fruit because i Haven’t eaten anything risky. Ex: multiple dragon fruits,or half of a watermelon, etc a day or more </p>
<p> In all honesty, I see the truth in this article, but only when contrasted against the other factors that could possibly be playing a role here. </p>
<p> Let’s not forget, the type of fruit you eat together is just as important as anything. Mixing the wrong fruits, or even mixing fruits with veggies can cause some undesirable effects on your body. </p>
<p> Meat, as well. If your eating meat, even dairy, and other foods that are just not good for the vitality of a human, you can’t expect the fruit to do the work it needs to. Even the level of hydration someone is at can have a terrible impact on your digestion and overall ability to do anything properly. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, we are all very different in bodily functions. For me, the fruit does wonders on my body in every aspect and is definitely a super strong healer and hydration tool. </p>
<p> I want to know is fruit really bad for u I usually eat like 3 or 4 apples a day is that bad will I get fat someone plz answer </p>
<p> What do you say about Dr. Fuhrman’s ideology? His books say to eat AT LEAST 4 servings of fruit/day, but that there really is no limit. He says the same about non-starchy vegetables as well. </p>
<p> I was wondering why weren’t I losing weight and this article answered my question. #1 AND #3 spoke to me! So, thanks for such an excellent article. I know now to cut my fruit by half at least. I can’t wait to see and feel the difference. </p>
<p> This is a testimonial: Yes, this information was really helpful. I had what drs. described as ABS, and other stomach issues for over 40 yrs. .I decided to go SMOOTHIE. I started with Mango and bananas. onto Kale and spinach, added to the same mix. Experimenting on flavors, like pear and peaches. Yet , I did consume quite a few bananas and mangos, I lost weight and the bloating. The symptoms of ABS disappeared. All in 3 weeks of starting the smoothies. I don’t know how much weight I’ve lost, but my clothes are swimming on me. Now, that I’ve read the article, I will cut back on bananas and add more veggies. I must add, I only use water and protein powders. No dairy. I hope this info. is helpful to someone else. No More IBS… </p>
<p> I just moved back to the states from a few years in the Caribbean and I’ve been going hog-wild for all the stone fruits I couldn’t get in the tropics (not that mango, passion fruit, guava, and papaya are all that bad). And I’ve been scratching my head why I bloat up a pants size by midday, at which point I’ve already had 2-3 servings of of cherries, plums, peaches, and/or nectarines. It’s a scarcity motivator—I know their season will end soon so I must dive in now. Meanwhile, all I want to wear are elastic waistbands. </p>
<p> I have been eating between 4 & 7 pcs. Of fruit every evening for some time now. I do recognize that the hunger pangs or a desire for a cookie is there an hour after the fruit. No digestive problems, still losing weight, have good bowel movements. I do this thinking I would lose more weight and it is healthier. Your article is very interesting… </p>
<p> Everyone of your comments are true for me, I’ve started eating lots of fruits in my diet but am constantly bloated and not losing weight </p>
<p> Huh, that’s interesting. I’m 33, 5’5, and only weigh 99 lbs. The majority of my diet consists of fruit (maybe 75%?). Mostly strawberries, kiwis including Sungold kiwis, grapes, pineapple, oranges, watermelon, bananas, blueberries, blackberries, well, basically I love all fruit, except cantaloupe and raspberries, lol. Anyways, I’m not exactly a healthy eater per say, I’ve never dieted in my life, and have always ate whatever sounds good. Fast food, chocolate, pretty much any sweet, you name it, but luckily, I also love healthy food like fruit, veggies, salmon, avocados, sweet potatoes, etc. and eat them as often as I can, just because I think they’re delicious. I don’t exorcise like I should or drink water like I should (or practically at all), which I often wonder if that’s the reason I crave fruits all day, everyday, and am currently trying to work on drinking more water. But no matter what I eat, I cannot gain weight for the life of me! I’ve been underweight for at least a few years, and am wanting to see a doctor or a nutritionist, but need to get my insurance straightened out first. Thoughts? Thanks for reading this! Sincerely, Angela Miller </p>
<p> I recently went from a 8 oz berry smoothie to a 32 oz berry smoothie per day and my body is reacting in very strange way. When I am finished eating my smoothie I start sneezing. Watery eyes and runny nose that last about 3-4 days. Crazy, I was doubtful that a berry smoothie, although very large, could cause these symptoms so I stopped and went back to my 8 oz smoothie and I no longer have this issue. Who would of thought, I never had any allergies to fruit before, but I guess in such large quantity, my body was telling me to knock it off. </p>
<p> It’s amazing how many people will tell you it’s ok to eat fruit as much as you want. The fiber slows the absorption, they say. Meanwhile I’m downing apples, oranges and bananas almost all day long and start wondering there really must be something not so healthy about it, and here we are. </p>
<p> Wait? I want to eat more fruit when I’m eating fruit. </p>
<p> Hold up? This is why I want to cut a slit in my stomach and let the air out like a balloon? </p>
<p> holy crap?? So this is why my man doesn’t want to sleep in the same bed same bed as me afternoon I’ve eaten a bucket of fruit?? (flatulence. ) </p>
<p> Wait UP!? a serving should ONLY be 1/2 a cup!? </p>
<p> ANSWERS TO EVERYTHING ON THIS ARTICLE YOU’VE MAPPED OUT FOR US! </p>
<p> Thank you so much, I don’t know why I didn’t google these specifics before. Knowing how’s BADLY I sometimes would feel. Yes I knew about how high the sugars could be, but after reading all this information, I was basically clueless. (As if!) </p>
<p> Came across this when I googled ‘can you eat too much fruit’ apart from smoothies I can identify with every point and the link to cereal for breakfast! Thanks for explaining it all so well </p>
<p> This definitely sounds like me. I’m always on one diet another trying to lose weight and get through a lot of fruit (as diets direct) – I suffer from frequent diarrhoea and wind with energy plummeting an hour or so after I eat. Am going to cut out fruit altogether for a bit to see how that goes. Thanks for explaining it so clearly 🙂 </p>
<p> I came across the article and thought I would comment. I’m a 49 year old male in pretty good health – I’m not currently on any meds, eat a pretty balanced die, have a normal BMI, and exercise most days. However, I have been noticing I have been getting diarrhea lately. I guess it’s likely due to the fact that since it’s summer I’ve been eating a Peach, Nectarine and Apple every day. I eat vegetables as well, but do love fruit – especially the summer ones. Guess should cut out one of the fruits eh? </p>
<p> I’ve adopted a very healthy lifestyle in the last 6 months. I work out everyday and weigh everything I eat. My caloric breakdown is 40% carbs, 30% fat, and 30% protein. I’ve lost 60 lb and my body fat is below 10%. I was doing great and felt great until the last few weeks. I bought a Vitamix 2 months ago and have gone overboard with the smoothies. My carbohydrate intake has steadily shifted away from vegetables, quinoa and brown rice. I finally realized what has been causing my fatigue. I’m going to cut back on the fruit. Thanks for the info. </p>
<p> Ok so after reading this I’m realizing I’m probs a fruit addict…. It’s I’ve half my diet and I certainly exceed in enormous ways the recommended amount . I’d always eat them because I found that they were the only things that could quench this undying “thirst” I have, however now I’m realizing that it’s possible that the more fruits I’ve had, the more dependent I’ve become. So, hopefully by laying low in the fruit and trying to eat more vegetables I’ll be less dehydrated… let’s see what happens .-. </p>
<p> Thanks Lily, you rock ! I have tried to go vegan, and it never worked for me. When I eat a big fruit meal, I get bloated very quickly and it lasts for a few hours. Not painful…but uncomfortable. I feel the need to eat some fruit meals just to clean myself out though. It’s tricky finding the right amount of everything. Blessings. </p>
<p> Thank you for this post. I always felt at my best when I have 2 servings of fruits a day. This post affirms that it is perfectly fine to just have 2 servings of fruits and not feel guilty that I am unable to have more. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. </p>
<p> Hi It is rather strange with me because I asked my personal trainer the day before Christmas how many kgs he thought I weighed. He said 60 kg and I fit in size small or 10 top and 12 lower body. I have not been 60 kg for a very long time. I weigh min 75 kg. My basic food was fruit. Until I read your advice here. I got the wrong message. I usually had fruit for breakfast and eat some lunch. I don’t eat much and I have a down to earth diet but not organic. I look 60 to 65 kg but I do feel heavy. I feel my weight. I’ve been trying to lose weight for very long time. My weight is stuck at 75. I did intermittent fasting from dinner 12 to 14 hours without food or water. My weight was getting close to 80 kg so I stopped that. I am so happy I found this article by asking google could I be eating too much fruit. It all makes sense. My New Year resolution is to lose 11 kg. You may be my saviour. I started this 1 Ian. 21 </p>
<p> My due date is Aug 18. I’ve been conscientious about carbs, trying to avoid GDM, since pre-pregnancy. I’m wondering how I’m gonna handle my last trimester in the throws of fruit season here in southern California. Pray for me </p>
<p> If you have Real Food for Gestational Diabetes, it explains how to balance your macronutrients to avoid blood sugar spikes. Fruit doesn’t necessarily need to be cut out, just needs to be consumed in portions that work for your unique carbohydrate tolerance. </p>
<p> Hi Lily, I’ve developed digestion problems and mild constipation after drinking a flavoured probiotic yoghurt drink and a tall glass of pure orange juice daily for over a year to try to get my cholesterol level down (it’s elevated due to pre-clinical hypothyroidism) but I’ve piled on 2 stones and don’t currently feel well at all. As a 95% vegetarian, I’ve always eaten lots of fruit and vegetables and loads of fibre from my diet but I’m realizing the yoghurts and juice are probably the culprit for my digestion problems and weight gain and have stopped both. Thank you for highlighting that I probably eat way too much fruit as well!! </p>
<p> Totally agree about the fruit. And that’s coming from a fruit-o-holic. After I’ve cut all the bad food choices I was still gaining weight. As soon as I cut the fruits my constant appetite/hunger disappeared. I may feel that my guts are empty, but have no desire to eat. I still have an appetite to eat 3 times per day and still have a need for meat or eggs in small amounts. It takes a few days to get set in this condition after the fruit is cut completely (or eating a bite or two with the meal only). There were other significant health benefits as well. </p>
<p> Wow! I’m glad I found you. I eat a huge bowl of fruit a day. I have a banana, orange during day and bowl of grapes, strawberries, kiwi. Today for example I had banana, blackberries with porridge. Tea time I had a big bowl, grapes, kiwi fruit, orange, 3 strawberries. I’ve been doing this for years. I’m 54, 15st, 6ft 2″ slender, I don’t put weight in my legs, arms other than a bloated stomach. I eat chicken, fish only drink water. Don’t exercise as I should but youthful looking. But only my belly looks bloated like a pregnant woman. When I read your take on fruit I think it is that. It’s causing this belly fat. Too much sugar from fruit and irritating my digestion system. Going to have to print this page. </p>
<p> Wow! Wondered why i wasn’t losing weight! I eat so much fruit, which i thought was a good thing! </p>
<p> I found your tips very interesting, it has made me think about the amount of fruit I eat as I have , banana, strawberries in my breakfast, then lunch I have strawberries, grapes (red and green) and sometimes kewi, but I also have a few when making my lunch up at night for the nxt day , so I think now I will be eating less fruit </p>
<p> You’re right about different amounts being right for different people. We eat a rotating assortment of fruit (which always includes avocado) in the morning. It seems like the amount of fruit that barely kickstarts hubby’s system gives me diarrhea an hour later. Could I control the diarrhea by keeping the amount of avocado the same (just enough to make avocado toast), cut the fruit mixture in half and add half a banana to it? Also, he thinks slightly underripe fruit is better to start his system moving – would that be part of my diarrhea problem too? </p>
<p> I was tolled a story by a teacher, he said he tried a fruit ONLY detox diet for 3 months, and because he felt so amazing he stayed on the diet, he kept it up for 2 years, and then got chronically sick, doctors did a blood test, doctors said he had a very high buildup toxin caused by eating to much fruit. tolled him not to eat fruit again for 12 months, as almost all fruit except cooked pears contain this toxin. (but can’t remember what the toxin was called) </p>
<p> I had a mini stroke 3 weeks ago but i am really fine . I was never a fruit or veg lover but because of my stroke i started eating lots and lots of fruit and veg only because i think it will make me healthier . However today i took a right scunner to the fruit i was going to eat and had to forego eating any same went for the nuts i.ve been eating as well . My stomach doesnt feel right and i am full of wind . In fact going to eat the fruit today made me actually feel sick . What if any is the solution </p>
<p> Hi Lily I came across your message seeking some help to understand why I react so strongly to fruit I can eat a banana and berries in the morning with my breakfast but a mid afternoon pear makes me uncomfortably hot. Like an all over hot flush. I can no longer tolerate any sugar what so ever but hoped fruit would still be my friend. Alas no. Any advice would be so welcome please. </p>
<p> You failed to mention that one of the reasons people feel bloated from fruit is also because of pesticides. My family eats a lot of fruit and in the past we didn’t get bloating like we do nowadays and apparently it is because many farmers use a ton of pesticides on fruit (cherries and grapes for example, get sprayed on many times, even in the flowering stage). Washing fruit before eating helps only marginally, as the pesticides are inside the fruit itself. When I had the opportunity eat fruit that had been treated with very little pesticide, there was no bloating. Though, you might encounter worms 😉 </p>

<p> Stranded Deep </p>
<p> I'm finding it very hard to stock up/find food. I know you can find potato plants and kill crabs (which makes you sick), but can someone tell me some other easy ways to find food? </p>
<p> Coconut is useful. Cut it to where it's drinkable, keep cutting it to halve it for food. </p>
<p> Coconut is useful. Cut it to where it's drinkable, keep cutting it to halve it for food. </p>
<p> Didn't know you could cut it for food; I always just used it as drink. Thanks </p>
<p> Cook the crabs, you dont need a spit to put them on. Just right click and move the crab over the fire, it will crackle. Then once its cooked it will make a ching sound! :) </p>
<p> Cook the crabs, you dont need a spit to put them on. Just right click and move the crab over the fire, it will crackle. Then once its cooked it will make a ching sound! :) </p>
<p> Eat the potatoes, cook the crabs then eat them, you can also drink from the coconuts then eat them (so eat/drink from just a single coco) and cook fish then eat them. So far those are the only things you can eat right now. </p>
<p> does anyone else think food/eating is under powered? you seem to need to eat allot for no great reward - to fill hunger = 8 crabs, 8 coconuts, 8 potatos. </p>
<p> Also the amount of fire wood needed to cook the crabs 1 crab = 1 wood, far too much (IMO) </p>
<p> Best food resource is tiger sharks, 4 row meat by shark, each restoring fully the hunger once cooked and it takes also one stick to cook them like those crabs who waste precious firework, or sardines and other small fishes that you can hunt, it takes one palm branch into the fire fire to cook one (or two if lucky and fast enough) but those restore very few the bar. </p>
<p> There is marlins to hunt but when you kill them they vanish in the sea so i don't know how much you can get from them, same thing with whith great white sharks, they vanish into the sea when killed, untill they fix this mess i can't say if those provide better food than sharks. </p>
<p> Firewood and cooking is badly done, one freaking stick to cook a single crab barely restoring anything, you will spend an antire tree on your fire just to resotre fully the bar cooking those... We should be able to put crabs into a small stick or make a kind of barbecue so we can cook 10 sardines or 5 crabs at once, or put 5 crabs into the bucket and make them cook, same thing with potatoes ( lmao at potatoes on a pacific islands btw ), we should be able to drop few potatoes on the fire or inside the bucket with the crabs and boil all this, this is one of the big flows of the game for me, right now i have to swim from one island to another just to cut a maximum of trees and have enough wood to cook things as i killed so many tiger sharks around my island that this nice source of food became very rare now, doing this i also loose my axes and constantly need rocks to make new ones as they deplete very fast. </p>
<p> We need to be able to cook multiple crabs and small fishes at once and also 2 shark row meat at once, when you look at the size of the wood sticks it's a shame to see those lasting so short, firewood and rocks will be the primary problem if sharks don't come back around my island so i can hunt them again and get a reasonable waste of firewood for them </p>
<p> ( Also why can't i just use a hammer on big stone all around to get rocks ... ) </p>
<p> From what I have been able to learn from watching Youtube and Twitch. In the current state of the game food is so plentiful it is hardly a chore to stay at full health because of the following 2 things. </p>
<p> 1. Potato plants are infinite and can be eaten raw. You can re-harvest them after only a few minutes even though they appear to be in a harvested state and hard to see. Saving, quitting and reloading the game makes the leaves grow back making them easier to see again. </p>
<p> 2. Sardines are infinite as long as you are willing to take the time to fish for them and they can be eaten raw with no ill effects. If you swim around and island looking for sardines, by the time you get back to where you started, new sardines have already re-spawned. </p>
<p> Also, Yucca plants are infinite as well as seem to be able to be re-harvested after only a few minutes. This makes lashings infinite and no problem getting more then you will ever need in the first 20 minutes of playing. </p>
<p> As far as water.. This mechanic is very un-realistic and I am sure it will change, but finding a bucket and cooking sea water will net you fresh water which can be drunk 2-3 times each time restoring near/full thirst. </p>
<p> Game looks good so far for being such and early ALPHA release. I plan on buying in the future when there is more to do. Looks like one would get bored of playing after only 6-8 hours of gameplay. </p>
<p> If it gets better at the same rate that Kerbal Space Program has over the years, should make a pretty awesome game in 12-24 months :P </p>
<p> Maybe a bit late, but slightly away from the coast you'll find a lot of different fish, including the Frontosa, which can be eaten uncooked and feeds more than the discus and sardine which can also be eaten uncooked. If you go even further away to deep sea, you can find the cod and giant bass, which have to be cooked but give a lot of food bars, somewhere around 6. (All these fish have to be caught with a spear.) </p>
<p> I'd like to add that sharks are very good for food too, especially the Black Tip Reef sharks are nice, because they won't attack you, the do however only give 2 pieces of shark meat instead of the 4 from tiger sharks. You can drag the shark bodies to the shore and right click them with a cutting tool to get your shark meat, don't forget to cook them; bon appetit. </p>
<p> Craft spear (2 sticks, lashing, rock shard i think). Dive in water. Find Fish. :) </p>
<p> I'm fairly sure this is right... You can eat the fish (cooked/raw) without getting sick: </p>
<p> RAW OR COOKED: </p>

<p> Fruit, Vegetable & Lean Meat Diet </p>
<p> ABOUT THE AUTHOR </p>
<p> Andrea Boldt has been in the fitness industry for more than 20 years. A personal trainer, run coach, group fitness instructor and master yoga teacher, she also holds certifications in holistic and fitness nutrition. </p>
<p> A diet consisting of lean protein, fresh fruits and vegetables mimics the diets of our ancient ancestors and, proponents believe, best suits our genetics and digestion. Such a diet, embodied in the Paleo Diet Plan, can be very healthy, but challenging to stick to because it is so restrictive. The high protein content keeps you sated and you acquire tons of fiber and nutrients through fresh raw produce. The diet puts no limits on the amounts of fruit, vegetables and lean meat you may eat--but it does forbid the intake of any food that does not fall into those categories. </p>
<p> Step 1 </p>
<p> Unlimited seafood and lean meat. </p>
<p> Eat unlimited amounts of lean cuts of meat. Focus on seafood, skinless white meat poultry, pork tenderloin, flank steak, bison and wild game. Trim away all visible fat. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Step 2 </p>
<p> Eat liberal amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p> Eat liberal amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables. Do not limit your intake of these items. Eat much of your produce raw to maximize nutritional value and fiber. Go for high-volume, low-calorie vegetables like lettuce, broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Make natural, plant-based oils the basis of all fats in your diet. </p>
<p> Substitute healthy oils for butter, margarine and shortening. Use olive oil, flaxseed, nut oils and avocado oil to help decrease your intake of saturated fat. Make these natural, plant-based oils the basis of all fats in your diet. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Step 4 </p>
<p> Avoid foods that would not have been available to people in hunting and gathering times--this includes peanut butter, pasta or any other products containing flour. Forgo all grains, legumes (beans, peas and soy), dairy, refined sugar, starchy vegetables and coffee because these were not available to humans prior to the introduction of agriculture. </p>
<p> Step 5 </p>
<p> Do not eat baked goods, pickled foods or vinegar </p>
<p> Stay away from yeast and salt. Do not eat baked goods, pickled foods, vinegar or food products that have gone through fermentation because these foods are not as quality of a source of fiber and B Vitamins as are fruits and vegetables. Season food with powdered garlic or onion, citrus juices, pepper, cayenne and chili powder or other natural spices which enhance health and do not cause bloating as does salt. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> The first month of the diet can be challenging as your body becomes accustomed to a new way of eating. You might find your energy dips as you adjust to making fruits and vegetables your primary source of carbohydrates. </p>
<p> Warning </p>
<p> No scientific data supports the long-term adherence to this diet. In general, the recommendations are healthy, but you might become deficient in specific nutrients because of the lack of whole grains and dairy. </p>

<p> The Bible's stance on eating meat may surprise you </p>

<p> Spring is a time to explore Ventura County's food offerings </p>
<p> Go to a vegetarian dinner in Ojai. Stock up on tomato seedlings in Fillmore. Visit the Easter bunny (and pick your own produce) in Moorpark. Take your pick between beer and tequila tastings in Ventura. Yep, there's plenty to do, see and taste this weekend in Ventura County. </p>
<p> STAR STAFF </p>
<p> Q: I have an ongoing problem because I'm living as a hypocrite. I'm an animal lover but I eat meat. I don't eat veal or lamb because they are from young animals, but I eat meat, fish, fowl and eggs. Is there anything in the Bible that refers to this or to Christ's personal practice? Did Jesus eat meat? I'm aware that I'm looking for absolution for eating meat, but I can't get rid of this conflict in my mind. As I say, it is hypocritical. I would never hunt or fish, but I eat what someone else kills to put meat on my table. Is killing and eating animals a sin in the eyes of God or Jesus? What would Jesus have said? -- From L </p>
<p> P.S. I contribute to many animal groups, especially to help farm animals and to ban dog racing, etc., but it doesn't erase the guilt. </p>
<p> A: In Genesis 1:29 God speaks to Adam, </p>
<p> "And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb-bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food." </p>
<p> In the second chapter of Genesis (2:16-17) vegetarianism is re-affirmed as people's spiritually proper diet. However, one tree in the Garden of Eden bore forbidden fruit, </p>
<p> "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." </p>
<p> Nothing could be clearer. God does not want us to eat meat. People are made in God's image and animals are not, but this spiritual difference is not sufficiently morally significant to allow killing animals for food. Killing another person is a capital crime and a sin. Killing an animal is just a sin. </p>
<p> The moral and spiritual ambiguity about eating meat is made more explicit in the ninth chapter of Genesis (Genesis 9:3-6) when God tells Noah in the covenant made with him after the Great Flood, </p>
<p> "Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man." </p>
<p> So God has a change of heart and strikes what I consider to be a perfect spiritual balance. God is saying that being a vegetarian is clearly the higher way, but it is not the only way. Meat is not murder, but it is not the highest moral level to which we can elevate our diet. Eating meat also makes us comfortable around blood, and blood is life. Spilling the blood of animals makes us less revolted by spilling the blood of people. </p>
<p> This nuanced position that eating meat is a concession to human carnivorous urges but not our highest level helps us to learn that the Bible offers us many levels of spiritual practice. We can live a life on as high a level as we want. </p>
<p> The question of whether or not Jesus was a vegetarian is complicated. There is no direct statement on the subject by Jesus in the New Testament. The story of Jesus feeding fish to people would support the view that Jesus may have been a pescatarian. Paul seems to have been more open to meat eating, but even Paul was open to vegetarianism. In 1 Corinthians 8:13 Paul said, "Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend." So for Paul vegetarianism was a way of not offending vegetarian hosts, but was not an explicit command of God. </p>
<p> Modern Christianity has produced the vegetarian Seventh Day Adventists who are vegetarians because of the teachings of their co-founder Ellen G. White. </p>
<p> So what can I say to ease your carnivorous guilt? I would suggest that you experiment with meatless Mondays, and then no meat till dinner, and then maybe a period of time when you eat no meat for a period of time. Your moral intuitions are right. There is something hypocritical about the way we profess life and then eat the world to death. Remember that your journey to God has many levels and you ought to have no shame or guilt about the stage of your journey that you have reached so far. </p>

<p> 8 Animals Eaten Alive in China – Graphic Content </p>
<p> Some religious people are forbidden to eat any portion that is cut from animals that are still alive. </p>
<p> On the contrary, the practice of eating alive animals is widespread around Asia. Monkey brain, fishes, baby mice, donkeys, snakes. In Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and even in China is considered delicious and synonymous with freshness. </p>
<p> Animals eaten alive: </p>
<p> Oysters </p>
<p> Oysters are the most common animal often eaten raw and alive even in the West. </p>
<p> In fact they are considered healthiest when eaten raw on the half shell. </p>
<p> Drunken Shrimps </p>
<p> A popular traditional Chinese dish is Zui Xia, Drunken Shrimps. It is also possible to find it in some Chinese Restaurants in the United States. Freshwater shrimps are dipped in an alcoholic drink, usually baijiu. </p>
<p> At the beginning the shrimps try to jump around to escape and the consumers have to catch them. </p>
<p> Once intoxicated, the shrimps are easier to eat. They only dies, finally, when being chewed. </p>
<p> Modified recipes are used in different parts of China. This dish is quite expensive because to serve the shrimps alive, it must be prepared quickly and the chef must be skillful. </p>
<p> The dish is banned in China, but it’s still possible to find it. </p>
<p> Dead and Alive Fish </p>
<p> Another popular alive food in China is Ying Yang Yu, Dead and Alive Fish because the fish’s body is rapidly deep-fried and served while the head, not fried, is still fresh and moving. </p>
<p> It is prepared extremely quickly, with care not to damage the internal organs, so the fish can remain alive for 30 minutes. </p>
<p> It is served with sweet and sour sauce on the body. </p>
<p> One of the reasons that make this dish popular is because the restaurant boast about how fresh the fish is. </p>
<p> Snakes </p>
<p> Alive snake are a specialties of Chinese chefs. </p>
<p> Also, this dish is prepared very quickly so that the customers can eat snake meat when it still alive and moving. </p>
<p> The chef, faster as he can, cut the head, remove the skin, removed the bowels, in such a way as to eliminate the parasites, cut the meat, and serve the raw snake. </p>
<p> Raw alive snake meat, sometimes was reported by the media, eaten by peasant without chef help. </p>
<p> Live Fresh Donkey </p>
<p> Not so popular in all China is to eat Huo Jiao Lu (活叫驴), Live Fresh Donkey. </p>
<p> The animal has its legs tied and its body held down, while the chef cuts its body and serves the meat immediately to customers. </p>
<p> Some media reported that alive raw donkey meat could be sold from peddlers in Henan and Hubei even if the Chinese government banned it. </p>
<p> Raw alive monkey brain </p>
<p> Raw alive monkey brain is a special dish affordable only by very rich people and is possible to order it only in Guangdong and, once, in Hong Kong. </p>
<p> The chef puts a live monkey beneath a table with its head poking up through a hole, the costumers then eat its brains while it screams. </p>
<p> This dish is very expensive. </p>
<p> Sometimes costumers that order this dish want to prove their richness and bravery, but many can’ t swallow a single bite. </p>
<p> The dish was banned in China. </p>
<p> A scene from the 1978 movie Faces of Death by John Alan Schwartz </p>
<p> A representation of how the monkey brain is eaten </p>
<p> Baby Mice 三吱儿 </p>
<p> Newborn mice (San Zhi Er) are eaten alive with chopsticks and served in a spicy sauce. </p>
<p> They are called “three squeaks babies” because they would scream three times: the first time when they are grabbed with the chopsticks, the second time when they are dipped in the sauce, and the third final squeak inside the mouth of the customer. </p>
<p> Alive baby duck embryos </p>
<p> Alive duck embryos (活珠子) are a famous Nanjing speciality. </p>
<p> Duck embryos are eaten when the egg is about to hatch into a life but it does not fully formed. </p>
<p> Sometimes, in other areas, the egg is boiled before being consumed. 活珠子 is a variation of Balut, Duck Embryo, a dish originally from the Philippines. </p>
<p> The main difference with the original recipe is that instead of eating the eggs boiled, in China they eat them raw. </p>
<p> Raw alive embryo </p>
<p> Cooked embryo </p>
<p> Others </p>
<p> Every year Chinese media reported about cases of Chinese peasants that eaten raw alive meat. Two of the most particular are the cases of Wen Xide and Jiang Musheng. </p>
<p> Wen Xide is a peasant from of Wangzhuang village, Zhumadian. The 41 years old man said, in 2009, he ate alive snakes with a cold beer. </p>
<p> In 2007 Jiang Musheng, from a village in Shangrao, Jiangxi province claimed that eating live frogs cured his intestinal problems. He also eats live mice and baby rats. </p>
<p> The 66 year old man admitted once he ate 20 mice in a single day. </p>

<p> Somehow eating live animals is worse than nuking millions of people. Mental Gymastics. But congratulations still, you’ve fallen victim to a targeted campaign for dehumanising an entire culture. </p>
<p> well,I think what defines humans are their behavior .I don’t see a humane behavior here.This barbaric not cultural. </p>
<p> Even worse than this IMO is the killing and eating of dogs. Many of these creatures have more decency and warmth in their hearts than the calloused, ignorant human beings devouring their flesh. Dogs are not called man’s best friend for nothing! This cruel practice should be outlawed! Come Lord Jesus come. </p>
<p> I am not bigoted by any means, but it seems the Chinese take much pleasure in causing extreme suffering for animals. There is no purpose, no benefit, to consume a live animal. It only causes needless suffering to the creature. Just ponder if the roles were reversed and it was the human diner being eaten bit by bit alive. </p>
<p> I guess the benefit of consuming a live animal is that it takes less time to prepare and is also more fresh. Maybe they don’t really enjoy the pain it causes to the animal but simply do it because it’s more convenient. We have to take quite some time to prepare a dish, but they just eat everything raw because they don’t care about animals so I guess it makes sense to them in a weird way. </p>
<p> There is no need. Dismembering a live donkey is asinine. In most cultures it is slaughtered on demand. Why would you keep it alive? You have to stitch up wounds deal with infections, now it can’t walk. Totally pointless. Live monkey brain is just a show of machismo, like many of these hedonistic rituals, it’s Hannibal Lecter status. Most of these creatures have parasites, they need to be cooked. This is soulless cruelty. I’m glad that even their soulless government even sees the barbarity of this. Eat what you want (except people!), just humanely slaughter it. </p>
<p> Sick, sick, evil people. They apparently have no humanity or empathy for life at all. </p>
<p> Way to generalize an entire population by what a few bad eggs do. Did you even read the article? It says these practices are banned in China. Which means they are done illegally. </p>
<p> They say we dehumanise a culture by telling them they’re cruel and disgusting.. but they’ve dehumanised themselves. They’re a waste of oxygen. Thankfully there are a large number of buddhists in china that know that it is wrong </p>
<p> Pleeeease stop them! What the hell are they doing? I can’t believe that no one has stoped them yet! Omg I’m crying </p>
<p> Hurry up, space aliens, so we can show you where the Mini-Chinese Biped Eggrolls are. </p>
<p> There is tears in my eyes just reading this..Aren’t all living creatures created equally on Earth then how can these human beings can be so inhumane? Are they not human beings ?? Where is humanity here ?? What is this culture that promotes unbearable unspeakable pain, suffering to the fellow living beings ?? This is barbaric and demonic !! </p>
<p> We expect humans to treat other humans well after doing this to other living creatures? Compassion starts with respecting ALL life. Only then will humans evolve. </p>
<p> Everywhere in the world, it is acceptable to be cruel to animals for the sake of eating. We need to become a vegetarian world. The world will be a better place then. </p>
<p> I’ll bet none of the people making racist comments on this page have ever been to China it shows in their ignorance </p>
<p> I am Chinese and I am totally horrified by these monstrousity. Eating an egg raw will simply make me throw out. </p>
<p> Yes there are many kind compassionate Chinese who are trying to stop the dog and cat meat trade I know your whole race is not like this There are some though who are very cruel and barbaric and enjoy seeing animals suffer as they torture them But of course we don’t believe the whole country is like that Maybe one day all your country will be kind and caring towards other living beings and stop all this cruelty Not only in China but all over Asia </p>
<p> F*ck us for doing nothing. F*ck us for just leaving comments to be read by others. There have been precedence in history that will make us think that we are all capable of doing nothing, something & everything. The people who were capable of sending millions to the gas chamber and other methods of killing are far worse than words could describe them. Eating animals live and killing millions of people live should be in our minds always. The acts are entirely different and the same. Figure them out. </p>
<p> Yes animal suffering sucks… yes it’s more humane to kill the animal first. Yes I am grossed out by many of these dishes… but the racist comments are disgusting too. China has a huge population to feed and are eating what needs to be eaten to sustain it. I strongly disagree with any animal differing for food consumption purposes period. </p>
<p> But for the Americans running their mouths, your government spent a trillion dollars in Iraq resulting in a million dead humans on a pack of lies. It’s rich you can get all cranky over this website but not shed a tear for the million dead Vietnamese or any other country you’ve destroyed. How China eats isn’t a ‘worldly problem’. US setting fire to the world for the benefit of the elite is Get a grip guys. </p>
<p> The US went to war with Iraq because of a dictator they thought had weapons of mass destruction. A dictator who gased his own people. The US only fault has been to guard the world of such evil. China steals the US technology labels it as their own and sells it. Slaughter precious endangered exotic animals for the good of their own belly. You have played with fire and the worlds people have are dying from your careless heartless Lust for cruelty of those who give you nourishment with their bodies that weren’t meant for you. Killing any animal for food should be done in the most humane way and honor it for its giving you life better yet eat vegetables much healthier and no transfer of animal to man disease. This is a alarm to the world thousand of animals kept together for mass slaughter in horrible conditions People living on top of each other is a disaster waiting to happen again. Know where your food comes from. Why do they need masks to go into chicken houses because the conditions . The gestation crates pig live in and nurse. It’s disgusting ! </p>
<p> What kind of subhumans engage in these atrocities? My God – they’ve lost their souls over their appetites. </p>
<p> There is a ‘ virus’ going around the world at the moment , somebody knows the truth , it will be revealed , watch what you eat !!!! AND WHERE !!!! </p>
<p> Bruh, to everyone b******g about this two things: I agree with you that this s**t is disgusting and inhumane. I also thing you are really just retarded. China has a population of 1.4 billion+ if you think there are monkey brain and babymice farms everywhere in the country to support this you are also retarded. Most Chinese people eat chicken pork and beef like the rest of the world. The live food and stuff is more seen as a luxury/delicacy not really a common dish. China has an amazing and incredibly diverse culture with a huge population. The three squeaks mouse thing is from Canton or Guandong in South China. Get your ignorant head out of your a** and realize that China’s government doesn’t support this and nor do the majority of the people. Northerners look down on southerners because of this. ; </p>
<p> I agree with you totally I know there are many many many Chinese who are kind and compassionate and who have animals and would never hurt any living being It’s just these few cruel and barbaric practices people do in certain parts of China that leave us also horrified But yes we cannot base a whole nation on a few horrible people who should be eradicated from this earth </p>
<p> Let’s not forget about the viruses that get started from eating and preparing food this way. Need to quarantine the whole country permanently until they change their ways. Too many lives have been lost on their screwed up practices and lack of regulations. Absolutely barbaric and disgusting! </p>
<p> No wonder you guys have the fu*cking coronavirus , when you eat weird disgusting things and eat animals even disgusting ones alive …food is cooked to kill bacteria and enjoy the nutrients better </p>
<p> Some of them are banned by the gov’t in china. It also says you can still find it there and get it there. And other countries are mentioned as well. I can’t comprehend why they do this. I’m a vegan and disgusted beyond words. </p>
<p> Animal cruelty is awful, but it doesn’t get any better with this stereotyping of the entire Chinese population. </p>
<p> Such kind of cruelty to animals….o my goodness.These people are totally insane and mentally disturbed. They also need the same treatment from the animals when they would eat these people alive part by part. May the worst of curses befall on these heartless people </p>
<p> In my opinion, it is this practice of eating live uncooked animals that helped the Coronavirus to mutate and become more deadly… I hope we can advice all people esp the Chinese.people who are fond of eating live animals to slowly change this practice to slaughter and keep meet of animals.safe feom organisms.which eisily propagate within 8hrs standing on warm weather… it is a wake up call to everyone that cooking food well can kill viruses… may the Lord our God bless us all. </p>
<p> speechless wtf is wrong with them! If a law needs to be passed down to ban all meat please do it this is so sadddd and traumatizing in every way!!! As a human how?!?!?! How can you even enjoy eating something In this way how???????????? I’m going to cry myself to sleep for these animal so saddd beyond whyyyyyyyyyyy????????? </p>
<p> I’m chinese n I find this sick but it’s also very misleading. Its easy to assume ppl in China on the other side of the planet will eat anything and some of them do but trust me it’s very few. The country is so big so obviously you’re gonna find a grp of people in one city or province that eat one animal, doesn’t mean all 1.5 billion ppl do. Have u guys been to China? I have and ate in restaurants in like 10 cities n didnt see any weird or live animals going on. You would probably need to go hunting for a needle in a haystack backstreet restaurant that would even think of serving these. It even says that they are banned. If u ask 100 ppl in china they will all be grossed out by eating these. The only ones that might even consider eating these are poor old folks on the f*****g farm who grew up in times of poverty and stupid ppl willing to eat weird s**t to post on social media for attention </p>
<p> Dear Chinese people, its a globalized and well connected world, please eat responsibly. We reap what we sow! *Message is intended only for people who eat live animals and I mean any animal, this is cruel and disgusting. </p>
<p> I cannot believe my eyes. My heart hurts too. Bless all the souls of those animals. I am deeply shocked. </p>
<p> I’m shocked about the backwardness of these people. I thought China was a developed country? At least that’s what dictator Xi and his cohorts want to make us believe! </p>
<p> Some of theses people are also responsible for the threatening extinction of the rhinozeros. Are they impotent? Why else would they indulge in such perverted rituals?! And again, the same people are now responsible for bringing us the horrible new coronavirus pandemic with death and economic disaster. </p>
<p> Why doesn’t the government or health departments anywhere speak out about this primitive act of eating?! Anyone that doesn’t believe that this will be the last pandemic is loopy. As long as we deal with these countries that accept this behavior, it will trickled down to every other country from tourists everywhere. THIS IS INSANE and I don’t understand why no one talks about it on TV, Pres Trump or anyone. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT NOW. COME ON CHINA AND ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT EAT THESE ITEMS! IF WE DON’T ALL START SPEAKING UP AND QUIT BEING AFRAID OF OFFENDING OTHERS, THIS PANDEMIC AND MANY MORE WILL BE ONGOING! SUIT UP WORLD! </p>
<p> I think China is bad. ban cruelty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that’s why we are suffering because of COVUD29 </p>
<p> Where is animal’s rights from all of this ? should not there be an organisation to protect animals all over the world ?? or organisations are there just to steal money and ask people to pay so they can save endangered animals who in reality are not and were endangered because of HUMANS . Damn it this world is corrupted beyond any remedy ..we all need to shut down and restart cuz all humans failed to act like humans .. and china themselves pretend they are protecting pandas and make people come along to see them ! well I think they eat them secretly ..F** those sick barbarians . </p>
<p> I froze when I read all of this and what shocked me soooo much was the poor monkey ? is there any thing more sick than that ?? but I don’t wanna believe it …I hope its just a mistake that there might be a mistake in reporting this ? plz anyone tell me this was all fabricated because I can’t just accept it 🙁 </p>
<p> I always fight for animals and I want to work against people who cage small poor birds ..but this all when I read it I just realize how helpless Iam in helping animals ..I just pray to god that he can revenge those poor souls because god alone can help them ..damn those ill people all . </p>
<p> The Chinese are sick and so cruel, it’s their so called, disgusting Wet Markets that was the cause of this virus. Eating monkeys brains whilst the poor creature is alive and screaming is beyond belief. </p>

<p> Verse 4. - We know that an idol is nothing in the world.

<p> (1) that they were "demons" - the spirits of deified dead men; or </p>
<p> (3) that they were merely (lead images corresponding to nothing at all (Isaiah 44 etc.). That there is none other God but one. This belief is the signature of Judaism, according to their daily and oft repeated shema (Deuteronomy 6:4, etc.). </p>

<p> Should Humans Eat Meat? </p>
<p> Many people in the word now are becoming vegetarians. This debate will deal with the question: Is this a good idea? </p>
<p> Animals are below humans, therefore humans can eat them </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> Animals are inferior to humans. Animals, unlike humans, do not have morals- an animal who kills another animal cannot be punished. Animals can not create, unlike humans. The only “creating” that animals do is by instinct only, as a means of getting food. Animals don’t have rational thought. For all these reasons, humans have the right to eat animals. And in any case, most of the animals regularly eaten don’t have any kind of ability to be creative or make tools. </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> Humans have uniquely evolved to be able to consider the moral worth of their actions, however from a utilitarian perspective, the fact that animals do not have the ability to rationally consider the moral worth of their actions, has no ethical impact as it does not affect their ability to suffer. As eating meat causes suffering to animals, it is therefore wrong. </p>
<p> From a rights based perspective many humans who have developmental disorders also lack the the ability to be a moral agent, be creative or have rational thought, yet i doubt anybody would advocate eating them or denying them rights. The lack of these abilities are therefore irrelevant for judging if animals should be eaten or have rights. </p>
<p> Additionally many animals use tools to help them get food such as sticks or stones to get at otherewise unreachable food sources. Is this not the same kind of thinking that we consider creative? The ability of many animals to solve problems and even display meta-cognition (ie the ability to be aware of whether they know something or not) is well documented (see Couchman et al. 2011). As the exact cognitive abilities of animals is still unknown would it no be prudent to give them the benefit of the doubt especially when one can be perfectly healthy not eating meat? </p>
<p> Humans need meat in their diet </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> Meat is an essential part of the human diet. Although there are subsitutes for iron and protein gained from eating meat, these are not as good as the real thing; many vegetarians, while taking iron supplements and vitamins to “fill in” for the lack of meat, are anemic- their body isn’t as storng as the bodies of those who eat meat. Pregnant vegetarians are advised by their doctors to eat meat, so that the phetis is born healthy. Besides, not everyone can afford to buy these supplements, which can be very expensive. Therefore, humans must eat meat to stay healthy, and should not ignore this important part of their diet. </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> It is the position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada that appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases and are appropriate for all stages of the life-cycle including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence.[[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12826028]] Eating meat does not in itself make you healthy. Those who eat five ounces of meat daily increase their risk from cancer or heart disease by 30 percent compared to those who eat two-thirds of an ounce daily. Those who eat none at all are least likely to die from heart disease and cancer.[[Jim Montavalli, Meat the slavery of our time, Foreign Policy, 3rd June 2009]] </p>
<p> Additional while some vegetarians do consume supplements, the cost of these are minimal compared to the cost of meat. </p>
<p> If humans are like animals they should be able to eat them </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> Although the argument was made above that humans are superior to animals, there are some who might say that this is not true. However, even if you agree with this position and say we are at the same level as animals, we still have the right to eat them; if animals are allowed to eat animals, and we are like animals, then we should be allowed to eat animals as well. </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> Having the right to eat animals does not mean we have to eat animals. While there are obviously many carnivores there are also many herbivores that do not eat other animals. The level we are on does not make any difference to whether we should eat meat or not. Even if we are superior to animals does that mean we should automatically consider them food, animals perform other tasks for us; companionship, beasts of burden, used in war, as symbols etc </p>
<p> Eating meat is indeed natural in the sense that other animals do it as well. In fact, it is even done on occasion by our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. However, there are many other things which are also natural. For example, chimpanzee males sometimes rape the females in their tribe. Chimpanzees sometimes engage in organized warfare against other tribes with which they compete for territory. A chimpanzee male, in a moment of rage, sometimes picks up a nearby infant, and crushes his skull against a rock. </p>
<p> If we believed that eating meat was ethically permissible simply because other animals did it as well, then this would imply that there is nothing wrong with rape, cannibalism, or infanticide, all of which routinely occurs throughout the animal kingdom. </p>
<p> All the opposition’s arguments are environmental </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> If the only arguments that the opposition can come up with are environmental, than we should stop using any form of electronic devices that aren’t completely neccessary (like iPods, computers, TVs etc.) Also, most of the meat eaten is taken from livestock – animals that have been domesticated so much that they are incapable of sustaining themselves, and not eating meat would mean that they would be left out in the wild and be easy meat for predators – which would have a huge impact on the ecosystem, which is in a precarious state anyway. </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> Is the environment a bad reason? eating less meat (not necessarily none) is a very easy way to help the environment. Many would find it easier to do than getting rid of their cars. And gas lamps are not a sensible substitute as they would be much more environmentally damaging than electricity (which can be produced cleanly). The only reason the livestock would be easy prey is because we bastardized these animals to the fact that they don’t even know what to eat. Cows shouldn’t eat corn, they should graze on grass. Furthermore, if there wasn’t years of eating meat than these animals wouldn’t be on the planet to begin with. Your argument is like saying we should continue to use heroin because we bought a pound and it would poison our water supply to flush it. AND the raising of livestock accounts for 37 percent of all human-induced methane (23 times as warming as CO2), which is largely produced by the digestive system of ruminants, and 64 percent of ammonia, which contributes significantly to acid rain (according to http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html). </p>
<p> There’s nothing inherently wrong with eating animals </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> Well, first of all, I’d like to separate myself from the normal meat eater. I am an animist. This means I believe animals have souls and spirits, and are moral creatures. This can be proven through scientific observation as well as proven by the Bible, for those who give authority to the Bible that is. </p>
<p> Animals are moral just as every much as humans are. Animals are very intelligent, much more than we give them credit for. Certain animals are carnivores by nature. They are currently designed to eat only meat. This is important to keep in mind when we realize that these carnivores are moral creatures with a high enough intelligence to recognize that they are eating other animals. So, the question then becomes, is meat eating inherently immoral? I argue no, because if it was, then I would have to say carnivores are sinning by eating the only thing they can eat naturally. The truth is, animals, which are moral creatures, can morally eat other animals. Therefore, if they can, then there is definitely a possibility we can morally do so. At any rate, even humans should not, carnivores morally can, and thus eating meat is not inherently immoral. </p>
<p> Now, the main argument for vegetarianism is that it causes unnecessary pain and suffering and unnecessary death. The vegetarian seems to be opposed to death for any and all reasons, but why? Do they even know why they don’t like death? The truth is, life is a precious gift, and to trash it, or treat it disrespectfully, is a serious moral offense. But, are there not times when killing is justified? Let us say for example, in war, for defending others, or self-defense when you defend yourself and one’s family. And the death penalty being given to people. Things like that. Death is a natural part of life. But death is not to be brought on by any immoral means. But, death will naturally come, and we should respect this course of life. We should be greatly that the animal becomes part of us. Their spirit and soul do not go inside us, but they died so that we could live. And this is honorable. We should respect animals. Animals should be treated rightfully, and if they are killed, we must make sure they do not go to waste, for to kill an animal for no good reason, and then not use the animal, is a serious moral offense. I argue that killing is sometimes justifiable, and in the case of killing animals for food, it is not murder, but justifiable killing, so long as you are not cruel in your killing. </p>
<p> I also believe that just as animals do, we have a prime duty to our own kinds. What I mean by this is I believe humans priority should be humans. Cats priority should be cats. Dogs priority should be dogs. etc. I am against all forms of cannibalism. I believe animals that are cannibals are sinning. And I believe that certain animals have a moral right to eat humans. So, let’s say if a bear comes and kills a human for food. We should not kill the bear. however, if the bear kills the human for no reason, as I said before, killing something for no good reason is a serious moral offense. The bear would be sinning. But, the bear has every right to eat the human just as much as we have every right to eat some animals. We also have the right and moral right to defend ourselves and our families. So, if an animal is trying to eat one of my fellow humans, I will seek to defend that human. likewise, if one of us is trying to eat an animal, they have a right to defend themselves. </p>
<p> One last bit of clarification that sets me apart from other meat eaters. I am a Nazarene Jew. Part of being a Nazarene Jew means I believe that some animals are off limits. We are not to eat anything that is unhealthy for us. Thus, we are not to eat any unclean (or in other words, unkosher) animals. This includes shrimp, clams, lobsters, swine, and other animals that are extremely unhealthy. basically all scavengers and meat eaters are off limits for humans. Are unique body structure cannot have these unclean animals healthily in our bodies. I believe eating meat is necessary for perfect health in our current state of environment. However, once the Messiah returns, the environment will change as the prophecies indicate, and we will no longer need to eat animals, and it will be a sin to eat animals. Animals will also not be allowed to eat animals. This is found in the Book of Isaiah chapters 65 and 66. This is a restoration to how it was in the beginning, before the flood. I look forward to when that day comes. </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> While i disagree that animals are capable of being moral, If they are, then is it not also true that animals would also be capable of immoral acts? Take for instance infanticide in wild chimpanzees, does the fact that chimps can kill and eat their offspring imply that humans are morally justified in doing the same? The way that animals behave is “designed” by evolution, but their is no designer in this process, and no ethics behind the behaviours of animals as they do not consider the moral value of their actions. Therefore to appeal to nature to defend an ethical principle is flawed. </p>
<p> While killing may be justifiable in some circumstances at the extremes of survival, the eating of meat is not required for any aspect of our health, and eating a meat free diet may reduce the occurrence of many diseases including cancer, heart disease and diabetes. As most people will never encounter those conditions under which killing of any animal is necessary for survival, the eating of meat by those people is wrong. </p>
<p> We shouldn’t eat as muh meat. </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> Meat is not inherently wrong. It is something we as human’s are designed to eat, we are Apex predators , top of the food chain, we are built to hunt and consume other animals. </p>
<p> The arguments that meat is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly do not mean that we should not eat meat, it simply means that we should not eat as much. We as a species have developed some obsense methdos of slughter and production to feed our gluttony, it is not moral to keep a pig in a cage simply because we want to consume its flesh, however this does not mean we should not eat meat. </p>
<p> We should not activly practose cruelty to animals, we should treat them as living things that do require protection, but we should also treat them as a food source, not a food source to be exploited and mass farmed like we currently use them but a food source to be hunted to satisfy hunger and nutritianal needs. </p>
<p> Lets look back to early civilization where most of a person;s diet would consist of grains and vegetables. A small villiage would practise farming of grains to make breads and vegetables, this was most of their diet. They would use cattle to pull plows and occasionally tehy would kill the cattle and eat it. This was how life was. </p>
<p> I do not believe that this was an immoral way of living, it is not about wether we shoudl eat meat it is about how we currently eat meat. We need to have an awarness of environmental harm and look at reducing it, we need to aknowledge animal cruelty and stop it, we need to farm and prodice efficiently but we do not need to stop eating meat. </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> Humans evolved to be able to eat meat, but that has no impact on the question of the ethics of meat eating because the evolution of our species was entirely lead by chance and the selection pressure of our environment. Their is no ethics in nature. However we have also evolved to be able to be able to make ethical judgements and change our behaviour in accordance to our values. If one one wishes to stop animal cruelty the best way to change ones behaviour in accordance with that value is to stop eating meat. </p>
<p> Nutrition & Well-Being </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> Why eat meat? </p>
<p> Nutrition & Well-Being </p>
<p> Meat is not only one of the very oldest foods for humans, but is also one the most biologically valuable. This fact is mainly due to its high protein content. In addition, however, a part of the human requirement for vitamins and iron is also covered by eating meat. It is therefore not surprising that meat has an especially high importance in the menu planning of those people who have to deliver extreme performances. </p>
<p> The composition </p>
<p> In general, raw, unprocessed meat from the muscle is made up of the following: </p>
<p> Fat 3 – 15 % </p>
<p> Minerals, carbohydrates 1 – 5 % </p>
<p> Water 65 – 75 % </p>
<p> Meat protein supplies the body with the necessary amino acids in almost the ratio that it needs. It is therefore of particularly high value. </p>
<p> Fat </p>
<p> The fat that is present in meat not only represents a high-quality source of energy, but is also an important quality factor. The juiciness and the aroma of meat and meat products is largely determined by the fat content. In addition, the fat from the meat from the muscle contains fatty acids that are indispensable for humans, and therefore has a very high nutritional physiological value. </p>
<p> Trace elements </p>
<p> Meat exhibits a wide spectrum of various trace elements in a balanced composition. A special importance is hereby placed on iron, which is present in meat in a form that can be utilised particularly well by humans. A significant proportion of the iron requirement of humans is covered by meat. Meat also plays an important role in the supply of zinc. </p>
<p> Vitamins </p>
<p> The water-soluble vitamins of the B-complex from meat and certain entrails make an important contribution to a human being’s vitamin supply. Humans are particularly dependent on foodstuffs from animal sources for the supply of Vitamin B12. With 100 g of muscle meat, the need for individual B-vitamins can be covered to between 20 % and 100 %. The liver takes a special position with regard to vitamin content, which, in addition to the B-vitamins, also has a high Vitamin A content. </p>
<p> Source: Proviande </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> It is the position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada that appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases and are appropriate for all stages of the life-cycle including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence.[[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12826028]] </p>
<p> Furthermore those who require “extreme performance” can find a comparable grade of protein quality from soya based products including soya “milk” shakes. All essential vitamins and nutrients can be acquired from vegan sources. </p>
<p> Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the American Dietetic Association have endorsed vegetarian diets. Studies have shown that vegetarians have stronger immune systems than meat-eaters and that meat-eaters are almost twice as likely to die of heart disease, 60 percent more likely to die of cancer, and 30 percent more likely to die of other diseases. Consumption of meat and dairy products has been conclusively linked with diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, clogged arteries, obesity, asthma, and impotence. </p>
<p> According to Dr T. Colin Campbell, nutritional researcher at Cornell University and director of the largest epidemiological study in history, “The vast majority of all cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and other forms of degenerative illness can be prevented simply by adopting a plant-based diet.” (i.e. a pure vegetarian diet with no animal by-products). </p>
<p> Plus just think about this for a moment: some of the world’s largest and strongest animals are pure vegetarians e.g. The Elephant, Hippo, Giraffe, Rhino, Cattle, Horses, Gorilla etc. And they seem to be thriving very well living off vegetation and have done so for many hundreds of years. . . . So does this not at least show you that to grow up big and strong we as humans too can gain all of the nutrients and dietary requirements solely from plant sources alone? Of course it does – common sense confirms this statement plus there have been countless studies with much evidence to show that a pure vegetarian diet is one of the healthiest choices you can make for you, the animals and the planet. </p>
<p> And about the augument that ‘vegetarians don’t get enough protein’ Plant foods offer abundant protein. Vegetables are around 23% protein on average, beans 28%, grains 13%, and even fruit has 5.5%. For comparison, human breast milk is only 6% (designed for the time in our lives when our protein needs are as high as they’ll ever be). Professional recommendations for adults range from 2.5% to 10%, and plant foods supply that easily. </p>
<p> People should be free to choose what they will eat. </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> We live in a country that is supposed to be about individual freedom. Unfortunately we have seen a gradual erosion of those freedoms. Now there are those who would impose upon others their moralities and ideas of what people should and shouldn’t eat. I would challenge, in particular, those who come from a moral standpoint. I would wager that many people who think it is immoral to eat meat are also the same people who think abortion is okay. If I am against abortion, (which I haven’t said one way or another) shouldn’t I be able to force my moral values on you? For that matter, there are many societal issues people on many sides could challenge from a “moral” standpoint. </p>
<p> When we are debating about whether people should eat meat strictly from a nutritional viewpoint, vegetarians fall apart in their arguments, as you will read in the other points discussed from a nutritional standpoint. The problem is not with meat per se. The problem expressed by many who say “don’t eat meat” is with how animals are raised, how they are fed, and how they are slaughtered. However, passing a law that says you cannot eat meat is short-sighted.. In a free society, we are free to buy or not buy products that we have an issue with, without imposing our morals and choices on others. If you don’t like how a particular corporation or farmer raises, feeds and slaughters the animals, then don’t buy their meat. Or, go through the proper legal channels to get regulations passed to change their practices. Don’t just legislate that people can’t eat meat anymore. That is a personal diet, as well as moral, choice. Personally, practicing “fair chase” and obeying the laws when hunting and making sure an animal is killed quickly and humanely is how we come by our venison, which we choose to eat over beef because we know the animal has lived and eaten natural foods. Another choice could be to buy from organically operated farms which raise animals in an environment as close to natural as possible, with the animals being able to roam freely in clean areas with natural foods to eat. </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> Meat is inefficient </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> We live in a world where the population is rising rapidly, and at the same time is getting wealthier. Both of these trends lead to rises in consumption of food, and especially in foods that are more expensive such a meat. However meat is unsustainable as a food source for humanity. Most livestock are not are not pasture fed but are fed grain and soya. A pound of beef takes 7 pounds of feed to produce. For pork, the ratio is 1 to 3; and for chicken, 1 to 2.[[Moises Velasquez-Manoff, Diet for a more crowded planet: Plants, Christian Science Monitor, 18th July 2008, http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/217/46216.html%5D%5D None of these ratios are sustainable for a planet where we need to feed more people, and where we need to reduce CO2 emissions so can’t keep chopping down rainforests to convert to pastures for grazing. The amount of nutrients one would acquire by eating the grain and soya directly is far greater than that achieved by feeding it to livestock. Indeed if everyone ate the same amount of meat as Americans do our current harvests would only sustain a global population of 2.5billion people whereas we have a population of 6.5 billion people. In short we need to eat vegetables not meat. </p>
<p> The warning about meat and the environment isn’t coming from crazed hippies. It’s coming from people like the head of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who has openly identified eating less meat as an important step in combatting climate change. Why? Because cows are more damaging than cars. </p>
<p> Livestock production requires enormous amounts of energy. We put far more energy into animals per unit of food than we do for any plant crop. The main reason is that cattle consume 16 times as much grain as they produce as meat, so right there we have 16 times as much energy just to grow those crops, just so we can waste them on livestock. </p>
<p> But the energy use doesn’t end there. The livestock themselves take energy to process beyond the energy that goes into their feed. And then there’s refrigeration, including during transport, necessary for meat but not for grains and beans. And then there’s the transportation itself. </p>
<p> Wasting energy isn’t problematic just because there’s less and less of it to go around. (We’ve already used more than half the oil that exists on the planet.) It’s also a problem because burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming. And raising animals for food is the driving force. As the U.K.’s Independent put it: </p>
<p> “Livestock are responsible for 18 per cent of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, more than cars, planes and all other forms of transport put together.” That figure comes from no less authority than the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. </p>
<p> WATER </p>
<p> Meat production requires so much water it’s hard to comprehend. , a pound of potatoes takes 99.6% less water to produce than a pound of beef, and 97% less than a ound of chicken. </p>
<p> If you gave up showering, you’d save less water than what’s required to make a single pound of beef. Not beef for a whole year, just one miserable pound. A whole year’s worth of showers takes about 5,200 gallons, but it takes 5,214 gallons to produce a single pound of beef. you gave up beef, you’d save over 300,000 gallons a year. A whole lot more than you could save by never showering. </p>
<p> When land is used to raise animals instead of crops, precious water and soil are lost, trees are cut down to make land for grazing or factory-farm sheds, and untreated animal waste pollutes rivers and streams. In fact, it has such a devastating effect on all aspects of our environment that the Union of Concerned Scientists lists meat-eating as the second-biggest environmental hazard facing the Earth. (Number one is fossil-fuel vehicles). No wonder, when you consider facts like these: </p>
<p> * Cows must consume 16 pounds of vegetation in order to convert them into 1 pound of flesh. Raising animals for food consumes more than half of all water used in the U.S. It takes 2,500 gallons of water to produce a pound of meat, but only 25 gallons to produce a pound of wheat. A totally vegetarian diet equires 300 gallons of water per day, while a meat-eating diet requires more than 4,000 gallons of water per day. </p>
<p> * Producing just one hamburger uses enough fossil fuel to drive a small car 20 miles. Of all raw materials and fossil fuels used in the U.S., more than one-third are used to raise animals for food. </p>
<p> * A typical pig factory generates the same amount of raw waste as a city of 12,000 people. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, raising animals for food is the number one source of water pollution. </p>
<p> * Of all agricultural land in the U.S., 87 percent is used to raise animals for food. That’s 45 percent of the total land mass in the U.S. About 260 million acres of U.S. forest have been cleared to create cropland to produce feed for animals raised for food. The meat industry is directly responsible for 85 percent of all soil erosion in the U.S. </p>
<p> * More than 80 percent of the corn we grow and more than 95 percent of the oats are fed to livestock. The world’’s cattle alone consume a quantity of food equal to the caloric needs of 8.7 billion people—more than the entire human population on Earth. According to the Worldwatch Institute, “Roughly 2 of every 5 tons of grain produced in the world is fed to livestock, poultry, or fish; decreasing consumption of these products, especially of beef, could free up massive quantities of grain and reduce pressure on land.” </p>
<p> To produce 1 lb. of feedlot beef requires 7 lbs. of feed grain, which takes 7,000 lbs. of water to grow.” Note that he equates 7,000 pounds of water to raising just one pound of beef to maturity. Considering many feedlot cows can end up weighing well over 1,000 pounds, it’s not hard to see how much water is used to simply fatten up cows for slaughter. </p>
<p> Some people don’t know that methane is also a large contributor to global warming. The Vegetarian Times Complete Cookbook cites John Robbins’s arguments that cattle on the planet “produce nearly 100 million tons of methane.” </p>
<p> The first is that land (such as rainforest) is cleared to grow grain to feed cattle; the second is that land is also cleared to raise cattle. They mention that one “third of the world’s land suitable for growing crops is used to produce feed for farmed animals.” It is “inefficient” to use land to feed animals that become food for human beings when using the land to directly feed people would result in more food and less land use. </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> There are large numbers of livestock particularly sheep and goats graze on land that would not be suitable for any other type of farming. Therefore if they are just living off land that would otherwise not be used for farming the production of their meat is efficient and not directly competing with grain for land. This renders any comparison between grain and meat invalid. Furthermore, one can’t equate different foods and make comparisons of how efficient or inefficient foods might be – there’s a big difference in the kinds of nutrients that human beings can derive out of meat, which cannot be given through any amount of grain. </p>
<p> Water use </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> Due to the same phenomenon of meat being inefficient to produce in terms of the amount of grain needed to produce the same weight of meat, production requires a lot of water. Water is another scarce resource that we will soon not have enough of in various areas of the globe. Grain-fed beef production takes 100,000 liters of water for every kilogram of food. Raising broiler chickens takes 3,500 liters of water to make a kilogram of meat. In comparison, soybean production uses 2,000 liters for kilogram of food produced; rice, 1,912; wheat, 900; and potatoes, 500 liters.[[Roger Segelken, U.S. could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat, Cornell Science News, 7th August 1997, http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/aug97/livestock.hrs.html%5D%5D This is while there are areas of the globe that have severe water shortages. With farming using up to 70 times more water than is used for domestic purposes: cooking and washing. A third of the population of the world is already suffering from a shortage of water. Groundwater levels are falling all over the world and rivers are beginning to dry up.[[Fiona Harvey, Water scarcity affects one in three, FT.com, 21st August 2003, http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3e3eeab2-3137-11db-b953-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=fc2aebdc-32a6-11db-87ac-0000779e2340.html%5D%5D Already some of the biggest rivers such as China’s Yellow river do not reach the sea.[[Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, Yellow river ‘drying up’, BBC News, 29th July 2-004, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3937403.stm%5D%5D </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> This does not seem to be an argument against eating meat, rather an argument against either farming meat or animals being alive in general. </p>
<p> On farming meat, this is not efficient, however thsi does not mean we shouldn;t eat meat it means we should look at makinf more efficient farms or smaller, more localized farms. We shouldn’t however simply stop farming and either slaughter the animals currently there or just let them free, because lets face it, animals will always drink water. </p>
<p> If the Opp is trying to say that using water on animals is inherently bad then there is a much bigger problem than simply eating meat. </p>
<p> All the statisics being used highligh the issue that animals drink water. Yes this is true, tehy need to to survive, tehre is no conclusion on wetehr we should stop eating meat, this point os more of a fun fact. If indeedwater supply is limited we need to look at ways to make things more efficient, this does not mean we should abandon eating a large part of the human diet. </p>
<p> Environment </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> As a result of the above point producing meat damages the environment. The demand for meat drives deforestation. Daniel Cesar Avelino of Brazil’s Federal Public Prosecution Office says “We know that the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon is cattle.” This clearing of tropical rainforests such as the Amazon for agriculture is estimated to produce 17% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.[[David Adam, Supermarket suppliers ‘helping to destroy Amazon rainforest’, The Guardian, 21st June 2009, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jun/21/supermarket-suppliers-amazon-rainforest-deforestation%5D%5D Not only this but the production of meat takes a lot more energy than it ultimately gives us chicken meat production consumes energy in a 4:1 ratio to protein output; beef cattle production requires an energy input to protein output ratio of 54:1.[[Roger Segelken, U.S. could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat, Cornell Science News, 7th August 1997, http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/aug97/livestock.hrs.html%5D%5D </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> Ethical arguments in favor of eating necesarily lead down a slippery slope. </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> Answer these questions: </p>
<p> If a cow had more than enough grass to survive and even live happily with, and this cow decided to eat you, a human being, would such a cow be permitted to do so? </p>
<p> If a human being had the same mental composition of a cow (no morals, very very dumb, etc), should other humans be allowed to eat him (in a non-survival situation)? What if this human tasted as good as cows? Does that change anything? </p>
<p> In response to your answers: </p>
<p> 1) Lions are not exactly permitted to eat humans in our society. If this occurs anywhere except for in isolated nature, the animal would most likely be round and destroyed (think Jaws for an example with a shark). </p>
<p> 2) There are many examples of animals eating their own species. “Cannibalism has commonly been observed in the wild for a variety of taxa, including octopus, bats, toads, fish, monitor lizards, red-backed salamanders and several stream salamanders, crocodiles, spiders, crustaceans, birds (crows, barred owls), mammals, and a vast number of insects, such as dragonflies, diving beetles, back swimmers, water striders, flour beetles, caddisflies and many more”. [(http://www.whereincity.com/india-kids/animals/)] </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> In answer to the first question: yes, the cow would be permitted to eat me, just like lions are permitted to eat me, however I would be able to fight back. As long as the world was built for it- it’s okay. </p>
<p> In answer to the second question: it is not normal for a member of a species to eat another member. If a cow would eat another cow it would get mad cow disease. The rules of nature do not allow us to eat cows only because they are “dumber” than us, but also because they are of a different species. As long as BOTH those conditions remain- you’re okay. </p>
<p> No, </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> Because human teeth are not like carnivores ? Everything is clear we eat meat because it is easily available…the animal we kill can’t say a word..he/she can not explain his pain…there is no need of scientific explanation because it is exact similar like some one chop off your tongue and cut your one hand for his food so you can just feel the pain but you can not do anything ? In many religion its valid i don’t know why because god created everything equally without biasing but human always try to disturb the harmony between souls…they don’t have reason why they eat meat they said its just mention in book its halal..i cow got a full life to live one earth but a man killed it at an age of 5 years so its not gods fault that he made it for sacrifice or serving it in hotels its only man who killed it not god gave this over…if man asked to eat lion i am sure he will n’t make it because he on’t have guts to kill lion he can kill cow boz she is helpless… I am always open for debate on non veg and veg… </p>
<p> Dharmender Karhana </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> Human teeth are not like carnivores then what are they like? omnivores? Because we, meat eaters can still eat both vegetarian and non vegetarian dish? Then you are talking about the availability of the meat. Are plants not easily available? And what would you do in case scientists develop something which can help plants speak too? And for your information let me tell you that this has already taken place. And what would you do when such a speaking plant tells you, “Hey! vegan! don’t eat me, I’m here to be eaten by a herbivore rather than you humans!” ? Though I do not support the cannibalism associated with the animals, but that should not deprive us of eating animals. The question here is for those people who involve themselves in such brutal acts towards our fellow animals. There exists a thing called “food chain” in the nature which doesn’t allow or you can say we, humans are not that easily able to kill an animal like lion and the same thing applies to a deer. </p>
<p> Source to support that plants can speak too http://www.thehindu.com/arts/magazine/article3500338.ece This article also talks about the brutality towards animals and rather gives the meat eaters like me who eat meat but at the same time have a concern towards their environment a choice to eat artificially produced( in the laboratories by scientists) meat. </p>

<p> vegetarians visit hospitals 22% less often than meat eaters </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> he healthiness of a vegetarian diet is perhaps shown most dramatically by the fact that lifelong vegetarians visit hospitals 22% less often than meat eaters – and for shorter stays! Vegetarians tend to be fitter than meat eaters – as well as healthier – and many of the world’s most successful athletes follow a strictly vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> The farming of animals causes suffering. Causing suffering is wrong. The farming of animals is wrong </p>
<p> No because… </p>
<p> Animals have a range of cognitive abilities that are suggestive of consciousness. This includes associative/non-elemental learning and episodic-like memory, the ability to remember the “what, where and when” of an event. This suggest animals such as mice can create new representations of the world in novel combinations, binding together different sensory modalities in the same way that consciousness binds together our experiences. Animals can feel pain, and feel emotion in response to that pain that affects their ability to learn in much the same way as in humans. </p>
<p> The life of a farmed animal is filled with pain. This may include being branded with scolding iron, castration and being de-horned all without pain relief. Many factory farmed animals will be forced to live in cramped and dirty conditions without the opportunity for much exercise or environment enrichment. In the dairy industry after giving birth, calves will be forcibly removed from their mother. After a short life of being made pregnant, having their calves forcibly removed and being milked at a high intensity many dairy cows can get mastitis(a very painful udder infection) and have reduced milk production and are then killed. Some of those male calves are then used for veal. Those cows used for beef are transported in poor cramped condition’s in lorries to the slaughter house. The capacitive bolt is not a humane method of inducing permanent unconsciousness before killing, the prevalence of a shallow depth of concussion after being hit with the bolt in one study was 7.7% for all cattle, and 15.1% for young bulls. [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174007001544]] This suggests many cows could regain consciousness before being slaughtered. </p>
<p> These animals are psychologically damaged by these experiences. One animal model of depression in rodents is enforced separation of pups from the mother. These animals show a reduced performance in a forced swim test, ie they stop trying to tread water and escape from a tank of water and instead enter a state of despair. Another way of inducing depression in animals is the chronic mild stress model that involves the exposure of animals to a series of mild and unpredictable stressors and results in long lasting changes of behavioural and neurological function that can be reversed with antidepressants, just like in humans. </p>
<p> If one values psychological well being of sentient animals then one must also oppose the eating of meat. </p>
<p> Yes because… </p>
<p> The issue is whether people should eat meat or not. From a nutritional and free choice standpoint, the answer is people should be able to choose whether or not to eat meat, and not be subject to any law which would ban the eating of meat. (See the arguments for nutrition in this debate). Those who say “no” from an environmental/moral standpoint are extending this argument which, in my opinion, belongs in another debate. However, to answer the rebuttal to my argument (to the right), his/her argument is more about the practices associated with (in particular) factory farms. I have studied and viewed documentaries concerning factory farm practices, and agree with many of the things my opponent has to say. However, we tread on dangerous ground when we offer the simplistic solution of not eating meat. There are many who would legislate what we put into our own bodies. Freedom in this country means the freedom to eat what we choose to eat (other than cannibalism). We go down a slippery slope when we begin to legislate what people can eat. We are already on a slippery slope, in my opinion, as more laws are passed and government gains more control over the lives of citizens. </p>
<p> The answer to the problem outlined above, and by my opponent, is to go through the proper legislative channels to improve regulations concerning how factory farms operate. In the meantime, you can choose not to eat meat, or to buy meat from those corporations and farmers whose practices you approve of. Personally, I choose to eat wild game because it comes from a natural environment in which the animals have eaten natural foods. These range of choices allow us to preserve the freedom to choose what we put in our bodies, including the freedom to do business with those who engage in humane farming practices, as well as the freedom to present legislation to change the inhumane practices of factory farms. </p>
<p> I think it’s well proven that humans can live without animal protein. Most of us don’t want a dead carcass on our plates or the guilt of an animal death on our conscience. Let’s face it, most meat is not raised in humane conditions now and people are eating that. I grew up on a ranch/farm, animals aren’t raised that way anymore. Most are held on factory farms and cruel places who don’t care about an animal’s well being. They clip the wings of chickens and turkeys so they can’t fly, they cut off their beaks and shove as many animals as they can in a barn. They fatten them up on GMO grains and then send them off to slaughter without a blink of an eye. When all those hurricanes hit North Carolina a few years ago they didn’t even bother assisting all those animals in the barns and they all drowned along with the toxic excrement ponds being flooded back into the water systems. We only have a contract to eat fish from a spiritual perspective and our bodies were not created for meat protein – wrong teeth, long colon and we don’t secrete the proper enzymes to break animal protein down in our bodies. One thing I can say, if you’re raising your vibrational frequency, your diet will change along with it. You no longer want to eat meat and that is a good thing. </p>

<p> The farming of animals causes suffering. Causing suffering is wrong. The farming of animals is wrong Animals have a range of cognitive abilities that are suggestive of consciousness. This includes associative/non-elemental learning and episodic-like memory, the ability to remember the “what, where and when” of an event. This suggests animals such as mice can create new representations of the world in novel combinations, binding together different sensory modalities in the same way that consciousness binds together our experiences. Animals can feel pain, and feel the emotion in response to that pain that affects their ability to learn in much the same way as in humans. </p>
<p> The life of a farmed animal is filled with pain. This may include being branded with scolding iron, castration and being de-horned all without pain relief. Many factories farmed animals will be forced to live in cramped and dirty conditions without the opportunity for many exercises or environmental enrichment. In the dairy industry after giving birth, calves will be forcibly removed from their mother. After a short life of being made pregnant, having their calves forcibly removed and being milked at a high-intensity many dairy cows can get mastitis(a very painful udder infection) and have reduced milk production and are then killed. Some of those male calves are then used for veal. Those cows used for beef are transported in poor cramped condition’s in lorries to the slaughterhouse. The capacitive bolt is not a humane method of inducing permanent unconsciousness before killing, the prevalence of a shallow depth of concussion after being hit with the bolt in one study was 7.7% for all cattle, and 15.1% for young bulls. [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174007001544]] This suggests many cows could regain consciousness before being slaughtered. </p>
<p> These animals are psychologically damaged by these experiences. One animal model of depression in rodents is enforced separation of pups from the mother. These animals show a reduced performance in a forced swim test, ie they stop trying to tread water and escape from a tank of water and instead enter a state of despair. Another way of inducing depression in animals is the chronic mild stress model that involves the exposure of animals to a series of mild and unpredictable stressors and results in long-lasting changes of behavioural and neurological function that can be reversed with antidepressants, just like in humans. </p>
<p> If one values psychological well being of sentient animals then one must also oppose the eating of meat. </p>

<p> No because: In modern society eating meat is by no means an act of survival but of personal pleasure, in most cases that is. Not only this but we have created, to some extent, a world for our consumption. We impregnate cows so that they will produce children, which if male will either be killed or sold as a mating bull or if female will be sent to the beginning of a long chain of milk cows, and produce milk; which we drink. After a new milk cow has been bought another cow is killed, which we eat. We are forcing nature to take place within the walls of our barns and behind the fences of our stys; we are bringing life into this world simply to forcibly impregnate it years on end or to simply slaughter it after a miserable life of darkness, gloom and seclusion. I don’t necessarily believe that the human race consuming animal flesh is an atrocious notion, but I believe what we have made and created is. Regardless, it has been proven that that teeth of humans relate closest to herbivores rather than carnivores. In conclusion I believe the production of meat in modern society and the sheer amount we consume is the main problem. </p>

<p> No because: Animals are made up of flesh and blood like us. They are an inferior life-form alright but they do have all their senses; of love, of pain, of anger, of fear etc. They reciprocate when you love them. They are loving companions so why after all they should be ruthlessly murdered for food? We are human beings, we are not living in a jungle, so the rules of jungle should not apply. Just because they have a weak defense and can’t run away we give them so much pain. No argument in the world can justify this cruelty on any living being. They have a right to live their natural life…….SO, I want the whole world to stop killing animals right now!!!! I appeal to all powerful people in the world to declare it a crime. Thank you.. </p>

<p> 9 Fruits You Should Eat Every Day </p>
<p> Though most nutrition experts don't like to categorize foods (or fruits in particular) into “good” and “bad” category, a general agreement suggests there are fruits that should be implemented into a daily diet more than others. </p>
<p> Though we generally tend to believe all fruits and fruit products are healthful, some should be approached with caution. Though most nutrition experts do not like to categorize foods (or fruits in particular) into “good” and “bad” category, a general agreement suggests there are fruits that should be implemented into a daily diet more than others. </p>
<p> Bite into These Best Fruits to Eat </p>
<p> 1. Apples </p>
<p> When it comes to eating apples, eat the whole product. The totality of an apple contains both insoluble fiber (promoted for digestive health) and soluble fiber (encouraged for lowering cholesterol). The fiber content and antioxidant properties apples contain ultimately creates a powerful combination to lower the risk of cancer, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. </p>
<p> 2. Bananas </p>
<p> Though individuals may scurry away from bananas relative to their sugar content, bananas are quite beneficial when it comes to easing digestion and offering high amounts of potassium. Being naturally low in sodium and high in potassium, bananas can foster healthy blood pressure levels. </p>
<p> 3. Blueberries </p>
<p> These small berries are nothing less than mighty! Blueberries contain some of the most powerful antioxidants within the food supply. Antioxidants keep cells healthy, thus minimizing chronic disease and maximizing longevity. Eat blueberries on their own or sprinkle into oats or yogurt! </p>
<p> 4. Grapes </p>
<p> Specifically, red and purple grapes, as they contain higher amounts of resveratrol much like red wine. Resveratrol is a powerful antioxidant that fights against cellular damage and may reduce the risk of heart disease. </p>
<p> 5. Lemons </p>
<p> Though simply biting into a lemon on its own is up to an individual’s own discretion, incorporating this fruit into the daily diet can be quite beneficial. The freshness of squeeze lemon naturally flavors food products while igniting a sense of energy, limiting the need for sugary, caffeinated “pick-me-ups!” </p>
<p> 6. Olives </p>
<p> Though treated mostly as a vegetable, olives are technically a fruit! Olives bring much more than natural sugars to the table, as they are recommended for their healthy fat contribution as well as iron content. Healthy fats are shown to be heart-protective while iron oxygenates blood, dynamically constructing a h3 cardiovascular system. </p>
<p> 7. Oranges </p>
<p> Just one orange serving drives home a whole day’s worth of vitamin C! Also offering potassium, oranges are a refreshing, low-calorie fruit to eat in your daily meal intake! </p>
<p> 8. Pears </p>
<p> Commonly hidden behind apples, pears should take the spotlight, too! They are also high in fiber while offering potassium and vitamin C. When it comes to the best pears for eating, consume ones found in fresh produce bins rather than the ones found in the aisles. Canned pears are likely to be absent of their fiber-filled skin while soaking in syrups and added sugars </p>
<p> 9. Tomatoes </p>
<p> Tomatoes are low in calorie but packed with nutrients. They are most noted for their high lycopene content, a pigment responsible for tomato’s red color and may reduce blood pressure. When choosing tomato products such as ketchup and pasta sauce, be leery of added sugar and salt. </p>
<p> It is important to understand all fruits fit into a well-balanced diet! But even more importantly, consume the whole product rather than fruit juices and concentrates. These fruit products generally offer nothing more than sugar, as they are often stripped out of fiber and nutrients. Two to three servings of fruit each day is commonly recommended! </p>

<p> Adolf Hitler and vegetarianism </p>
<p> Towards the end of his life, Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) followed a vegetarian diet. It is not clear when or why he adopted it, since some accounts of his dietary habits prior to the Second World War indicate that he consumed meat as late as 1937. By 1938, Hitler's public image as a vegetarian was already being fostered, and from 1942, he self-identified as a vegetarian. Personal accounts from people who knew Hitler and were familiar with his diet indicate that he did not consume meat as part of his diet during this period, as several contemporaneous witnesses—such as Albert Speer (in his memoirs, Inside the Third Reich)—noted that Hitler used vivid and gruesome descriptions of animal suffering and slaughter at the dinner table to try to dissuade his colleagues from eating meat. An examination of Hitler's skull carried out by French scientists in 2017 found no traces of meat fibre in the tartar on Hitler's teeth. </p>
<p> Some modern-day analyses have speculated that Hitler's vegetarianism may have been for health reasons due to Richard Wagner's historical theories, or even a psychological reaction to his niece's death rather than a commitment to animal welfare. In contrast, several eyewitness sources maintain Hitler was a vegetarian because of his concern for animal suffering, noting that he was often distressed by images of animal cruelty and suffering, and was an antivivisectionist. </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> Do you know that your Führer is a vegetarian, and that he does not eat meat because of his general attitude toward life and his love for the world of animals? Do you know that your Führer is an exemplary friend of animals, and even as a chancellor, he is not separated from the animals he has kept for years?...The Führer is an ardent opponent of any torture of animals, in particular vivisection, and has declared to terminate those conditions...thus fulfilling his role as the savior of animals, from continuous and nameless torments and pain. </p>
<p> In a 1937 article, The New York Times noted "It is well known that Hitler is a vegetarian and does not drink or smoke. The lunch and dinner consist, therefore, for the most part of soup, eggs, vegetables and mineral water, although he occasionally relishes a slice of ham and relieves the tediousness of his diet with such delicacies as caviar ...".[2] In November 1938, an article for the English magazine Homes & Gardens describing Hitler's mountain home, The Berghof, stated that in addition to being a teetotaler and a non-smoker, Hitler was also a vegetarian. Ignatius Phayre wrote, "A life-long vegetarian at table, Hitler's kitchen plots are both varied and heavy in produce. Even in his meatless diet Hitler is something of a gourmet – as Sir John Simon and Anthony Eden were surprised to note when they dined with him in the Chancellery at Berlin. His Bavarian chef, Herr Kannenberg, contrives an imposing array of vegetarian dishes, savoury and rich, pleasing to the eye as well as to the palate, and all conforming to the dietic standards which Hitler exacts."[3] </p>
<p> According to stenographic transcripts translated by Hugh Trevor-Roper of conversations between Hitler and his inner circle which took place between July 1941 and November 1944, Hitler regarded himself as a vegetarian. These conversations were gathered together under the title Hitler's Table Talk. Written notes taken at the time were transcribed and then were edited by Martin Bormann.[4] According to these transcripts dated 11 November 1941, Hitler said, "One may regret living at a period when it's impossible to form an idea of the shape the world of the future will assume. But there's one thing I can predict to eaters of meat: the world of the future will be vegetarian." On 12 January 1942, he said, "The only thing of which I shall be incapable is to share the sheiks' mutton with them. I'm a vegetarian, and they must spare me from their meat."[5] In a diary entry dated 26 April 1942, Joseph Goebbels described Hitler as a committed vegetarian, writing, </p>
<p> An extended chapter of our talk was devoted by the Führer to the vegetarian question. He believes more than ever that meat-eating is harmful to humanity. Of course he knows that during the war we cannot completely upset our food system. After the war, however, he intends to tackle this problem also. Maybe he is right. Certainly the arguments that he adduces in favor of his standpoint are very compelling.[6] </p>
<p> In his table talks, on 25 April 1942 at midday, Hitler addressed the issue of vegetarianism and spoke about Roman soldiers eating fruits and cereals and the importance of raw vegetables. He placed the emphasis on scientific arguments such as naturalists' observations and chemical efficacy.[7] Hitler also disapproved of cosmetics, since they contained animal by-products, and he frequently teased Eva Braun about her habit of wearing makeup.[5] Braun was also fond of turtle soup and notes from the interrogation of Hitler's personal aides about his daily routine in 1944 reveal that after midnight she would "direct that there should be another light snack of turtle soup, sandwiches, and sausages".[8][9] </p>
<p> Hitler tolerated [Marlene von Exner]'s reproaches and remained kindly and thoughtful. He liked her lively manner, was very fond of Viennese puddings, and admired her skill in making vegetarian soups that tasted better than meat broth. He couldn’t guess that poor Marlene was unhappy about his modest demands. With Antonescu, despite his diet, she had been able to revel in lobster, mayonnaise, caviar and other delicacies, and she had cooked fine dinners for festive receptions. But Hitler, as usual, wanted nothing but his one-pot dishes, carrots with potatoes. 'He’ll never thrive on food like this,’ she wailed, and she simmered a bone in his soup now and then. </p>
<p> — Traudl Junge, Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary (2004) </p>
<p> All accounts by people familiar with Hitler's diet from 1942 onwards are in agreement that Hitler adhered to a vegetarian diet, but accounts of his diet prior to the Second World War are inconsistent in this regard with some stating he ate meat. Dione Lucas, a chef at a Hamburg hotel patronised by Hitler prior to the war, claimed that her stuffed squab was a favourite of his.[10] According to Ilse Hess (wife of Rudolf Hess), in 1937, Hitler ceased eating meat except for liver dumplings.[11] Margot Wölk, who became his unwilling food taster in 1942, stated that all the food she tested for Hitler was vegetarian, and she recalled no meat or fish.[12][13] This account was backed up in 2017 when Russia's Federal Security Service granted permission to a team of French scientists to undertake an examination of Hitler's bones. An analysis of the tartar deposits found on the Führer's teeth and dentures found no traces of meat fibre.[14][15][16] </p>
<p> Traudl Junge, who became Hitler's secretary in 1942, reported that he "always avoided meat" but that his Austrian cook Kruemel sometimes added a little animal broth or fat to his meals. "Mostly the Fuehrer would notice the attempt at deception, would get very annoyed and then get tummy ache," Junge said. "At the end he would only let Kruemel cook him clear soup and mashed potato."[17] In addition, Marlene von Exner, who became Hitler's dietitian in 1943, reportedly added bone marrow to his soups without his knowledge because she "despised" his vegetarian diet.[18] </p>
<p> Even though Hitler adhered to a vegetarian diet during this period, his physician, Theodor Morell, administered many unorthodox medications that contained animal by-products from 1936 until Hitler's death in 1945. These included Glyconorm (an injectable compound containing cardiac muscle, adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas), placenta, bovine testosterone, and extracts containing seminal vesicles and prostate. At the time, extracts from animal glands were popularly believed to be "elixirs of youth", but it is not known if Hitler requested them or if he blindly accepted them.[19] </p>
<p> Prior to the Second World War, there are many accounts of Hitler's eating meat (including stuffed squab and Bavarian sausages) and caviar.[10][20] According to Ilse Hess, in 1937 Hitler ceased eating all meat except for liver dumplings,[11] an account that Dr. Kalechofsky found "consistent with other descriptions of Hitler's diet, which always included some form of meat, whether ham, sausages or liver dumplings."[21] Frau Hess's comments are also backed up by several biographies about Hitler, with Fritz Redlich noting that Hitler "avoided any kind of meat, with the exception of an Austrian dish he loved, Leberknödl (liver dumpling)".[22] Thomas Fuchs concurred, observing that a "typical day's consumption included eggs prepared in any number of ways, spaghetti, baked potatoes with cottage cheese, oatmeal, stewed fruits and vegetable puddings. Meat was not completely excluded. Hitler continued to eat a favourite dish, Leberkloesse (liver dumplings)."[23] </p>
<p> Today, it is acknowledged by historians that Hitler—at least during the war—followed a vegetarian diet.[24][25] Several theories have been put forward for Hitler's transition to vegetarianism. The psychoanalyst Erich Fromm speculated that Hitler's vegetarianism was actually a means of atoning for the death of his half-niece Geli Raubal, as well as a means of proving to himself and others that he was incapable of killing.[26] British historical biographer Robert Payne, in his book The Life and Death of Adolph Hitler (Praeger, 1973) believed that Hitler's diet was ascetic and deliberately fostered by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels to emphasize Hitler's self-control and total dedication to Germany.[27] Rynn Berry—an authority on vegetarian history—supported the notion that Hitler's vegetarianism was "a marketing scheme concocted by Nazi propagandists" who wished to create a better public perception of Hitler, and was mostly due to health reasons rather than moral ones (noting his fondness for liver dumplings), concluding that "Hitler was in no way an ethical vegetarian".[25] </p>
<p> Other evidence suggests that Hitler—also an antivivisectionist—may have followed his selective diet out of a profound concern for animals.[28] At social events, he sometimes gave graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make his dinner guests shun meat.[18] In the BBC series The Nazis: A Warning from History, an eyewitness account tells of Hitler watching movies (which he did very often). If ever a scene showed (even fictional) cruelty to or death of an animal, Hitler would cover his eyes and look away until someone alerted him the scene was over. Alexander Cockburn also wrote of Hitler: </p>
<p> Nazi leaders were noted for love of their pets and for certain animals, notably apex predators like the wolf and the lion. Hitler, a vegetarian and hater of hunting, adored dogs and spent some of his final hours in the company of Blondi, whom he would take for walks outside the bunker at some danger to himself. He had a particular enthusiasm for birds and most of all for wolves. [...] Goebbels said, famously, 'The only real friend one has in the end is the dog. . . The more I get to know the human species, the more I care for my Benno.' Goebbels also agreed with Hitler that 'meat eating is a perversion in our human nature,' and that Christianity was a 'symptom of decay', since it did not urge vegetarianism. [...] On the one hand, monsters of cruelty towards their fellow humans; on the other, kind to animals and zealous in their interest. In their very fine essay on such contradictions, Arnold Arluke and Boria Sax offer three observations. One, as just noted, many Nazi leaders harboured affection towards animals but antipathy to humans. Hitler was given films by a maharaja which displayed animals killing people. The Führer watched with equanimity. Another film showed humans killing animals. Hitler covered his eyes and begged to be told when the slaughter was over.[29] </p>
<p> Hitler feeding deer, in a photograph captioned "Der Führer als Tierfreund" ("The leader as an animal lover") </p>
<p> It has also been theorized that Hitler's diet may have been based on Richard Wagner's historical theories[30] which connected the future of Germany with vegetarianism.[31] In the book, The Mind of Adolf Hitler by psychologist Walter C. Langer, the author speculates: </p>
<p> "If he (Hitler) does not eat meat, drink alcoholic beverages, or smoke, it is not due to the fact that he has some kind of inhibition or does it because he believes it will improve his health. He abstains from these because he is following the example of the great German, Richard Wagner, or because he has discovered that it increases his energy and endurance to such a degree that he can give much more of himself to the creation of the new German Reich."[32] </p>
<p> Despite Hitler's plans to convert Germany to vegetarianism after the war,[12] some authors have questioned Hitler's commitment to the vegetarian cause due to the Nazi ban on vegetarian societies and the persecution of their leaders.[33] However, the Nazi ban of non-Nazi organizations was widespread: all opposition political parties were banned,[34] independent trade unions were replaced by Nazi equivalents,[35] while non-government organizations and associations ranging from women's groups to film societies were either dissolved or incorporated into new organizations under the control of the Nazi leadership.[36] The Nazi regime also introduced animal welfare laws which were unparalleled at the time.[37] </p>

He drank beer and diluted wine frequently, had a special fondness for Bavarian sausages and kept a mistress, Eva Braun, who lived with him quietly in the Berghof. There had been other discreet affairs with women. His asceticism was fiction invented by Goebbels to emphasize his total dedication, his self-control, the distance that separated him from other men.

<p> Advice about Eating Fish </p>
<p> For Women Who Are or Might Become Pregnant, Breastfeeding Mothers, and Young Children </p>
<p> With the release of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which includes dietary recommendations for children under age 2 years, FDA and EPA are reviewing the new guidelines to determine what updates to this advice may be needed. </p>
<p> FDA and EPA have issued advice regarding eating fish. This advice can help women who are pregnant or may become pregnant - as well as breastfeeding mothers and parents and caregivers feeding children 2 years and older - make informed choices when it comes to fish that are nutritious and safe to eat. This advice supports the recommendations of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, developed for people 2 years and older. For advice about feeding children under 2 years of age, you can consult the American Academy of Pediatrics. </p>
<p> The advice features a chart that makes it easier than ever to choose dozens of healthy and safe options and includes information about the nutritional value of fish. A set of frequently asked questions & answers provides more information on how to use the chart and additional tips for eating fish. </p>
<p> Eating fish‡ when pregnant or breastfeeding can provide health benefits. </p>
<p> Fish and other protein-rich foods have nutrients that can help your child’s growth and development. As part of a healthy eating pattern, eating fish may also offer heart health benefits and lower the risk of obesity. </p>
<p> Nutritional Value of Fish </p>
<p> At least 8 ounces of seafood (less for young children) per week based on a 2,000 calorie diet </p>
<p> Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to consume between 8 and 12 ounces of a variety of seafood per week, from choices that are lower in mercury. </p>
<p> More vitamin B12 and vitamin D than any other type of food </p>
<p> Iron which is important for infants, young children, and women who are pregnant or who could become pregnant </p>
<p> Other minerals like selenium, zinc, and iodine. </p>
<p> Choose a variety of fish that are lower in mercury. </p>
<p> While it is important to limit mercury in the diets of women who are pregnant and breastfeeding and young children, many types of fish are both nutritious and lower in mercury. </p>
<p> This chart can help you choose which fish to eat, and how often to eat them, based on their mercury levels. </p>
<p> What is a serving? As a guide, use the palm of your hand. </p>

<p> Finally! How long after wisdom teeth removal can I eat solid food </p>
<p> Wisdom teeth removal is a surgical process that is very serious. After the end of the surgery, the most common question that hits our mind is, how long after wisdom teeth removal can I eat solid food. </p>
<p> When you have any issue with your wisdom tooth-like pain or cavity, you should seek a dentist. The dentist will give you an appointment if your tooth needs to be removed. On your surgery day, make sure not to eat right before the time of your surgery and don’t even go on an empty stomach. Eat something an hour before your surgery. After the completion of the surgery, your mouth will remain numb for some time, but once the numbness ends, you feel hungry, and you start to think, how long after wisdom teeth removal can I eat solid food? </p>
<p> Eating food that is not good for your health at that time results in severe pain or bleeding from the affected area. Eat the right food, follow the instructions of your dentist, and you can follow the below list to add up a new taste in your food list while keeping in mind the precautionary measures. </p>
<p> Right after a wisdom tooth surgery, you can eat liquid and soft foods like: </p>
<p> Broth </p>
<p> You have to eat these foods for some time. We know that you are still worried about how long after wisdom teeth removal can I eat solid food? Let us explain the answer in the following paragraph. </p>
<p> How long after wisdom teeth removal can I eat solid food? </p>
<p> Depending on the procedure, you can eat solid food after one or two weeks of wisdom tooth removal. For instance, if your tooth removal was a complicated procedure and your dentist has told you that your tooth has two or three roots, then you cannot even eat soft foods, and you only have to take liquids for at least 24 hours. In addition, you can start eating solids after two weeks of surgery. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if your tooth has one root, then you can eat soft foods within 24 hours and start eating solids right after one week of surgery. </p>
<p> What not to eat </p>
<p> By soft foods or liquids, doesn’t mean to eat any kind of soft food or liquids. Following is a list of eatables to avoid after your wisdom tooth surgery: </p>
<p> DO NOT drink hot water, coffee, or any other hot liquid or food in the first 24 hours of surgery because, in the first 24 hours, a blood clot is forming over the surgical surface, and it can be removed if you eat or drink any hot food or liquid It might bring about some bleeding and can be painful. </p>
<p> DO NOT eat acidic, spicy, and sour foods and drinks for at least one week after the surgery. These foods can cause irritation due to the healing process that is not yet completed. </p>
<p> DO NOT drink alcohol for about a week after surgery. Alcohol sometimes reacts with tooth healing or pain relief medications, and you may feel severe pain or bleeding by having it. </p>
<p> DO NOT eat foods that have small particles or grains in it for at least two weeks. These particles can be stuck in your empty space of tooth and can cause infections. </p>
<p> DO NOT eat hard to chew foods for two weeks after the surgery, because they can cause the stitches to break and reopen your wound. </p>
<p> Even after you take all the precautionary measures and eat the right food, some complications may occur due to different reasons. </p>
<p> Complications after the tooth removal surgery </p>
<p> Although complications are not common, you may be subject to some complications after your surgery due to different reasons: </p>
<p> Blood fails to clot </p>
<p> Infections </p>
<p> Nerve damage </p>
<p> Allergic reaction </p>
<p> Blood fails to clot </p>
<p> Some times after your surgery, you may experience that your blood keeps on dripping from the affected area even after two to three days. In that case, seek your dentist immediately, and your dentist will install dry sockets or do any procedure that is good to give you relief from this issue. </p>
<p> Infections </p>
<p> Infections after surgery are common if someone will not take all the precautionary measures. </p>
<p> After surgery you must take care of yourself. </p>
<p> Nerve damage </p>
<p> If you pain continuous pain or numbness in your gum, it may be due to nerve damage. Nerve damage can occur during surgery, but it is not very common, and it will get better in a few weeks. </p>
<p> Allergic reactions </p>
<p> If you have trouble breathing, fever, rashes on the skin, etc. then it is can caused due to some allergic issues. You need to see your dentist, and he will identify the root cause and give you certain medicines or precautions for it. </p>
<p> You now have the answer to the question, how long after wisdom teeth removal can I eat solid food. It is very important to see a dentist if you feel any reaction and follow his footsteps. </p>

<p> List of Best Foods for Tegus </p>
<p> If you're thinking of buying a tegu or if you already own one, you may wonder, "What can I feed my tegu?" The answer is a balanced, varied diet of prey, meat, fruit, vegetables with appropriate supplements. </p>
<p> We often hear from owners who rely solely on easy (but unvaried!) diets, such as only scrambled eggs or leftover vegetable scraps. While these options will keep your tegu fed, they likely don't provide the valuable variety of nutrients which can lead to your Tegu living a happy and healthy life. </p>
<p> Below you'll find a full alphabetized list of food for tegus from our experience and research online. Looking for a varied diet that comes pre-prepared? Check out this collection of prepared, canned, and dried tegu food that you can use as part of your Tegu's healthy diet. </p>
<p> REMEMBER: Always balance fresh food with prepared foods! </p>
<p> Celery- low in nutrition </p>
<p> Coriander - in moderation, high in oxalates </p>
<p> Corn - feed rarely or never, low in Ca and high in Phosphorus </p>
<p> Cucumber - low in nutrition </p>
<p> Flowering plants like- Nasturtiums, Dahlia or hibiscus, - be careful of pesticides and herbicides </p>

<p> Other helpful tips about feeding your tegu </p>
<p> Feeding schedule: </p>
<p> Tegus are fast growers with active metabolisms, so regular feeding is important. Juvenal tegus should be fed daily - typically the amount of food that they can eat in about an hour. As they reach adulthood, tegus should be fed small, adequate meals several times a week (every other day or every second day). Decrease feeding during the winter when tegus hibernate. After each meal, clean up all leftover food from the enclosure. </p>
<p> We recommend feeding your tegu with tongs to prevent accidental finger biting! </p>

<p> This was extremely helpful! I’m shifting in-between getting a tegu or a monitor, so I am writing down information and then seeing in the end what the better option will be! I used to have a tortoise so my mom is very very very used to buying strange foods for animals (exotic animal family :) but anyway, thank you! </p>

<p> Well Kaz, you will for sure end up killing your monitor if you keep feeding canned at food. The gravy is far too fatty for them. I had a Savannah monitor that was fed canned cat food before I managed to get a hold of him, only to have him for less than a year before he passed. The gravy will cause fatty liver issues, that if they aren’t taken care of with a proper diet, will calcify and eventually killing off your monitor. Very painfully I may add. NOBODY LISTEN TO THAT AND FEED ONLY WHOLE OR FOODS PRODUCED FOR MONITORS. YOU WILL KILL THEM WITH CAT FOOD. Save yourself a huge vet bill and heartache of you killing your animal slowly and just do some research on proper diets. </p>

<p> A List of Foods That Can Be Eaten Before a PET Scan </p>
<p> Written by Elizabeth Otto </p>

<p> Positron emission tomography, or a PET scan, is a type of nuclear medicine imaging that views the body and organs on a cellular level, according to RadiologyInfo.org. A PET scan measures body functions like blood flow, oxygen use and the metabolism of glucose, or sugar. Depending on the type of PET scan you have, following a low-carbohydrate diet 12 hours before the scan may be necessary to increase the quality of PET scan images. Foods you can eat are limited for this type of PET scan. </p>
<p> Meats </p>
<p> Begin your low-carbohydrate diet 12 hours before your scheduled PET scan unless otherwise instructed by your physician, suggests Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. All meats are allowed prior to a PET scan, including beef, chicken, pork and fish. Choose fresh, unbreaded meats to avoid carbohydrates. Bake, broil or grill meats and fish and do not add batter or breading. Tofu may also be eaten prior to a PET scan. </p>

<p> Why Do I Always Feel Sick After Eating? </p>
<p> Why Do I Always Feel Sick After Eating? </p>
<p> Food is supposed to be a pleasurable affair, but when every meal starts to make you feel sick food can quickly lose its natural appeal. There are a number of reasons you may feel sick after consuming a meal, which is why it can be tricky to uncover the proper diagnoses. In this blog we explain how the digestive system works, and where things can go wrong. Plus, we include a number of reasons you might be feeling sick after you eat. </p>
<p> How The Digestive System Works </p>
<p> When your body is experiencing healthy, normal functions it has a very sophisticated system for digesting food, allowing you to enjoy a varied diet without much repercussion. </p>
<p> Food travels from your mouth, down your esophagus and into your stomach at a relatively quick pace so that it can find its way to the intestines where digestion takes place. Nerves, bacteria, hormones, blood, and the hard organs of your digestive system all work together as a team to digest foods and liquids. </p>
<p> You may start to feel sick if there’s a hitch in the system and your body can’t properly break down food for some reason. Since your digestive system is a long and complex system, starting from your mouth and ending at your anus, there are many things that can go wrong along the way. If you regularly experience symptoms of feeling sick after eating you should consult with a doctor to ensure everything is okay. </p>
<p> 8 Common Causes Of Nausea And Illness After Eating </p>
<p> The following list represents only 8 of the many potential reasons you may be experiencing nausea or sickness after eating. </p>
<p> 1. Stomach Producing Excess Acid </p>
<p> Gastritis, or excess stomach acid, can result in nausea that may or may not include stomach pain. If taking an antacid medication makes you feel better your issue might be related to an over production of acid in your stomach. The stomach produces too much acid for a few reasons, including anxiety or a chronic bacterial infection. Most causes are treatable and not usually serious. But if issues involving excess production of stomach acid are not resolved, larger issues can arise, such as the development of a frank ulcer. </p>
<p> 2. Food Allergies </p>
<p> There are a number of food allergies you could be suffering from such as a wheat, gluten, or lactose intolerance. Food allergies can manifest randomly, or go undiagnosed for years, meaning you could have a food allergy even if you think you don’t. By consuming foods you are allergic to you are bound to feel sick. Keeping a food journal and logging how you feel after each meal is a great way to uncover culprit foods. </p>
<p> 3. Peptic Ulcer </p>
<p> A common type of ulcer that leads to stomach pain after eating is a peptic ulcer, typically caused by bacterium Helicobacter pylori invasion, or from taking painkillers over an extended period of time. Signs of a peptic ulcer include a painful burning near the epigastric region when you are hungry, and nausea when you are full. There are other types of ulcers that can form in your digestive track as well, and when these ulcers are present the process of digesting food can be very painful. </p>
<p> 4. Stress </p>
<p> Stress and anxiety are not just ‘emotions.’ The way that we feel actually impacts our physical wellbeing. The mood you are experiencing while consuming a meal will translate to how well you digest the meal. If you are feeling anxious, overly excited, or stressed while eating you can easily experience an upset stomach afterwards. </p>
<p> 5. Consuming Infrequent Meals </p>
<p> If you don’t eat enough and stretch long periods of time between each meal you risk feeling sick when you do eat. If it’s been a long time since your last meal, make sure and eat slowly to reduce your chances of feeling sick afterwards. You should also make a conscious effort to eat smaller snacks all day as opposed to one meal here and there. </p>
<p> 6. Appendicitis </p>
<p> If you are suddenly feeling nauseous after eating it might have to do with appendicitis. Visit a doctor right away if the pain is centered near the lower right portion of your stomach. An appendicitis can lead to a ruptured appendix within 24-hours if it is left untreated. </p>
<p> 7. Gallstones </p>
<p> If you notice the pain near the upper portion of your stomach, and the pain is especially bad after consuming fried foods, the cause might be gallstones. </p>
<p> 8. Stomach Cancer </p>
<p> Before you hit the panic button, stomach or gastric cancer is the most severe cause of stomach pain after eating. If cancer is the culprit you will likely experience other symptoms as well, such as weight loss and bloody stools. </p>

<doc id="file21599760" filename="Ancient_Israelite_cuisine" parent_folder="web2" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Israelite_cuisine">
<p> Religious beliefs, which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, shaped the Israelite diet. There was considerable continuity in the main components of the diet over time, despite the introduction of new foodstuffs at various stages. The food of ancient Israel was similar to that of other ancient Mediterranean diets. </p>
<p> Information about the food of the ancient Israelites is based on written sources, archaeological records and comparative evidence from the wider region of the ancient Levant. </p>
<p> The primary written source for the period is the Hebrew Bible, the largest collection of written documents surviving from ancient Israel. </p>
<p> These lists indicate the potential foods that were available, but not necessarily how regularly the food was eaten or how significant it was in the cuisine, which needs to be derived from other sources.[1][2] </p>
<p> Archaeological remains include the items used for the production of food, such as wine or olive presses, stone and metal implements used in the preparation of food, and amphorae, jars, storerooms and grain pits used for storage. </p>
<p> Animal bones provide evidence of meat consumption, the types of animals eaten, and whether they were kept for milk production or other uses, while paleobotanical remains, such as seeds or other carbonized or desiccated plant remains provide information about plant foods.[1] </p>
<p> Using both written and archaeological data, some comparisons can be drawn between the food of ancient Israel and its neighbors. </p>
<p> Although there is much information about the foods of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the inferences that can be made are limited due to differences in topography and climate; Israelite agriculture also depended on rainfall rather than the river-based irrigation of these two civilizations, resulting in the preference for different crops. </p>
<p> Ugarit and Phoenicia were closer neighbors of ancient Israel, and shared a topography and climate similar to that of ancient Israel. Thus, conclusions about the food and drink in ancient Israel have been made with some confidence from this evidence.[1][3] </p>
<p> Significant milestones in the availability and development food production characteristic of Israelite cuisine occurred well before the Israelite period. On the other hand, vestiges of the cuisine and the practices associated with it continue to resonate in later Jewish cuisine and traditions that developed in Israel and Babylonia during the Talmudic period (200 CE-500 CE), and may still be discerned in the various culinary styles that have developed among Jewish communities since then.[4] </p>
<p> During the Pottery Neolithic period (6000-4300 BCE), the development of pottery enabled people to produce portable containers for the transportation and storage of food, and an economy based on agriculture and herding developed.[7] Archaeological evidence indicates that figs, lentils and broad beans were being cultivated from Neolithic times.[8] </p>
<p> During the Chalcolithic period (4300-3300 BCE), large pottery containers, indicative of settled peoples, appear in the archaeological record. Date palm cultivation began in the Jordan River Valley, and the earliest date pits have been discovered at Ein Gedi by the Dead Sea. In the Golan, olives trees were grown and olive oil was produced there.[7] </p>
<p> Chickpea cultivation dates back to the Bronze Age (3300 – 1200 BCE)[8] and grapes and olives became important crops in the hill country. </p>
<p> Wine and oil were traded for wheat with the cities on the coastal plain, and for meat and skins with semi-nomadic herders. Wine and carobs were also exported to Egypt during this period. </p>
<p> At Arad in the northern Negev, the remains of wheat, barley and legumes have been found, along with stone-lined storage pits for grain from this period. Pottery was imported from Cyprus and Mycenae in Greece for the first time, probably for use as good-quality tableware. </p>
<p> After the Bronze Age collapse of urban culture, there was an increase in herding and the disappearance of smaller agricultural communities.[7] </p>
<p> Granaries from an Iron Age Israelite fortress in the Negev, reconstructed at Derech Hadorot, Hecht Museum, Haifa. </p>
<p> Pastoralism and animal husbandry remained important, and walled open spaces in villages that probably served as paddocks have been discovered. The construction of terraces in the hills, and of additional plastered cisterns for water storage, enabled more cultivation than before. Storage pits and silos were dug into the ground to hold grain. </p>
<p> Under the united Israelite monarchy, central store cities were built, and greater areas of the northern Negev came under cultivation. The Gezer agricultural calendar, detailing the crops that were raised, dates from this period.[7] </p>
<p> After the division of the Israelite kingdom, Jerusalem and a number of other cities expanded, supported by the surrounding villages and farms. These were called “daughters of” the major towns in the Hebrew Bible (for example, Josh 17:11 and Josh 15:47). Large food storage facilities and granaries were built, such as the city of Hazor. </p>
<p> During the later Iron Age (Iron Age II) period, roughly the same period as the Israelite and Judean monarchies, olive oil and wine were produced on a large scale for commerce and export, as well as for local consumption.[7] </p>
<p> The ancient Israelites depended on bread, wine and oil as the basic dietary staples[9] and this trio is often mentioned in the Bible (for example, Deut 7:13 and 2 Kings 18:32) and in other texts, such as the Samaria and Arad ostraca.[10] Written and archaeological evidence indicate that the diet also included other products from plants, trees and animals. </p>
<p> Seven basic agricultural products, called the Seven Species, are listed in the Bible: wheat, barley, figs, grapes, olives, pomegranates, and dates (Deut 8:8).[4] The Bible also often describes the land of Israel as a land "flowing with milk and honey" (for example, Exod 3:8).[11] </p>
<p> The cuisine maintained many consistent traits based on the main products available from the early Israelite period until the Roman period, even though new foods became available during this extended time. For example, rice was introduced during the Persian era; during the Hellenistic period, as trade with the Nabateans increased, more spices became available, at least for those who could afford them, and more Mediterranean fish were imported into the cities; and during the Roman period, sugar cane was introduced.[7] </p>
<p> The symbolic food of the ancient Israelites continued to be important among Jews after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE (AD) and the beginning of the Jewish Diaspora. Bread, wine, and olive oil were seen as direct links to the three main crops of ancient Israel—wheat, grapes, and olives. </p>
<p> In the Bible, this trio is described as representing the divine response to human needs (Hosea 2:23–24) and particularly the need for the seasonal rains vital for the successful cultivation of these three crops. (Deuteronomy 11:13–14).[12] The significance of wine, bread and oil is indicated by their incorporation into Jewish religious ritual, with the blessings over wine and bread for Shabbat and holiday meals and at religious ceremonies such as weddings, and the lighting of Shabbat and festival lights with olive oil.[4][13]:22–23[14] </p>
<p> The daily diet of the ordinary ancient Israelite was mainly one of bread, cooked grains, and legumes. Bread was eaten with every meal. Vegetables played a smaller, but significant role in the diet. </p>
<p> Legumes and vegetables were typically eaten in stews. The Israelites drank goat and sheep’s milk when it was available in the spring and summer, and ate butter and cheese. Honey, both from bees and date honey, was also eaten. </p>
<p> Figs and grapes were the fruits most commonly eaten, while dates, pomegranates, and other fruits and nuts were eaten more occasionally. Wine was the most popular beverage and sometimes other fermented beverages were produced. </p>
<p> Meat, usually goat and mutton, was eaten rarely by most Israelites and was reserved for special occasions such as celebrations, festival meals, or sacrificial feasts. The wealthy ate meat more frequently. </p>
<p> Olives were used primarily for their oil, which was used raw and to cook meat and stews. Game, birds, eggs, and fish were also eaten, depending on availability.[13]:22–24[15][16][17][18] </p>
<p> Most food was eaten fresh and in season. Fruits and vegetables had to be eaten as they ripened and before they spoiled. </p>
<p> People had to contend with periodic episodes of hunger and famine; producing enough food required hard and well-timed labor, and the climatic conditions resulted in unpredictable harvests and the need to store as much food as possible. Thus, grapes were made into raisins and wine; olives were made into oil; figs, beans, and lentils were dried; and grains were stored for use throughout the year.[9] </p>
<p> An Israelite meal is illustrated by the biblical description of the rations that Abigail brought to David’s group: bread loaves, wine, butchered sheep, parched grain, raisins, and fig cakes (1 Samuel 25:18).[3][19] </p>
<p> Durum wheat was the wheat most commonly grown in ancient Israel </p>
<p> Grain products constituted the majority of the food consumed by the ancient Israelites. The staple food was bread, and it was such a vital part of each meal that the Hebrew word for bread, lehem, also referred to food in general. The supreme importance of bread to the ancient Israelites is also demonstrated by how Biblical Hebrew has at least a dozen words for bread, and bread features in numerous Hebrew proverbs (for example, Proverbs 20:17, Proverbs 28:19).[14][20] </p>
<p> Bread was eaten at just about every meal and is estimated to have provided from 50 to 70 percent of an ordinary person’s daily calories. The bread eaten until the end of the Israelite monarchy was mainly made from barley flour; during the Second Temple period, bread from wheat flour become predominant.[12][14] </p>
<p> Porridge and gruel were made from ground grain, water, salt, and butter. This mixture also formed the basis for cakes, to which oil, called shemen, and fruits were sometimes added before baking.[21] </p>
<p> The Israelites cultivated both wheat and barley; these two grains are mentioned first in the biblical list of the Seven Species of the land of Israel and their importance as food is also seen in the celebration of the barley harvest at the festival of Shavuot and of the wheat harvest at the festival of Sukkot.[10] </p>
<p> Rice was introduced during the early Second Temple period through contact with the Persians. By the Roman period, rice had become an important export, and the Jerusalem Talmud states about rice that “there is none like it outside Israel,” and that notable rabbis served rice at the Passover seder.[7][22] </p>
<p> Barley was the grain most commonly used to make into flour for bread in Iron Age Israel. </p>
<p> Barley (hordeum vulgare) was the most important grain during the biblical period, and this was recognized ritually on the second day of Passover in the Omer offering, consisting of barley flour from the newly ripened crop. Furthermore, its significance to Israelite society, not only as a source of food, is illustrated by the biblical method for measuring a field by the amount of barley (rather than of wheat) with which it could be sown.[23] </p>
<p> Barley was initially predominant because it matured earlier and tolerated harsher conditions than wheat, growing in areas with less rainfall and poorer soils, such as northern Negev and the hill country.[10] It had high yield potential and was resistant to insect infestation. It could be sown without plowing and could therefore be grown on small plots of land that oxen or even donkeys could not reach, and it did not need artificial irrigation. </p>
<p> It ripened a month earlier than wheat and was thus available to replenish supplies used up during the winter sooner than wheat, and also provide some food security if the more vulnerable wheat crop was poor or failed.[23] </p>
<p> Two varieties of barley were cultivated: two-rowed, and six-rowed. Two-rowed barley was the older, hulled form; six-rowed barley was unhulled and easier to thresh, and, since the kernels remained intact, store for longer periods. Hulled barley was thus the prevalent type during the Iron Age, but gruels made from it must have had a gritty taste due to the barley’s tough outer layers.[23] </p>
<p> Bread was primarily made from barley flour during the Iron Age (Judges 7:13, 2 Kings 4:42), as barley was more widely and easily grown, and was thus more available, cheaper, and could be made into bread without a leavening agent[4] even though wheat flour was regarded as superior.[10] It was presumably made from dough that was a simple mixture of barley flour and water, divided into small pieces, formed by hand into round shapes, then baked.[23] </p>
<p> However, barley declined as the staple from the biblical period to a poverty food by the end of the Second Temple period, and by the Talmudic era, it was regarded mostly as animal fodder.[23] </p>
<p> Emmer wheat (triticum dicoccum) was initially the most widespread variety of wheat, as it grew well in the warm climate and was resistant to fungal rot. </p>
<p> It was high yielding, with large grains and relatively high amounts of gluten, and bread made from emmer wheat flour was thus fairly light in texture. However, emmer required time-consuming pounding or roasting to remove its husk, and during the Iron Age, durum wheat (triticum durum), a descendant of emmer, gradually replaced emmer and became the favored grain for making fine flour. </p>
<p> Durum grew well in the rich soil of the larger valleys of the central and northern areas of the country, where rainfall exceeded 225 millimeters per year, was higher yielding than emmer, and its grains released more easily from the chaff. It could therefore be separated from the husk without roasting or pounding first, thus reducing the work required for threshing, and also leaving most of the grains whole, which was better for longer storage.[10][24] </p>
<p> However, durum is a hard grain and was difficult to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued to be used for making bread until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat (triticum aestivum) replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel; this together with durum wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop by the end of the Second Temple period. </p>
<p> The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread-making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and durum wheat breads.[25] </p>
<p> A series of developments in technology for threshing, milling, and baking improved both the quantity and the quality of the grain and the means for preparation that were available from the beginning of the Iron Age until the end of the Second Temple period. </p>
<p> In the early Iron Age, grain was threshed to remove it from the stalks by beating it with sticks or by oxen treading on it. This usually broke most of the grain kernels, which limited their storage time because broken kernels spoil more quickly than unbroken ones. The development of the threshing-board, which was pulled over the stalks by oxen, left most of the grain kernels intact and enhanced their storage time. Numerous threshing floors and threshing boards have been discovered at archaeological sites of ancient Israel.[6] </p>
<p> Once separated from the stalks, the grain was used in a number of ways: Most simply, unripe kernels of grain were eaten fresh, particularly in the spring, before ripe grain was available, and both unripe and ripe grain was roasted over fire for immediate use. </p>
<p> Ripe grains of wheat were also parboiled and dried, like modern bulgur, and then prepared as porridge. Whole or cracked grain was also used in stews and to make gruel. Most frequently, grains were ground into flour to prepare bread.[4][20] </p>
<p> Bread was the main source of nourishment in biblical times, and making bread was a daily activity:[14] </p>
<p> An upper hand stone was used to grind grain on the lower quern stone. </p>
<p> Bread-making began with the milling of the grain. It was a difficult and time-consuming task performed by women. Each household stored its own grain, and it is estimated that it required at least three hours of daily effort to produce enough flour to make sufficient bread for a family of five. </p>
<p> The earliest milling was performed with a pestle and mortar, or a stone quern consisting of a large lower stone that held the grain and a smooth upper stone that was moved back and forth over the grains (Numbers 11:8). This often left small pieces of grit in the flour. </p>
<p> The use of the millstone became more widespread during the Iron Age, resulting in greater speed and increased production of flour. Smaller versions for household use, the rotary or beehive quern, appeared during the early Persian period.[10][14] </p>
<p> After the grain was milled into flour, it was mixed with water and kneaded in a large trough. For dough made with wheat flour, starter, called seor, was added. The starter was prepared by reserving a small portion of dough from a previous batch to absorb the yeasts in the air and thus help leaven the new dough. Seor thus gave the bread a sourdough flavor.[14] </p>
<p> Once prepared, the dough could be baked in various ways: </p>
<p> Originally, the dough was placed directly on the heated stones of a cooking fire or in a griddle or pan made of clay or iron (Leviticus 7:9). </p>
<p> In the time of the First Temple, two types of oven were used for baking bread: the jar-oven, and the pit-oven. The jar-oven was a large pottery container, narrowing into an opening toward the top; fuel was burned on the inside to heat it and the dough was pressed against the outside to bake. </p>
<p> The pit-oven was a clay-lined excavation in the ground in which the fuel was burned and then pushed aside before the loaves were baked on the heated surface. </p>
<p> People also began placing a convex dome, initially earthenware and later metal, over the pit-oven and cooking the flatbreads on the dome instead of on the ash-covered surface; this type of oven is probably what was meant by the biblical machabat, often translated as "griddle".[14] </p>
<p> The Persians introduced a clay oven called a tanur (similar to the Indian tandoor), which had an opening at the bottom for the fire, and through which the bread was placed to be baked on the inner wall of the upper chamber from the heat of the oven and ashes after the flames had died down. This continued to be the way in which Yemenite Jews baked bread until modern times. </p>
<p> The remains of clay ovens and fragments of bread trays have been found in several archaeological excavations.[4][20] </p>
<p> All these methods produced only thin loaves, and the custom was thus to break bread rather than cut it. The bread was soft and pliable and used for dipping and sopping up gravies and juices.[4][20] </p>
<p> The Romans introduced an oven called a furn (purni in Talmudic Aramaic), a large, wood-burning, stone-lined oven with a bottom on which the dough or baking sheet was placed. This provided a major advance in bread and pastry baking, and made the baking of much thicker loaves possible.[14] </p>
<p> A variety of breads were produced. Probably most common were unleavened flat loaves called ugah or kikkar.[10] Another type was a thin wafer, known as a rakik. A thicker loaf, known as hallah, was made with the best-quality flour, usually for ritual purposes.[4][14] </p>
<p> Bread was sometimes enriched by the addition of flour from legumes (Ezekiel 4:9). The Mishna (Hallah 2:2) mentions bread dough made with fruit juice instead of water. The sugar in the juice, interacting with the flour and water, provided some leavening and sweetened the bread.[2] </p>
<p> The Israelites also sometimes added fennel and cumin to bread dough for flavor and dipped their bread in vinegar (Ruth 2:14), olive oil, or sesame oil for extra flavor.[4] </p>
<p> Broad beans, chickpeas, and lentils are the only legumes mentioned in the Bible but lentils, broad beans, chickpeas, fenugreek, field peas and bitter vetch have been found at Iron Age Israelite sites. By the Roman period, legumes are mentioned frequently in other texts. They are cited as one of the elements of the “wife’s food basket” in the Mishna (Ketubot 5:8), by which it is estimated that legumes supplied 17% of daily calories at that time.[26] </p>
<p> Lentils were the most important of the legumes and were used to make pottages and soups, as well as fried lentil cakes called ashishim (similar to Arabic felafel), such as those that King David is described as distributing to the people when the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem.[27]According to Tova Dickstein, a researcher at Neot Kedumim in Israel, ashishim were honey-dipped pancakes made from crushed red lentils and sesame seeds.[28] </p>
<p> Stews made of lentils or beans were common and they were cooked with onion, garlic, and leeks for flavor. Fresh legumes were also roasted, or dried and stored for extended periods. They were then cooked in a soup or a stew. The Bible mentions roasted legumes (2 Samuel 17:28), and relates how Jacob prepared bread and a pottage of lentils for Esau (Genesis 25:29–34).[15][26] </p>
<p> Vegetables are not found often in the archaeological record, and it is difficult to determine the role that they played, because plant foods were often eaten raw or were simply boiled, without requiring special equipment for preparation, and thus barely leaving any trace other than the type of food itself.[29] </p>
<p> Vegetables also are not mentioned often in the written record, and when the Bible does mention them, the attitude is mixed: sometimes they are regarded as a delicacy, but more often, they were held in low esteem (for example, (Proverbs 15:17, Daniel 1:11–15).[26][30] </p>
<p> Vegetables were perhaps a more important food at the extremes in society: the wealthy who could afford to dedicate land and resources to grow them, and the poor who depended on gathering them in the wild to supplement their meager supplies. More people may have gathered wild plants during famine conditions.[26] </p>
<p> Vegetables that were commonly eaten included leeks, garlic, onions, black radishes, net or muskmelons (sometimes misidentified as the cucumber) and watermelons.[31] Other vegetables played a minor role in the diet of the ancient Israelites. </p>
<p> Field greens and root plants were generally not cultivated and were gathered seasonally when they grew in the wild.[30] Leafy plants included dandelion greens and the young leaves of the orach plant.[21][30] </p>
<p> Leeks, onions, and garlic were eaten cooked in stews, and uncooked with bread, and their popularity may be indicated by the observation in the Bible that they are among the foods that the Israelites yearned for after leaving Egypt.[21][32] </p>
<p> Gourds and melons were eaten raw or flavored with vinegar. Black radishes were also eaten raw when in season during the autumn and winter. The Talmud mentions the use of radish seeds to produce oil and considered eating radishes to have health benefits.[32] </p>
<p> Wild lettuce, known as chazeret, was a leafy herb with prickly, red tinged leaves that became bitter as they matured. It was cultivated from around 800 BC. Sweeter head-lettuce was only developed and introduced by the Romans. </p>
<p> Bitter herbs eaten at the Passover sacrifice with the unleavened bread, matza, were known as merorim. Chazeret is listed in the Mishna (Pesahim 2:6) as the preferred bitter herb for this Passover ritual, along with other bitter herbs, including chicory or endive (ulshin), horehound (tamcha), reichardia or eryngo (charchavina), and wormwood (maror).[31][34] </p>
<p> Mushrooms, especially of the Boletus type, were gathered in many areas, particularly when plentiful after a major rainfall. The Talmud mentions mushrooms in connection with their exemption from tithes and as a dessert at the Passover seder.[35] </p>
<p> Sesame seeds were used in the preparation of oil, were eaten dry, or were added to dishes such as stews as a flavoring; the leftovers after pressing out the oil were eaten in a cake form.[36] The Hebrew for sesame, shumshum, is related to the Akkadian samassammu, meaning "oil plant", as the seeds contain about 50% oil, which was pressed from the seeds. </p>
<p> Sesame is not mentioned in the Bible, but the Mishna lists sesame oil as suitable for lighting the Sabbath lights, and the oil was also used for frying.[37] </p>
<p> Fruit was an important source of food for the Israelites, particularly grapes, olives, and figs. Grapes were grown mostly for wine, although some were eaten fresh at harvest time, or dried as raisins for storage, while olives were grown exclusively for their oil, until the Roman period. Other fruits that were eaten were the date, pomegranate, and sycamore fig.[38][39] </p>
<p> The ancient Israelites built terraces of leveled areas in the hill country for planting a variety of crops, including grains, vegetables, and fruit trees.[40] All the trees, with the exception of the olive, produced fruit that could be eaten fresh or juiced while in season. Fruit was also processed for later use in a variety of ways: fruit with high sugar content was fermented to make alcoholic beverages; grapes were most commonly used for this. </p>
<p> Fruit was also boiled down into thick, sweet syrup, referred to in the Bible as dvash (honey). Grapes, figs, dates, and apricots were also dried and preserved individually, put on a string, or pressed into cakes. Since dried fruit is an efficient source of energy, such were prepared as provisions for journeys and long marches.[38][41] </p>
<p> The olive is one of the biblical Seven Species and one of the three elements of the "Mediterranean triad" in Israelite cuisine. Olive oil was used not only as food and for cooking, but also for lighting, sacrificial offerings, ointment, and anointment for priestly or royal office.[42] </p>
<p> Olives were one of ancient Israel’s most important natural resources </p>
<p> The olive tree was well suited to the climate and soil of the Israelite highlands, and a significant part of the hill country was allocated to the cultivation of olive trees, which were one of ancient Israel’s most important natural resources.[38] Olive oil was more versatile and longer-lasting than the oil from other plants, such as sesame, and was also considered to be the best-tasting.[30] </p>
<p> Although olives were used to produce oil from the Bronze Age, it was only by the Roman period that the techniques were introduced to cure olives in lye and then brine to remove their natural bitterness and make them edible.[43][44] </p>
<p> Olives were harvested in the late summer and were processed for oil by crushing them, pressing the mash, and separating the oil from the flesh. In the early Iron Age period, this was done by treading the olives in basins cut into rock, or with a mortar or stone on a flat slab. In the later Iron Age period, the introduction of the beam press made large scale processing possible.[42] </p>
<p> The discovery of many ancient olive presses in various locations indicates that olive-oil production was highly developed in ancient Israel. The oil production center dating from the 7th century BC discovered at Ekron, a Philistine city, has over one hundred large olive presses and is the most complete olive oil production center from ancient times yet discovered. It indicates that ancient Israel was a major producer of olive oil for its residents and other parts of the ancient Near East, such as Egypt, and especially Mesopotamia.[30][42] </p>
<p> In addition to the large-scale olive oil production for commerce and export, presses have been found in ordinary houses, indicating that this was also a cottage industry.[7] </p>
<p> Archaeological remains at Masada and other sites indicate that the most common olive cultivar was the indigenous Nabali, followed by the Souri. In Roman times, other olive cultivars were imported from Syria and Egypt.[44] </p>
<p> There is also some written information about olive oil. The Bible describes its use in relation to certain sacrifices in which olive oil is used (for example, (Leviticus 6:13–14, Leviticus 7:9–12). However, these sacrificial "recipes" can be assumed to represent some of the everyday uses of oil and methods for cooking and frying.[30] Olive oil was mixed with flour to make bread in the story of Elijah and the widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 17:12–13) and is also noted as a valuable product for eating (Ezekiel 16:13,19). Olive oil is also mentioned on the Samaria and Arad ostraca.[42] </p>
<p> The consumption of olive oil varied with social class: it was less available to the poor, but it may have become more available later in the Israelite period as the means of production improved and became more widespread. </p>
<p> By early Roman times, the Mishna indicates that it was one of the four essential foods that a husband had to provide his wife, and it has been calculated that at a minimum, this represented about 11 percent of the overall calories supplied by the "food basket" described at that time.[42] </p>
<p> Grapes are another of the biblical Seven Species and were used mainly for the production of wine, although they were also eaten fresh and dried. Grapes were dried in the sun to produce raisins, which could then be stored for a long time. Raisins were also pressed into clusters and dried as cakes, which kept the interior raisins softer.[38][45] </p>
<p> Grapes were also used to produce a thick, honey-like liquid, called grape honey (dvash anavim), that was used as a sweetener. Grape honey was made by treading the grapes in vats, but instead of fermenting the liquid produced, it was boiled to evaporate its water, leaving behind the thick, grape syrup.[36] </p>
<p> Dried figs were a significant source of winter food </p>
<p> Figs were an important source of food. Figs were cultivated throughout the land of Israel, and fresh or dried figs were part of the daily diet. A common way of preparing dried figs was to chop them and press them into a cake.[46] </p>
<p> Figs are one of the biblical Seven Species and are frequently mentioned in the Bible (for example, 1 Samuel 25:18, 1 Samuel 30:12 and 1 Chronicles 12:41).[38] The remains of dried figs have been discovered from as early as the Neolithic period in Gezer, Israel[46] and Gilgal in the Jordan Valley.[47] </p>
<p> The fig tree (ficus carica) grew well in the hill country and produced two crops a season. Early-ripening figs were regarded as delicacy because of their sweetness and were eaten fresh. Figs ripening in the later harvest were often dried and strung into a chain, or pressed into hard round or square-shaped cakes called develah and stored as a major source of winter food. The blocks of dried fig were sliced and eaten like bread.[21][39] </p>
<p> The Mishna mentions figs as one of the components of the prescribed "wife’s food basket" and they are estimated to have constituted 16% of the overall calories of the basket.[38] </p>
<p> Dates were eaten fresh or dried, but were mostly boiled into thick, long-lasting syrup called "date honey" (dvash temarim) for use as a sweetener. This syrup was prepared by soaking the dates in water for some time until they disintegrated and then boiling the resulting liquid down into thick syrup. The honey in the Biblical reference of "a land flowing with milk and honey" is probably date honey.[39][48] </p>
<p> Fresh, ripe dates were available from mid to late summer. Some were sun-dried and pressed into blocks to dry completely and then used throughout the year, especially as food for travelers. Dates were also fermented into one of the "strong drinks" referred to in the Bible as "shechar".[48] </p>
<p> The date palm required a hot and dry climate and mostly grew and produced fruit in the Jordan Rift Valley from Jericho to the Sea of Galilee.[38] In these arid areas, the date was sometimes the only plant-food available and was a primary component of the diet, but it was less important elsewhere.[48] </p>
<p> Pomegranates were usually eaten fresh, although occasionally they were used to make juice or wine, or sun-dried for use when the fresh fruit was out of season. They probably played a minor part in Israelite cuisine but were symbolically important as adornments on the hem of the robe of the high priest and the Temple pillars and embossed on coinage; they are also listed in the Bible as one of the Seven Species of the Land of Israel.[38][49] </p>
<p> The sycamore fig, carob, mulberry, and possibly the apple were also eaten.[39] Usually, these fruits were not cultivated but were picked in the wild when they were in season.[36] </p>
<p> The sycamore fig (Ficus sycamorus) was very common in the warmer parts of Israel and was grown primarily for its wood, but it provided a steady supply of small figs, eaten mainly by the poor.[38] </p>
<p> Other native trees producing fruits included the carob, which was probably popular due to its sweet taste, and the black mulberry.[41] </p>
<p> The tapuah, which means "apple" in modern Hebrew, is mentioned in the Bible, but it is not clear if this referred to another fruit, such as the apricot[50] or quince.[51] </p>
<p> Almonds, walnuts, and pistachios were eaten and are mentioned in the Bible. Almonds were widespread in the region from prehistoric times, and the Bible mentions almonds (shaked) and pistachios (botnim) as among the "choice fruits of the land" sent by Jacob as a gift to the ruler of Egypt (Genesis 43:11). </p>
<p> Almonds and pistachios were probably eaten primarily by the wealthy. The walnut reached Israel from Mesopotamia by at least 2000 BCE and is mentioned once in the Bible (Song of Solomon 6:11). Walnuts became common during the Second Temple period and so widespread that the word for walnut, egoz, became the generic Hebrew word for nut at that time.[38][52] </p>
<p> The Israelites usually drank water drawn from wells, cisterns, or rivers. They also drank milk (for example, as mentioned in the Bible in Judges 5:25), often in the form of sour milk, thin yogurt, or whey, when it was available in the spring and summer. They drank fresh juices from fruits in season as well.[41] </p>
<p> The most strongly preferred beverage was wine, although some beer may have also been produced,[53] and wine was an important part of the diet and a source of calories, sugar, and iron.[12] Making wine was also a practical way to preserve fruit juices for long-term storage. Usually, wine was made from grapes for everyday use, as well as for rituals, such as sacrificial libations. Less often, wine was made from pomegranates and dates.[41] </p>
<p> The Mediterranean climate and soil of the mountainous areas of the area are well suited to viticulture, and both archaeological evidence and written records indicate the significant cultivation of grapes in ancient Israel and the popularity of wine-drinking. </p>
<p> The production capacity apparent from archaeological remains and the frequent biblical references to wine suggest that it was the principal alcoholic beverage of the ancient Israelites. Based on the remains of wine production facilities and storage rooms, it has been estimated that on average, people could have consumed one liter of wine per person per day.[54] </p>
<p> Many rock-hewn winepresses and vats, dating to the biblical period, have been found. One typical example at Gibeon has a wide surface for treading the grapes and a series of collecting vats. Archaeological finds at Ashkelon and Gibeon indicate large-scale wine production in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, which most likely developed to supply the Assyrian empire, and then the Babylonians, as well as the local population. </p>
<p> Vineyards are mentioned many times in the Bible, including in detailed descriptions of the method for establishing a vineyard (Isaiah 5:1–2) and the types of vines (Ezekiel 17:6–8).[54][55] The Bible refers to several types of wine, and one of the Arad ostraca also mentions wine among the supplies being sent to a garrison of soldiers.[7] </p>
<p> Another indication of the importance of wine in ancient Israel is that Hebrew contains numerous terms for various stages and types of vines, grape varieties, and words for wine. The word yayin was used both as a generic word for wine and as a term for wine in its first year, once it had undergone sufficient fermentation from the initial stage, when it was called tirosh.[55] The type of wine was determined by the grapes, the time allowed for fermentation, and the age of the wine.[36] </p>
<p> The often coarse and unrefined taste of ancient wine was adjusted to make it more drinkable. Spices were added directly to the wine to improve the aroma, and other ingredients, such as honey, pepper, herbs, and even lime, resin, or seawater were added to improve the flavor or disguise a poor-tasting wine. Wine was also sweetened by the addition of grape juice syrup.[56] Wine was also sometimes given an aroma by rubbing the winepress with wood resin.[36] </p>
<p> Wine could also be added to drinking water to improve the taste, especially towards the end of the summer when rainwater had been standing in a cistern for at least six months. This also had the beneficial effect of lowering the bacterial content of the water.[12] </p>
<p> Grapes were important for the production of wine in ancient Israel </p>
<p> After the grape harvest in mid-summer, most grapes were taken to wine presses to extract their juice for winemaking. Once fermented, wine was transferred to wineskins or large amphorae for storage. </p>
<p> Israelite amphorae were typically tall with large handles and little decoration, and the handles were often inscribed with the name of the city in which the wine had been produced, the winemaker’s stamp, and sometimes the year and the vintage. </p>
<p> Amphorae made long term storage possible, especially in caves or cool cellars. Glass bottles were introduced only in the 1st century AD by the Romans.[55] </p>
<p> The insides of amphorae were often coated with a preservative resin, such as from the terebinth, and this imparted a pine flavor and aroma to the wine. Before the jars were sealed with pitch, they were filled completely and often topped with a thin layer of olive oil to prevent spoilage due to exposure to air.[55] </p>
<p> During the Greek period, the style of winemaking changed. Ripe grapes were first dried to concentrate the sugars, and these then produced a much sweeter and higher alcohol content wine that needed to be diluted with water to be drinkable. Before this, watered-down wine was disparaged, but by the time of the Talmud, wine that did not require dilution with water was considered unfit for consumption.[55] </p>
<p> Beer, produced by brewing barley, was another alcoholic beverage common in the ancient Near East. Beer was the primary beverage of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia and it can be assumed that in Israel, which is located between the two, beer was also known. The biblical term sekhar may refer to beer or to alcoholic drinks in general.[54][57] </p>
<p> The production of bread and beer were closely linked, since barley was the same key ingredient used for both, and most of the tools used in beer production, such as mortars, querns and winnowing baskets were also the same as for bread making. Archaeological evidence specific to beer making is thus uncommon, and earlier indications were that the ancient Israelites did not often drink beer. </p>
<p> More recently, Iron-Age sites in Israel have produced remains such as beer jugs, bottles, strainers and stoppers, all of which provide evidence that the Israelites drank beer.[57] Nonetheless, the widespread cultivation of grapes, used primarily for winemaking, indicates that wine drinking was probably far more common than beer drinking.[10] </p>
<p> The Israelites usually ate meat from domesticated goats and sheep. Goat’s meat was the most common. Fat-tailed sheep were the predominant variety of sheep in ancient Israel, but, as sheep were valued more than goats, they were eaten less often. The fat of the tail was considered a delicacy.[58] </p>
<p> Beef and venison were eaten primarily by the elites, and fattened calves provided veal for the wealthy (for example, as mentioned in the Bible, Amos 6:4).[59] </p>
<p> For most people, meat was eaten only a few times a year when animals were slaughtered for the major festivals, or at tribal meetings, celebrations such as weddings, and for the visits of important guests (1 Samuel 28:24). Only at the king's table was meat served daily, according to the Bible.[21] </p>
<p> Although most meat was obtained from domesticated animals, meat from hunted animals was also sometimes available, as the story of Isaac and Esau (Genesis 27:3–4), certain Biblical lists (for example, Deuteronomy 14:5), and archaeological evidence indicate. The remains of gazelle, red deer, and fallow deer are the most commonly found in the archaeological record. </p>
<p> Archaeological evidence from an Iron-Age market excavated at Ashkelon shows that game was also sold to those who could not hunt or trap them themselves.[60] However, meat from wild animals was more common at times of economic distress and in the northern areas, where forests and open land provided a habitat for more wild animals.[61] </p>
<p> Meat was prepared in several different ways. The most common was to cook it with water as a broth or a stew (for example, Ezekiel 24:4–5). Meat stewed with onions, garlic, and leeks and flavored with cumin and coriander is described on ancient Babylonian cuneiform tablets, and it is most likely that it was prepared similarly in ancient Israel. Stewed meat was considered to be a dish worthy of serving to honored guests (Judges 6:19–20). </p>
<p> A less common way to prepare meat was to roast it over an open fire, but this was done particularly for the meat of the Passover lamb. For long-term storage, meat was smoked, dried, or salted, according to indications in texts and ethnographic studies.[60][61] </p>
<p> The Israelites ate domesticated birds such as pigeons, turtledoves, ducks, and geese, and wild birds such as quail, and partridge. Remains from archaeological excavations at the Ophel in Jerusalem and other Iron-Age sites show that domestic birds were available, but consumption was small. The inclusion of pigeons and turtledoves in the Biblical sacrifice lists implies that they were raised domestically, and the remains of dovecotes discovered from the Greek and Roman periods confirm this. Biblical references and archaeological evidence also demonstrate that wild birds were hunted and eaten.[62][63] </p>
<p> The turtledove was present from about April to October, while the rock pigeon was available throughout the year. The pigeon appears to have been domesticated in Sumeria and Canaan during the second millennium BC, and remained the predominant fowl in ancient Israel until the end of the Second Temple period. Nonetheless, to avoid the spread of disease, pigeons could only be raised in small numbers and were thus fairly costly and not a regular part of the diet.[64] </p>
<p> Geese, originally domesticated in ancient Egypt, were raised in ancient Israel. They are most likely the "fattened fowl" on King Solomon’s table (1 Kings 5:3). Goose breeding is also discussed in the Mishna.[64] Like other animals, birds were fattened for consumption on special occasions, and for the wealthy.[63] </p>
<p> It is unclear when chicken became part of the diet. There are some archaeological remains from Iron-Age sites, but these were likely from roosters as a fighting bird, which are also pictured on seals from the period as a symbol of ferocity, such as on the 6th-century BC onyx seal of Jaazaniah.[62][65] </p>
<p> Chicken became common around the 2nd century BC, and during the Roman period, chickens emerged as an important feature of the cuisine, with the Talmud describing it as "the choicest of birds."[66] By Roman times, pigeons and chickens were the principal poultry.[64] </p>
<p> Until the domestication of the chicken, eggs were available in limited quantities and were considered a delicacy, as in ancient Egypt.[67] The most common birds—turtledoves and pigeons—were reared for their meat and not for their very small eggs. </p>
<p> Biblical references to eggs are only in reference to gathering them from the wild (for example, Deuteronomy 22:6–7 and Isaiah 10:14).[63][64] Eggs seem to have increased in use for food only with the introduction of chickens as food and were commonly used as food by Roman times.[68] </p>
<p> The Israelites ate a variety of fresh and saltwater fish, according to both archaeological and textual evidence.[69] Remains of freshwater fish from the Yarkon and Jordan rivers and the Sea of Galilee have been found in excavations, and include St. Peter’s fish and mouthbreeders. Saltwater fish discovered in excavations include sea bream, grouper, meager, and gray mullet. Most of these come from the Mediterranean Sea, but in the later Iron Age period, some are from the Red Sea.[70] Although the Torah prohibits the consumption of fish without fins or scales, archeological evidence indicates that many Israelites flouted or were unaware of these restrictions and ate non-kosher seafood, mostly catfish but also shark, eel, and ray, and that religious restrictions on seafood began to be observed more strictly starting in the first century CE.[71][72] </p>
<p> Fishermen supplied fish to inland communities, as remains of fish, including bones and scales, have been discovered at many inland sites. To preserve them for transport, the fish were first smoked or dried and salted.[69] </p>
<p> Merchants also imported fish, sometimes from as far as from Egypt, where pickled roe was an export article.[21] Remains of Nile Perch from Egypt have been found, and these must have been smoked or dried before being imported through the trade network that connected ancient Near Eastern societies.[70] Merchants shipped fish to Jerusalem, and there was evidently a significant trade in fish; one of the gates of Jerusalem was called the Fish Gate, named for a fish market nearby (Zephaniah 1:10, Nehemiah 3:3, Nehemiah 12:39, Nehemiah 13:16, 2 Chronicles 33:14).[69][70][73] </p>
<p> It is unclear to what extent fish played a role in the cuisine, but it is apparent that fish became steadily more available during the Israelite and Judean monarchies. </p>
<p> Fish products were salted and dried and sent great distances. However, even in the later Persian, Greek, and Roman periods, the cost of preserving and transporting fish must have meant that only wealthier inhabitants of the highland towns and cities could afford it, or those who lived close to the sources, where it was less expensive.[70] In the Galilee, small-scale fishing was a fundamental component of the agrarian economy.[74] </p>
<p> Goats, and, to a lesser extent, sheep, provided milk for part of the year, and milk and dairy products were a significant source of food. Dairy products are mentioned in the Bible (for example, Genesis 18:8, Judges 4:19, and 2 Samuel 17:29, and a repeated description of the Land of Israel in the Bible is "a land flowing with milk and honey" (for example, Exodus 3:8, Exodus 33:3, and Joel 4:18)).[75][76] </p>
<p> Fresh milk could not be stored for long without spoiling. Typically, thick sour milk called laban was drunk because the Israelites stored the milk in skin containers, in which it curdled quickly.[21][76][77] </p>
<p> Milk had to be processed to preserve it. This was done by first churning it, using a goatskin or clay container to separate the butterfat from the whey. The butterfat was processed by boiling and then cooling it to make clarified butter, which could then be stored for a long time.[75][78] Clarified butter was used principally for cooking and frying. Butter churns have been excavated at Beersheba, dating from the 4th century BC, and other ancient Israelite sites.[36][76] </p>
<p> Goat milk and sheep’s milk cheeses were the most prevalent types of cheese. Soft cheese was made using cloth bags filled with soured milk. The thin liquid was drained through the cloth until a soft cheese remained in the bag. </p>
<p> A hard cheese was made from fermented soured milk: milk was poured into special moulds in which it curdled and was then hardened by drying in the sun or by heating numerous, small, cheese molds with holes for draining the whey. </p>
<p> Cheese is not mentioned often in the Bible, but in one case, David is sent to take a gift of cheese to the commander of the army (1 Samuel 17:18).[36][76][79] </p>
<p> The Mishna and Talmud mention using the sap of fruit trees, such as figs, to harden cheese (a method still used by nomadic herders of the region until modern times). Using fig sap instead of animal enzymes to make cheese also conformed to the prohibition on mixing meat and milk.[2] </p>
<p> Fruit syrup called dvash served as the primary sweetener and was most often made from dates. It was not until Talmudic times that the word "dvash" now translated as "honey", generally meant bee honey. The Biblical term dvash usually did not mean bee honey, but thick syrup obtained from grapes, figs, or dates. This syrup was similar to the date syrup, or halek, that many Jews continue to use in modern times.[76][80][81] </p>
<p> The Biblical references to "honey from the crag" (Deuteronomy 32:13) or "honey from the rock" (Psalms 81:17) could refer either to fig honey, as fig trees commonly grew in rocky outcrops, or to honey collected from wild bees, which made their nests in these places, as they still do in the region until today. </p>
<p> The Bible refers to honey from bees in only a few instances, for example, when Samson eats honey which bees made in the carcass of a lion (Judges 14:8–9) and when Jonathan eats honey from a honeycomb (1 Samuel 14:25–27), and these references are to honey obtained from the wild.[76] </p>
<p> Nonetheless, the oldest archaeological find relating to beekeeping discovered to date is an apiary dating from about 900 BC at Rehov, a Bronze-Age and Iron-Age site in the Jordan Valley. The hives, made of straw and unbaked clay, could have housed more than a million bees, and indicate that honey was produced on a large scale.[82] It is most likely that the inhabitants of Tel Rehov imported the bees from Anatolia, because they were less aggressive than the local bees and produced a higher yield of honey.[83] </p>
<p> It is also possible that the domestication of bees for honey production was introduced from Egypt during the Iron Age, and honey was being obtained from domesticated bees from late in the Iron Age period.[76][84] </p>
<p> The most common and important seasoning was salt (Job 6:6), demonstrated by how it is referenced throughout the Bible, and by how its use was mandated with most sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13). </p>
<p> Salt was obtained from the Mediterranean or the Dead Sea. It was produced by evaporating seawater from both natural and artificially created drying pans along the Mediterranean coast. It was also obtained by mining salt deposits, such as at Sodom near the Dead Sea. Salt had to be transported to other locations, so most communities had to purchase it.[21][36][84][85] </p>
<p> Some seasonings were imported, such as myrrh, galbanum, saffron, and cinnamon, but their high cost limited their widespread use. Spices for special feasts were imported by the wealthy and royalty from Arabia and India and were highly valued. These included various types of pepper, and ginger.[21][36][85] </p>
<p> Another seasoning was vinegar, which was produced by extra fermentation of new wine. It was used for seasoning foods, pickling vegetables, and medicinal purposes.[36][86] </p>
<p> Storing water and food was critical for survival, and particularly, being able to store enough food for use from one harvest to the next. To protect grain from damp and vermin, underground granaries were used for the bulk storage of grain. Families also stored grain, wine and oil in large pottery jars in their houses. When well protected, wheat, barley, legumes and nuts could be kept for long periods. Rainwater from roofs and courtyards was collected in cisterns to supplement natural sources like springs and wells.[87][88] </p>
<p> Fermentation, oil extraction and drying were all ways of converting food into products that could be stored. Feeding crops to animals was also a means of "storage on the hoof" with the animals converting the fodder into meat or milk.[87][88] </p>
<p> Food was cooked in pots made of clay and placed on earthenware stands built in a horseshoe shape, so that the fire could be lit through the opening, under the pot, or pots were suspended above the fire from tripods.[8] </p>
<p> Cooked food included soups and stews that were a mixture of meat and vegetables. Beans and lentils were likely to have been cooked several times a week. However, vegetables, such as melons, garlic, leek and onions were also eaten uncooked.[36] </p>
<p> Meals eaten by the Israelites fell into two categories: daily meals, and festive or ritual meals. </p>
<p> Daily meals were prepared by women. Two daily meals were usually eaten by the family, either in the home or in the field. The first meal was eaten in the late morning, as a break in the workday, and could include roasted grain, olives, figs or some other fruit, bread dipped in olive oil or vinegar, or bread eaten with garlic, onions, or black radishes for flavor, and water or wine.[89] A description in the Book of Ruth provides an example of this kind of meal: the harvest workers eat bread dipped in vinegar and parched or roasted grain (Ruth 2:14). Agricultural workers, who comprised the largest part of the population, also ate a light meal in the early morning before leaving for their work in the fields (Proverbs 31:15).[2][90] </p>
<p> The second meal was the main meal of the day and was eaten in the evening. In addition to bread, it typically included soup or a stew of vegetables or legumes, served in a common pot into which everyone dipped their bread. Also served from time to time were cheese and fruits such as fresh figs and melon when in season, as well as dried fruits. Water, wine, and milk could also accompany the meal.[2][89][91][92] </p>
<p> Small bowls were used for both eating and drinking. Small jugs contained condiments like olive oil, vinegar, and sweeteners. Wide-mouthed pitchers held water and milk, while spouted decanters with narrow, ridged necks with built-in strainers held wine.[92] </p>
<p> Festive meals were held to mark significant occasions, entertain important guests, or as sacrificial or ritual meals. The meal was prepared by both men and women. Meat was always served at these meals and many people participated so that there would be no leftovers that would go to waste. </p>
<p> Ritual feasts and banquets in ancient Israel, and the ancient Near East in general, were important for building social relationships and demonstrating status, transacting business and concluding agreements, enlisting divine help, or showing thanks, devotion or propitiation to a deity, and for conveying social instruction. These meals were imbued with significance by the occasion and were a time for entertainment and enjoyment.[36][93] </p>

<p> Festive meals were held only from time to time, but they are the ones recorded by biblical and extra-biblical sources. Many biblical stories are set within the context of a meal, such as the accounts of the food Abraham prepares for his visitors (Genesis 18:1–8), the stew which Jacob prepares for his father, Isaac, and the Passover meal (Exodus 12).[93][94] </p>
<p> In the story of Abraham hosting the three visitors, Abraham offers cakes, a well prepared young calf, curds, and milk. This meal has similar elements to an earlier meal described in the story of Sinuhe, an Egyptian nobleman who lived for a time in Canaan around 1900 BCE, at which bread, wine, cooked meat, roast fowl, and dairy products were served.[91] </p>
<p> One of the distinguishing features of the meals of the wealthier social class, as illustrated in the stories of Abraham and Sinuhe, was the more frequent consumption of meat. A description of the provisions for Solomon's kitchen also illustrates this: "Solomon's daily provisions consisted of 30 kor of fine flour and 60 kor of flour, 10 fat oxen, 20 pasture-fed oxen, and 100 sheep and goats, in addition to deer and gazelles, roebucks and fattened geese" (1 Kings 5:2–3). This account describes the provisions that were possible to obtain for those with the resources to purchase them and indicates they were sufficient to provide sumptuous meals for thousands of people.[89][91] </p>
<p> In contrast to the simplicity of the daily fare of ordinary people, the cuisine of the royal courts of the ancient Near East was sophisticated, and it is assumed that the dishes served at the table of King Solomon and other Israelite kings were also elaborate. King David had officials who were in charge of wine cellars, olive stores, cattle, olive and fig trees (1 Chronicles 27:27–31) and the royal kitchen was a complex organization.[15] </p>
<p> The kings of Israel are recorded as having displayed an extraordinary measure of royal hospitality, like other kings of the ancient Near East who held elaborate banquets. Solomon’s royal table is described as providing such a variety of foods that the Queen of Sheba is said to have been amazed that the reports of Solomon’s wealth did not exceed what she had seen (1 Kings 10:4–7). Royal entertainment in Israel included music (Ecclesiastes 2:8), large numbers of guests (1 Kings 18:19), and presumably many servers and cupbearers, though these are not expressly mentioned in the Bible.[3] </p>
<p> Feasts and banquets were important social and political tools throughout Israel’s history, especially in the early years of the Israelite monarchy, when an invitation to the king’s table was important for creating and maintaining political support and was also an important marker of social status and influence.[93] </p>
<p> Regular meals too, developed as expressions of common identity, social unity and communal celebration. By the Roman period, Jewish communities came together at banquets for both food and company and the weekly Sabbath meal was an occasion for families to gather and enjoy both food and company.[93] </p>
<p> The practice of hospitality was a fundamental custom of Israelite society and serving food was integral to the hosting of guests. Additionally, in ancient Israel, the belief that God had delivered Israel from slavery resulted in the social imperative and religious commandment to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude.[3] </p>
<p> The importance of hospitality to the Israelites can be inferred from the texts of the Bible, in numerous instances, including the stories of Abraham hosting the messengers, Gideon’s call to leadership (Judges 6:19), the hospitality of the woman from Zarephath towards the Prophet Elijah (1 Kings 17:8–16) and the Shunammite woman towards Elisha (2 Kings 4:8–11), David’s hosting of Mephiboshet, son of Jonathan (2 Samuel 9:6–7) and Hezekiah’s invitation to the people of the northern kingdom of Israel to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 30).[94] </p>
<p> Meals at which important guests were present were viewed as special occasions, and as such, meat was served. The order in which the guests were served indicated the recognition of the social status of the guest. The choice of meat and dishes indicated the importance of the occasion. The Bible illustrates this in relating how Samuel hosted Saul, who, seated at the head of the hall is served first with a portion of meat that has been especially reserved for him (1 Samuel 9:22–24). </p>
<p> Certain parts of the animal, such as the breast and the right thigh, were considered to be the best portions and were reserved for the most honored participants in the meal. Guests were always served before family members. The host would also sit with the guests to encourage them to eat and see to all their needs, as related in the story of Abraham, who waited on his visitors while they ate.[60] </p>
<p> Sacrificial meals were eaten when a portion of a sacrifice was reserved for the priest (kohen) or the ordinary Israelite who brought the offering was permitted to eat a portion with his family at a festive meal. The offerings considered "most holy" were eaten by the males of the priests in the court of the Temple sanctuary (Leviticus 7:9–10). The meal was considered to be a part of the priest’s duties. </p>
<p> Other offerings could be eaten by the priests with their families in any ritually clean place (Leviticus 10:14). The ordinary Israelite had to eat his share within a fixed time, with his family, guests, and any Levites and strangers that he invited.[95][96] </p>
<p> Depending on the type of sacrifice, the animals that were brought as sacrifices could be a lamb, kid, goat, ram, calf, bull or cow; bird offerings were doves and turtledoves (pigeons).[97] Of these, the guilt offering (asham) (Leviticus 5) and the communal peace offering (shalmei tzibur) (Leviticus 23:19–29) were eaten only by the male priests (kohanim). </p>
<p> Other offerings, such as the Firstborn offering (Numbers 18:17–18), could be eaten by the priests and other members of their households, while for the personal peace offering (shalmei yachid) (Leviticus 3) and Thanksgiving offering (Leviticus 7:31–34), the breast and thigh meat were eaten by the priests and other members of their households and the remainder by ordinary Israelites. The Tithe offering (Leviticus 27:32) could be eaten by anyone and the Passover offering (Exodus 12) was eaten by all who had purchased a share in the sacrifice.[95][98] </p>
<p> Meal offerings called mincha all consisted primarily of flour and were either completely or partially burned on the altar. Those not entirely burned on the altar were eaten by the priests. Some mincha offerings were fried or baked before being offered. Types of mincha included fine flour (solet) mixed with oil and of which a portion was given to the kohen; flour mixed with oil and fried on a griddle or on a pan; bread called challot mixed with oil and baked in an oven; and wafers (rekikim) smeared with oil baked in an oven.[98] </p>
<p> There were also baked goods, all made of wheat flour and baked in an oven, which were not burned on the altar. These were the twelve unleavened and specially shaped showbreads, eaten by the priests after they had been displayed; two loaves of leavened bread prepared for the festival of Shavuot and eaten by the priests; thanksgiving breads, which included leavened bread, unleavened bread, unleavened wafers and scalded loaves, with one of each kind given to the priests and the remainder eaten by the owner and guests; and the unleavened loaves and wafers accompanying the Nazirite’s sacrificial ram, one of each kind given to the priests and the remainder eaten by the Nazirite and guests.[98] </p>
<p> Whole extended families or clans also participated in a sacrifice that was offered on occasions such as the New Moon, and it is referred to as both the "sacrifice of days" and a kinship sacrifice. </p>
<p> In the early Israelite period, before the centralization of sacrificial offerings as an exclusive part of the Temple services, these sacrifices were offered at various locations. David is described as leaving Saul’s table to participate with his family in Bethlehem (1 Samuel 20:6) and Elkanah goes to Shiloh to participate with his household in the annual sacrifice (1 Samuel 1:21).[96] </p>
<p> Perhaps the oldest and most important feast celebrated by the Jews is the Passover. The original feast, with its origins in the story of the Exodus, consisted of a sacrificial lamb, bitter herbs and unleavened bread eaten by each family at home. Under the Israelite monarchy, and with the establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem, the sacrifice and celebration of Passover became centralized as one of the three pilgrimage festivals. Families who were able to travel to Jerusalem ate the Passover meal together in Jerusalem. Those who could not make the pilgrimage celebrated the holiday by holding a special meal and observing the Feast of Unleavened Bread.[93] </p>
<p> In addition to requiring that certain foods be eaten for sacred purposes, the Israelite diet was shaped by religious practices which prohibited the consumption of certain foods, both in terms of the animals permissible for eating, and the manner of their preparation. The cuisine of the Israelites thus differed from that of their neighbors in significant ways. For example, ancient Mesopotamian recipes describe foods cooked with animal blood and milk added to meat stews; this would have been avoided by the ancient Israelites.[11][15] </p>
<p> Only animals specifically slaughtered for food or for use in the sacrificial service could be eaten.[36] Detailed lists of which animals, birds, and fish could be eaten and which were prohibited appear in the Bible (Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14:3–21), and animal bones found in the archaeological record tend to support this, with some exceptions. </p>
<p> For the Israelites, food was one way for self-definition. While it is impossible to know to what extent dietary laws were observed, self-definition is most likely the basis for certain biblical lists of different kinds of animals permitted or forbidden for consumption.[11] The taboo against eating certain animals, particularly the pig, may have developed from the early Iron Age.[61][99] </p>
<p> Archaeological evidence from various sites shows that the consumption of pork, while limited, was higher in the early Iron Age but had mostly disappeared during the later Iron Age. Sites in the highlands and the coastal plains show low levels of pig utilization in the early Iron Age, but on the coastal plain, excavations such as Ekron show a higher consumption of pig; this is usually associated with the arrival of the Philistines. </p>
<p> However, even at Philistine sites, pig remains were a small proportion of the bones discovered, and these decline after the initial period of settlement. This may have been due to unsuitable environmental factors for raising pigs.[100] </p>
<p> At archaeological excavations at Mount Ebal in Samaria, from the period immediately after the Israelite conquest, animal bones discovered were only from animals considered permissible, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and deer.[101] </p>
<p> In addition, some taboos did not relate to the source of the food but to the way in which they were prepared, as in the prohibition against boiling a young goat in its mother’s milk (and mentioned in the Bible in three separate instances: Exodus 23:19, Exodus 34:26, Deuteronomy 14:21). </p>
<p> Milk and its by-products served as offerings in Near-Eastern pagan worship to gods and kings. Milk was used in connection with the phenomenon of reproduction, and a goat kid would be cooked in its mother's milk.[36] Thus, the Israelite practice was to avoid an act similar to that carried out by the Canaanites as part of their cult worship (Ezra 9:1).[101] </p>
<p> The Israelites believed that since an animal’s blood represented its life, its blood should not be consumed (Deuteronomy 12:23–24). The blood of a slaughtered animal was thus drained before the meat was used and the blood itself was not used as a cooking liquid or drink.[15] </p>
<p> There are no biblical lists containing forbidden plants, so it can be assumed that any plant or fruit was permissible as food, with their use limited only by taste, or toxicity (for example, 2 Kings 4:39–40) and the fulfillment of religious requirements such as the tithes.[11] </p>

<p> A guide to eating fruit in Animal Crossing: New Horizons </p>
<p> Animal Crossing: New Horizons has slightly changed the way we use the fruit on our islands. Originally, the ability to eat fruit was a strange, wasteful feature that didn’t do anything helpful for the player. Rather, eating fruit was just a way to throw out resources and money-makers. However, New Horizons has given eating fruit a new life and ability. </p>
<p> Eating fruit adds gameplay to an already-expanded and ever-growing game. But initially, it’s not entirely clear what eating fruit can really do, which can lead to some problems later on. Here is everything you need to know about eating fruit. </p>
<p> What does eating fruit do? </p>
<p> There are two abilities fruit grants you: Picking up trees and breaking rocks. It doesn’t matter what type of fruit you eat, and you can store the power of 10 fruits at a time. You can see how much fruit is in your system in the upper left-hand corner. A number out of 10 will appear after you’ve eaten some fruit, and each time you use one of the abilities, the number will go down. </p>
<p> With an apple, orange, peach, pear, cherry, or coconut in your virtual stomach, you can take a shovel to a tree and pick it right up. Your villager will pocket the tree and you can plant it, without the need of a shovel, in a new spot. </p>
<p> Also using your shovel, you can hit a rock. Rather than doling out money or resources like clay, stone, or iron nuggets, it’ll break. You won’t get all of the material you normally would when hitting a rock, up to eight, though. A broken rock leaves just one resource in its place. </p>
<p> Why should I eat fruit? </p>
<p> The ability to pick up trees allows you to move a tree in an awkward spot without losing it. This is especially useful when crafting your ideal island layout. I moved the most trees when I first began laying down paths. I didn’t want to lose the island greenery, especially if it was growing valuable foreign fruit. Moving it even just one space over is an easy fix. </p>
<p> You can also visit the island of a friend that has a different native fruit. Pick up the tree and leave one behind with your native fruit. Pocketing fruit trees rather than shaking them and planting the fruit in the ground means skirting the three-day waiting period before anything grows. This is also useful when gathering coconut trees from mystery islands or if you land on one of the rare spots bearing foreign fruit. </p>
<p> Breaking rocks can solve the same issue when you find they get in the way. Breaking a rock forces the rock to respawn in a different place. This is a technique a lot of players who want to create rock gardens use to move their rocks from one place to another. If you find a rock in an inconvenient spot, mine those resources or Bell bags and break it. </p>
<p> Still, it’s imperative to remember that your island will respawn only one rock each day. So, if you have more than one rock that needs to be relocated, it’s most beneficial to break only one of them per day. The new geodes will show up in a random place, so you might still have some work to do until you can achieve your preferred design. Nevertheless, as with most things in Animal Crossing, it requires some time before you can begin to see a profit. </p>
<p> How do I remove the fruit buff? </p>
<p> Maybe you accidentally ate too much fruit; it happens. Instead of forgetting and unintentionally demolishing your precious rocks, get that fruit out. The simplest thing you can do is pick up a tree and replant it. We promise you that it won’t hurt or alter the tree, whether it bears fruit or not. </p>
<p> For a more practical method, we suggest popping a squat on a toilet. Animal Crossing has always featured toilets as furniture pieces. New Horizons made them valuable. Resting on one eliminates the fruit buff and immediately flushes as you remove yourself from the porcelain throne. </p>

<p> What Animals Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> By Staff WriterLast Updated March 29, 2020 </p>

<p> Many animals feed on fruit, such as birds, fruit bats, mice, civets, deer and chimpanzees. Some animals subsist entirely on fruit while others, such as foxes, feed on a variety of foods including fruit. </p>
<p> Fruit bats live entirely on fruits, such as mangoes, bananas and avocados. They are important pollinators. As the bats sip nectar from flowers, pollen gets caught in their fur and carried to other flowers. The seeds from the fruit are distributed through the bats' excrement. Fruit bats are distinct from their insect-eating cousins. They have small ears, long noses and resemble foxes. </p>
<p> Orangutans are another mammal with a fruit-filled diet. Ninety percent of their food is fruit, coming from at least 400 different types of plants and trees. Their favorite food is a durian, a spine-covered fruit with a strong aroma. Orangutans play an important role in the life cycle of fruit by dispersing the seeds throughout their rain forest home. Many of those seeds must pass through the orangutans; digestive tracts in order to grow. </p>
<p> Many species of birds, including the American robin, blue jay, scarlet tanager, bluebird, purple finch and house wren eat fruit when available, particularly berries, such as cherries, raspberries, blueberries and elderberries. </p>

<p> The One Food to Eat After Getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, Says Science </p>
<p> Feeling under the weather after getting the COVID-19 vaccine? When we're not feeling 100%, it's common to turn to the foods that always comfort us and make us feel better—like a mug of steaming tea or a bowl of chicken soup. If this is something you're craving, take this as your sign to reach for those things. Why? Because chicken soup is the best food to eat after getting the vaccine. </p>
<p> Here's why chicken soup truly is for the soul, and for even more healthy eating tips, be sure to check out our list of The 7 Healthiest Foods to Eat Right Now. </p>
<p> Your body will be in a state of inflammation post-vaccine. </p>
<p> According to the CDC, you may experience some adverse side effects of taking the COVID-19 vaccine. While this doesn't happen for everyone, some vaccine patients have mentioned experiencing side effects for a few hours after taking the vaccine, including fevers, chills, tiredness, and a headache. </p>
<p> In a Q&A with Cleveland Clinic, Thaddeus Stappenbeck, MD, PhD, says that these side effects are coming from inflammation that is happening within your body. Your body is reacting to the spike protein and is working to fight off the simulated infection. Sore arms, fevers, muscle aches are all common when your immune system is fighting something. </p>
<p> This is why eating immune-boosting foods is important for your recovery, particularly foods with a high-water content. The CDC also states that drinking plenty of fluids is important for recovery after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. This means any anti-inflammatory foods that can also hydrate your body will help immensely with your recovery—especially these 8 Best Foods To Eat Before and After Getting the COVID Vaccine. </p>

<p> What Should You Eat Before and After the COVID Vaccine? Here’s What a Nutritionist Says </p>
<p> Soup is a great anti-inflammatory food to turn to. </p>
<p> In particular, broth-based soup—like chicken noodle, minestrone, or a simple bone broth—is a great food to slurp on if you're feeling under the weather. Plus, if your soup is full of good immune-boosting foods (like kale, beans, lentils, potato, broccoli) you're giving your immune system even more of a boost with that meal. </p>
<p> This brings us back to the trusty ol' chicken soup. If you have to pick any soup to have after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, chicken soup would be your best bet. According to CHEST Journal, chicken soup actually does have "beneficial medicinal activity" when consumed and has a "mild anti-inflammatory effect" on the body. While it's unclear which particular element of the soup is helpful, The UCLA Center for East-West Medicine says that including all of those classic elements (chicken, onions, carrots, celery, parsley, salt, and pepper) have been proven to help fight inflammatory infection. </p>
<p> If you don't necessarily feel like eating anything, sipping on a cup of bone broth can also be a great substitute. According to Healthline, bone broth contains an amino acid called glycine and arginine, which have strong anti-inflammatory effects. </p>
<p> So whether it be a steaming cup of bone broth or a hearty bowl of chicken noodle soup, be sure to treat yourself to this best food to eat after getting the vaccine. Especially if you're making our Cozy Crock-Pot Chicken Noodle Soup Recipe. </p>

<p> Are Humans ‘Designed’ To Eat Meat? </p>
<p> We have short, soft fingernails, not claws and our canine teeth are small and blunt and have no chance of penetrating a hide </p>
<p> Share: </p>

<p> Reading Time: 4 minutes </p>
<p> Do you think that our little canine teeth show that we are natural meat-eaters? If so, you are not alone, but you are wrong. </p>
<p> Consider how carnivores eat, you might not (literally) have the stomach for it; could you snatch up a rabbit and tear into the flesh with your bare teeth like a lion does? </p>
<p> Their canines reach up to seven centimeters in length and can rip just about anything apart, yours can’t. </p>
<p> Comparing carnivores and herbivores </p>
<p> Carnivores have sharp teeth and claws that help them to rip their prey apart, tearing off chunks of raw meat and ‘wolfing’ them down without the aid of a knife and fork. Their acidic stomachs help to digest flesh quickly and their short intestines allow the rapid expulsion of rotting meat remains. </p>
<p> The diet of wolves, for example, consists mainly of meat from large prey such as elks, with nutrient-dense organs eaten first followed by muscle tissue. When carnivores eat saturated fat from meat it does them no harm, we, on the other hand, respond very differently – saturated fat clogs up our arteries increasing our risk of heart disease and stroke. </p>
<p> Herbivores, such as rabbits, horses and sheep, chew from side-to-side and have longer intestines to absorb nutrients. Their saliva (and ours) contains amylase, an enzyme that helps digest starchy carbohydrates found in bread, rice and other whole grains. </p>
<p> Carnivores don’t spend as much time chewing nor do they consume many carbohydrates, so there is no need for amylase in their saliva. Their strong jaws can only open and shut and are incapable of moving from side to side as ours do. </p>
<p> Human beings have characteristics of herbivores </p>
<p> We have short, soft fingernails, not claws and our canine teeth are small and blunt and have no chance of penetrating a hide. When asked if humans are herbivores, carnivores or omnivores, Dr William C. Roberts, Editor-in-Chief, of The American Journal of Cardiology said: “Although most of us conduct our lives as omnivores in that we eat flesh as well as vegetables and fruits, human beings have characteristics of herbivores, not carnivores.” </p>
<p> The Palaeolithic, or hunter-gatherer, diet as a model for modern human nutrition was first proposed in the 1980s by US anthropologists Boyd Eaton and Melvin Konner. It assumed our ancestors ate mostly lean meat and fish, with some fruit and vegetables, but no dairy, grains or pulses – a diet high in protein and low in carbs. Paleo promoters reckon the mismatch between this diet and contemporary Western diets is responsible for the current high levels of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. </p>
<p> The evidence </p>
<p> The evidence shows something different. Charred fragments found in 170,000-year-old ashes in a cave in southern Africa suggest the real Paleo diet included lots of roasted vegetables rich in carbohydrates, similar to modern potatoes. </p>
<p> At a Stone Age site in Israel, more than 9,000 remains of edible plants provided more compelling evidence that our ancient ancestors enjoyed a varied, plant-based diet, including root vegetables, leafy veg, celery, figs, nuts, seeds and chenopodium seeds (similar to quinoa). </p>
<p> Writing about our ancient ancestors in Horizon, the EU Research and Innovation magazine, Dr Amanda Henry, Associate Professor at the Faculty of Archaeology at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said: “Plants were the staples. They were the foods that formed the basis of our calories in most environments.” </p>
<p> The trend continues throughout our history, with geochemical analysis of grains and pulses from Neolithic sites confirming that early farmers also relied much more heavily on plant protein than previously thought. So, only in recent times, it seems, did we switch to relying so heavily on animal protein. </p>
<p> A flawed notion </p>
<p> The notion that we are designed to eat meat has many other flaws. The average life expectancy of our ancient ancestors was around 30 years, so even if they did live on a diet of meat and more meat (they didn’t), they simply wouldn’t have lived long enough to develop heart disease. </p>
<p> Paleo pundits assume that our biology has not changed from the Palaeolithic era that began over three million years ago but genetic evidence doesn’t agree and shows that our bodies have adapted over time to suit a plant-based diet – and that includes producing more amylase in our saliva. Domesticated dogs produce much more amylase than wolves from whom they evolved – not in their saliva but from their pancreases – allowing them, too, to thrive on starch-rich diets. </p>
<p> Adapted to plant foods </p>
<p> Another adaptation that points to a plant-based diet is our ability to build long-chain fatty acids, important for brain development and cognitive function. </p>
<p> Neolithic farmers probably ate less of these than their predecessors and evidence shows how we developed enzymes to build these long-chain fats from the short ones found widely in nuts, seeds and their oils. </p>
<p> Plant foods fuelled our evolution </p>
<p> Despite the evidence that plant foods fuelled our evolution and that we are more suited to a plant-based diet, the meaty myths persist, including the notion that meat made us smart. </p>
<p> The ‘expensive-tissue hypothesis’, proposed in the 1990’s by British scientists Leslie Aiello and Peter Wheeler, states that the high energy requirement of our relatively large brains is offset by a corresponding reduction in our gut size. The theory is that eating meat enabled us to reduce the size of our gut, freeing up energy for the brain. </p>
<p> But it’s not as simple as that. Researchers say that the discovery of fire and cooking improved the quality of our diet by making food easier to digest. We also saved energy by walking upright, by growing more slowly and reproducing later and it was these factors that fuelled the growth in our brain size. </p>
<p> Meat and illness </p>
<p> Far from tearing animals apart with our teeth, we aren’t even suited to eating raw meat or cooked meat, even at moderate levels, as it is linked to a wide range of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer – in fact, all the big killer diseases. </p>
<p> The typical Western diet, packed with meat, dairy and processed food, is linked to a wide range of illnesses and diseases but a Paleo diet is not the answer. All major health bodies recommend reducing meat consumption, not only for your own health but for the planet too, because animal agriculture is having a devastating effect on the environment. </p>

<p> I can't eat fish - is there a way to still get its nutritional benefits? </p>
<p> This article was published more than 9 years ago. Some information in it may no longer be current. </p>
<p> I know that eating fish a few times a week is really healthy/nourishing for one's diet, however, I cannot eat fish as I'm allergic to all types. A) What nourishment is contained in fish? B) What can one eat in their diet to get the same nourishment? </p>
<p> The answer </p>
<p> Story continues below advertisement </p>
<p> You're right, fish is very nutritious. It's an excellent source of protein that's low in saturated fat. It also contains nutrients that may benefit the brain such as iron, vitamin E, selenium. But most of the positive attention that's been given to fish has to do with its omega-3 fat content. </p>
<p> Cold water fish like salmon, trout, sardines, mackerel and herring contain two omega-3 fatty acids called DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). People with higher blood levels of these omega-3 fatty acids have a lower risk of heart disease, heart attack, coronary death and Alzheimer's disease. </p>
<p> With respect to heart health, omega-3 fats in oily fish make the blood less likely to form clots, lower blood triglyceride levels and protect against irregular heartbeats that can cause sudden cardiac death. </p>
<p> Since you are allergic to the protein in fish you can't get these two omega-3 fatty by eating fish or taking a fish oil supplement. Although fish oil supplements do not contain protein – only fish oil – most people who are allergic to fish don't take a chance by supplementing with fish oil. The same is true for foods like milk, eggs and yogurt that are fortified with DHA from fish oil. </p>
<p> There are other options for you to get omega-3 fats. DHA supplements made from plants – not fish – are available. These contain DHA derived from algae. These supplements are marketed to vegetarians but there are also suitable for people allergic to fish. I suggest asking for this product at a good quality natural food store or supplement store. </p>
<p> You'll also find an omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in certain plant foods. Good sources of ALA include flax oil, ground flaxseed, chia seeds, walnuts, canola oil and soybeans. </p>
<p> Research suggests that a regular intake of ALA helps protect from heart disease, but the data is much less compelling than the evidence for DHA and EPA. Still, since you don't eat fish, getting ALA from your diet could lower the odds of developing heart disease. </p>
<p> Story continues below advertisement </p>
<p> ALA does not have any known function in the brain however. Only a very small amount of the ALA we consume is converted to DHA in the body, an omega-3 fat that does benefit the brain. What's more, this conversion becomes even less efficient as we age. </p>
<p> ALA is considered an essential fat, meaning our bodies can't make it and it must be obtained from the diet. Adult women need 1.1 grams per day (1,100 milligrams) and men require 1.6 grams (1,600 milligrams). It's not hard to get your ALA. One teaspoon of flax oil provides 2.4 grams, a teaspoon of canola oil offers 0.4 grams, and ½ cup of soybeans delivers 0.5 grams of ALA. </p>

<p> I always have a problem with this word usage. When I want to ask someone if they ate or they didn't. </p>
<p> It is called "do-support"; we use the auxiliary "do" to from questions. You may like to search "do-support" on the internet. – Cardinal Sep 6 '16 at 8:24 </p>
<p> A simple rule to remember: you don't have to conjugate to eat, because you already conjugated to do. After do, you just use the bare infinitive. – stangdon Sep 6 '16 at 14:55 </p>
<p> 3 Answers 3 </p>
<p> You would never say "Did you ate?". In this specific context you would use "Did you eat?" or "Have you eaten?" </p>
<p> You can use "Ate" as a verb to simplify other sentences, for example: "I ate today" rather than "I have eaten today". </p>
<p> Ate is the preterite conjugation of eat and is used when conjugating without the verbs "do" or "have" (therefore, you do not use "ate" when asking a question, only when stating a fact). </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> "I ate that." </p>
<p> "We ate your food, Blake." </p>
<p> Eat is the infinitive form and is used when conjugating alongside the verb "do", such as when giving a command or asking a question about whether an action took place. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> "Do not eat that or I'll take away your phone." </p>
<p> "Did you eat my empanadas?" </p>
<p> Eaten is the past participle and is used when conjugating alongside the verb "have", such as when asking about the current state of the subject of the sentence or stating something that is not necessarily a fact. </p>
<p> "Have you eaten today?" </p>
<p> "Have you ever eaten ravioli?" </p>
<p> "I might have eaten your leftovers." </p>
<p> As mentioned by Avery Ross, these categories can often overlap depending on the tone that you want to convey. "I ate today" and "I have eaten today" are equivalent in meaning. </p>
<p> As an aside, you may use ate when asking questions, but only when it is not preceded by the verb "to do" (example: "You ate last night?"). However, this is usually confusing unless said in response to something that suggests that the subject did eat last night, such as an empty takeout container in the living room. When asking if the subject ate after talking about something unrelated, you should use eat (example: "Did you eat last night?"). </p>
<p> Remember this rule of thumb and would never be confused in the future: " is never followed by a word in the past tense". So "Did you ate?" is wrong because "ate" is in the past tense. </p>

<p> Do Axolotls Eat Fish? </p>

<p> Do you want to own axolotls, but you already have some fish in your tank? Or you want to add some fish next to your axolotl, and you don’t know what will happen. Will axolotl eat your fish? </p>
<p> The answer is yes, axolotls can consume fish, especially the smaller fish. In fact, many axolotl owners feed their amphibians smaller fish as a part of the diet, which goes to show that they will happily consume the fish. With larger fish species, this doesn’t usually occur, and especially if the fish has the ability to defend itself. But for smaller fish, it can happen. </p>
<p> That’s why you have to be wary if you want to keep axolotls with fish in the tank. It’s better to know which fish species will be better for axolotls and will not get eaten. That’s what we’re here for; we’ll talk about which fish species are more prone for being eaten by axolotls, and what you can do to reduce the chance. </p>
<p> Should You Feed Live Fish to Axolotls? </p>
<p> As we have already mentioned, many axolotl owners decide to feed the axolotls live fish, which the axolotls will gladly eat. In fact, axolotls are known for eating just about anything that comes in their way. So yes, they’ll eat the live fish, and you can have the fish as a part of their diet. </p>
<p> But, feeding the live fish to axolotls should be done with caution. First of all, live fish can have some parasites or diseases that can rub off on the axolotl, and can make your axolotl sick if you are not careful. That’s why the fish that you feed to axolotls should be thoroughly vetted, or you should avoid it altogether. </p>
<p> Live fish can be an important part of the axolotl’s diet. They provide several beneficial nutrients, such as proteins and fish fats that will keep the axolotl healthy. But they should be checked before you feed them. </p>
<p> For example, goldfish can carry several parasites that can threaten the life of an axolotl. The best way to feed them live fish is to breed the fish at home. If you can afford to, you should get a separate tank where you will breed the smaller fish. </p>
<p> What Fish Can Axolotls Eat? </p>
<p> Axolotls should only be fed the fish that will feed in their mouths. This includes the smaller fish that will not be too fast for the axolotls to be caught. Additionally, you can feed them the smaller fish with tweezers so that they won’t get away from the axolotls. </p>
<p> Some of the smaller fish species that can be fed to axolotls include: </p>
<p> Guppies or other subspecies of guppies, </p>
<p> Mollies, </p>
<p> Goldfish (they should be vetted so they are without parasites) </p>
<p> Other smaller and slow-moving fish. </p>
<p> We should also take a look at which fish are probably not the best for axolotls. As we know, these animals are not too fast when it comes to swimming and moving around, so it’s probably not the best idea to feed them fast-moving fish. </p>
<p> If you do so, you should consider feeding them with tweezers, or you should not feed them such fish altogether. Some of these fish species that you shouldn’t feed to axolotls include: </p>
<p> Tetras </p>
<p> Danios </p>
<p> Other schooling or fast-swimming fish. </p>
<p> Even if these fish are small enough for the axolotl to consume, they won’t be able to catch them, so they are not the best way to feed your axolotls. If you do consider live fish as a form of food, take a look at the fish above. </p>
<p> Can Axolotls Eat Fish Food? </p>
<p> Axolotls can eat fish food, especially the meat-based fish foods. These can include fish pellets or other types of food. Though, you would want to avoid feeding your axolotls plant-based foods as they are strictly carnivorous. </p>
<p> Another thing to keep in mind is that the fish food should in no way be the only source of food for your axolotls. You should try to keep as much variety as you can when it comes to the diet, and this includes various live foods, frozen foods that you can combine with the fish food. </p>
<p> As for the best type of food, you should avoid the pellets that can expand and can cause impaction for axolotls. Instead, opt for more compact fish foods that won’t expand as much when you put them in the water. </p>
<p> In order to keep a varied diet, you should try to incorporate live foods such as earth worms, trout, or salmon. Sure, these foods can cost quite a bit, but they should be added from time to time. They carry essential nutrients and minerals that are just not found in regular fish foods. Other foods that can keep a variety are crickets, grasshoppers, and bloodworms </p>
<p> Can Axolotls Eat Snails? </p>
<p> Snails can also be considered as a type of food for axolotls. Though, you will also want to be moderate with snails. If the axolotl eats too many snails, it can clog their intestines, which can lead to congestion, and even impaction. </p>
<p> Another thing to keep in mind is that you shouldn’t feed them snails with particularly hard shells. Instead, you can get smaller snail species and make sure that the shells are not too hard, or remove them first before you feed them to your axolotl. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Keeping a variety in the axolotl’s diet is essential for keeping them healthier for a long time, and ensuring longevity. Axolotls will eat live fish or frozen fish, but they should in no way be the only or primary source of food. </p>
<p> In addition, many fish species can be bad for axolotls, because they carry parasites and diseases that can spread onto the axolotls, causing them to suffer from these illnesses. Before you feed them the fish, make sure they are vetted properly. The best way is probably to breed the fish at home and feed them to your axolotls. </p>
<p> Questions & Answers </p>
<p> My axolotls love the two tiger gouramis I have. Granted it’s a 55 gallon but nonetheless. My gouramis are always hanging around and next to my axolotls. Never once has my axolotl attacked my fish. That’s just my experience though. Good luck </p>
<p> Hey! Thanks for sharing your experience with us! I’m sure there are other special cases where axolotls will do ok with fish, but these are rare. </p>

<p> Can Axolotls Eat Fish Food? </p>
<p> When you buy through my referral links, I may earn a commission. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. </p>
<p> For many new axolotl owners comes the question of diet – what will the axolotl eat, and can I feed the fish food. This question arises due to these owners already having a fish tank with other fish. Therefore, buying the same foods for axolotls and your fish can save you money and the time for picking the food. But can axolotls eat fish food? </p>
<p> Yes, axolotls can eat fish food, but only the food you will feed to your carnivorous fish. Axolotls are purely carnivorous animals as well, so they won’t like any plant-based foods or flakes. They will eat meat-based fish pellets or just about anything you feed to your carnivorous fish – live foods, frozen foods, or pellets. </p>
<p> There are some things that you should avoid, though, and we’ll go more into detail in this article. </p>
<p> Food the Axolotls Can Eat </p>
<p> Let’s take a look at what axolotls will eat. </p>
<p> Live Insects </p>
<p> Axolotls will love to eat live insects, especially the ones that are easily available in your local pet store, or you can come up with your own solutions with live insects. Perhaps you can collect the live insects from nature, or you can start to harvest your own little pool of live insects that you’ll feed to axolotls. </p>
<p> Crickets, worms, daphnia, and anything that’s not too big for their mouths and that doesn’t have too strong of a shell. Be careful, though, if you’re collecting these live insects on your own you might want to make sure that they are not toxic or anything. </p>
<p> Frozen Foods </p>
<p> Frozen foods are perhaps one of the most popular ways of feeding axolotls; it can be a very tasty treat for them, or you can have the frozen foods as the staple of their diets. When it comes to frozen foods, there’s usually plenty of choice, and it can be bought in your local pet store as well. </p>
<p> Here, bloodworms are a very popular choice for axolotls. Most likely, these will be available in your vicinity, but you can always order them from Amazon. Bloodworms are packed with proteins and beneficial ingredients that help improve the health of an axolotl, and will enable the young axolotls to grow. </p>
<p> Another good choice is tubifex, or sludge worms, which also come readily available in many pet shops around the world. The best thing about it is that you can feed it to both your axolotl and your fish. </p>
<p> Brine Shrimp </p>
<p> Your axolotl will love brine shrimp. It’s one of the tastiest foods for fish and axolotls, and they are full of beneficial fatty acids and lipids, as well as protein. Just like other foods, these should probably be readily available near you, or you can order it online. </p>
<p> A good idea is also to hatch the brine shrimp at home and culture them on your own; it would take some time to establish an effective system, but it can save you a lot of resources on the long-term. They are also a favorite food of some of the fish. </p>
<p> Earthworms </p>
<p> Earthworms are also a popular choice among axolotl owners, however, there is some debate when it comes to this type of food. Some people swear by frozen earthworms, arguing that this type of food is the most beneficial for baby axolotls, as they contain a better array of nutrients and is easier to feed. </p>
<p> Other people argue that frozen earthworms are not the best for axolotls as they get cold and mushy, and the axolotl might not like that. However, it comes down to your personal preference and you should certainly try feeding both frozen earthworms as well as the live ones. </p>
<p> In any case, earthworms present one of the best choices for feeding axolotls because they taste great and contain essential nutrients such as protein nutrients, as well as some beneficial fats. </p>
<p> What to Feed Axolotls when Out of Food? </p>
<p> At one point in time, you might experience a food crisis, a time when you’ll have no foods to feed your axolotls. Or, you haven’t been to the pet store in a while and the foods are running out, and the store is closed for the next couple of days. What to do then? </p>
<p> Well, it turns out that there are still plenty of options, ones that might require some more effort from your part. You can buy these foods in most grocery stores or supermarkets, so there is no excuse for feeding them these foods. These are the best foods to feed to your axolotls when you run out of other foods: </p>
<p> Raw or cooked chicken meat. </p>
<p> Raw salmon. </p>
<p> Beef heart. </p>
<p> Raw or cooked beef. </p>
<p> As you can see, it’s better to buy quality foods that might cost a bit more, but it will have tremendous effects on your axolotl’s health. Note that you can feed them these foods always as a treat or a side dish. </p>
<p> What to Avoid Feeding to Axolotls? </p>
<p> There are some things to avoid from feeding to your axolotls: </p>
<p> Processed meats. These include foods such as salami, and this should be self-explanatory. These meats and foods go through a long process where they get loaded with preservatives and other chemicals that can harm your axolotls. </p>
<p> Feeder fish. Plenty axolotl owners still swear by this method, but we can tell you to avoid it, because the feeder fish can actually hurt your axolotl. That’s because feeder fish can contain diseases or parasites that can easily be transferred to your axolotl. </p>
<p> Bugs with hard exoskeleton. This one is also pretty obvious, and it’s clear that hard shells can cause axolotls digestive problems. Some axolotls will likely not even eat these. </p>
<p> Algae wafers. Not the best food for axolotls considering they are carnivorous animals. </p>
<p> Axolotls will likely not eat bread, and it can also cause digestive problems. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> To conclude, axolotls can eat fish foods, but only certain types of fish food. Herbivorous types such as flakes should be avoided, and axolotls will prefer meat-based foods instead. </p>

<p> Sweet foods often appear at the end of a meal as dessert, but when the sweet treat is fresh fruit, you may decide to start with it instead. High in fiber and loaded with important micronutrients, fruit makes an excellent first course for any meal of the day. It's also a good way to fit in part of your daily recommended 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit. </p>
<p> Nutrition </p>
<p> Many fruits are filled with essential micronutrients, making them a high-value carbohydrate choice. Citrus fruits are famously high in vitamin C. Bananas contain vitamin B6 and potassium. Many orange and reddish fruits, including mango, apricot, cantaloupe and guava, are rich in vitamin A. Because different fruits have an array of nutritional benefits, look for variety in the fruits with which you start your meals. Begin breakfast with pink grapefruit packed with vitamins C and A, try a banana before lunch or dried blueberries with your starter salad at dinner. </p>
<p> Fiber </p>
<p> Most fruits contain fiber, a special kind of carbohydrate that aids in digestion and contributes to good cardiovascular health. Fiber comes in two forms, soluble and insoluble, and both forms are indigestible; this is why fiber has no net calories as part of your diet. By beginning your meal with fruit, you increase your likelihood of getting the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber your body needs daily. Many main dishes lack fiber, so adding it in the form of a fruit course is important. </p>
<p> Benefits for Satiety </p>
<p> Snacking on fruit before a meal might help you feel fuller after you eat. That's because you'll boost your intake of fiber, a special type of carb that doesn't supply calories but does help fill your stomach. Fiber also slows the release of sugar into your bloodstream after a meal, which means you'll have more stable sugar levels -- and avoid the hunger caused by blood sugar crashes. Many fruits, including apples, berries and pears, contain 3 to 5 grams of fiber per serving, so starting every meal with fruit can supply you with enough fiber to make a potential difference in satiety. </p>
<p> Antioxidants </p>
<p> The many vibrant colors of fruits are more than just appealing to the eye; they indicate the presence of antioxidants, naturally occurring compounds that provide protection from harmful free radicals. Chemically reactive free radicals cause damage at the cellular level, but antioxidants help shield cells from this damage, potentially reducing your risk of cancer and heart disease. Beta-carotene, lycopene and lutein are antioxidants commonly found in fruit. To get more antioxidants in your diet, choose colorful fruits such as raspberries, blackberries and plums. </p>

<p> Dr Stephen Mak treats terminal ill cancer patients by an "un-orthodox" way. And many of his patients recover. </p>
<p> Before he used solar energy to clear the illnesses of his patients, he believes on natural healing in the body against illnesses. It is one of the strategies to heal cancer. Another is through Fruit intake. </p>
<p> “As of late, my success rate in curing cancer is about 80%. Cancer patients shouldn't die. The cure for cancer is already found – it’s in the way we eat fruits. It is whether you believe it or not. I am sorry for the hundreds of cancer patients who die under the conventional treatments.” Dr. Mak </p>
<p> EATING FRUITS </p>
<p> We all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths. It's not as easy as you think. It's important to know how and *when* to eat the fruits. </p>
<p> What is the correct way of eating fruits? </p>
<p> - IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS </p>
<p> - FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH </p>
<p> If you eat fruits on empty stomach, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities. </p>
<p> FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD... </p>
<p> Let's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit. The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so due to the bread taken before the fruit. </p>
<p> In the meantime the whole meal of bread & fruit rots and ferments and turns to acid. </p>
<p> The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil. </p>
<p> So please eat your fruits on an *empty stomach* or before your meals! </p>
<p> You have heard people complaining: </p>
<p> “Every time I eat watermelon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat a banana I feel like running to the toilet, etc.. etc..” </p>
<p> Actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit on an empty stomach. </p>
<p> The fruit mixes with the putrefying of other food and produces gas and hence you will bloat! </p>
<p> Greying hair, balding, nervous outburst and dark circles under the eyes all these will *NOT* happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach. </p>
<p> There is no such thing as some fruits, like orange and lemon are acidic, because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter. </p>
<p> If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the * SECRET * of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight. </p>
<p> When you need to drink fruit juice, drink only * fresh* fruit juice. NOT from the cans, packs or bottles. </p>
<p> Don't even drink juice that has been heated up. </p>
<p> Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. You only get its taste. Cooking destroys all the vitamins. </p>
<p> But eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice. </p>
<p> If you should drink the fresh fruit juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it. </p>
<p> You can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse or detoxify your body. </p>
<p> Just eat fruits and drink fresh fruit juice throughout the 3 days. </p>
<p> And you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look! </p>
<p> KIWI: </p>
<p> Tiny but mighty. </p>
<p> This is a good source of potassium, magnesium, vitamin E & fiber. Its vitamin C content is twice that of an orange. </p>
<p> APPLE: </p>
<p> An apple a day keeps the doctor away? </p>
<p> Although an apple has a low vitamin C content, it has antioxidants & flavonoids which enhances the activity of vitamin C thereby helping to lower the risks of colon cancer, heart attack & stroke. </p>
<p> STRAWBERRY: </p>
<p> Protective Fruit. </p>
<p> Strawberries have the highest total antioxidant power among major fruits & protect the body from cancer-causing, blood vessel-clogging and free radicals. </p>
<p> ORANGE: </p>
<p> Sweetest medicine. </p>
<p> Taking 2-4 oranges a day may help keep colds away, lower cholesterol, prevent & dissolve kidney stones as well as lessens the risk of colon cancer. </p>
<p> WATERMELON: </p>
<p> Coolest thirst quencher. </p>
<p> Composed of 92% water, it is also packed with a giant dose of glutathione, which helps boost our immune system. They are also a key source of lycopene the cancer fighting oxidant. </p>
<p> Other nutrients found in watermelon are vitamin C & Potassium. </p>
<p> GUAVA & PAPAYA: </p>
<p> Top awards for vitamin C. They are the clear winners for their high vitamin C content. </p>
<p> Guava is also rich in fiber, which helps prevent constipation. </p>
<p> Papaya is rich in carotene; this is good for your eyes. </p>
<p> Drinking COLD water or drinks after a meal = CANCER </p>
<p> Can you believe this? </p>
<p> For those who like to drink cold water or cold drinks, this article is also applicable to you. </p>
<p> It is nice to have a cup of cold water or cold drinks after a meal. </p>
<p> However, the cold water or drinks will solidify the oily stuff that you have just eaten. </p>
<p> It will slow down the digestion. </p>
<p> Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into FATS and lead to CANCER! </p>
<p> Research has shown that it is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal. </p>
<p> Our friends in the East have long known the benefits of a warm drink after meals, for example its normal custom In Japan to end a meal with a warm cup of Saki or Green Tea. </p>

<p> Myth 1: Always Eat Fruit on an Empty Stomach </p>
<p> This is one of the most prevalent myths regarding when to eat fruit. </p>
<p> It has been popularized through websites and email chains, and seems to have originated from a chef in Singapore. </p>
<p> The myth claims that eating fruit with meals slows digestion and causes food to sit in your stomach and ferment or rot. This myth also claims that eating fruit with meals is what causes gas, discomfort and a range of other unrelated symptoms. </p>
<p> While it’s true that the fiber in fruit can slow the release of food from your stomach, the rest of these claims are false. </p>
<p> Although fruit can cause your stomach to empty more slowly, it does not cause food to sit in your stomach indefinitely. </p>
<p> One study found that in healthy people, fiber slowed the time it took the stomach to empty half its contents from an average of 72 minutes to 86 minutes (1). </p>
<p> While this change in speed is significant, it’s by no means slowing digestion down enough to cause food to spoil in the stomach. </p>
<p> Additionally, slowing the emptying of your stomach is a good thing. It can help you feel full for longer, which might help you eat fewer calories in the long run (2). </p>
<p> But even if fruit did cause food to sit in your stomach for significantly longer than usual, your stomach is specifically designed to prevent the growth of bacteria, which is what causes fermentation and rotting (3). </p>
<p> When food reaches the stomach, it’s mixed with stomach acid, which has a very low pH of about one or two. Your stomach contents become so acidic that most microorganisms cannot grow (3). </p>
<p> This part of digestion occurs partly to help kill bacteria in your food and prevent microbial growth. </p>
<p> As for the rest of these claims, saying that eating fruit with meals is the cause of bloating, diarrhea and discomfort is equally misleading. </p>
<p> There is also no scientific support behind the idea that eating fruit on an empty stomach can affect longevity, fatigue or dark circles under the eyes. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Eating fruit with a meal can slow the emptying of your stomach but only by a small amount. This is actually a good thing as it may help you feel more full and cut back on calories. </p>
<p> Myth 2: Eating Fruit Before or After a Meal Reduces Its Nutrient Value </p>
<p> This myth seems to be an extension of myth number 1. It claims that you need to eat fruit on an empty stomach to reap all of the nutritional benefits. </p>
<p> It claims if you eat fruit right before or after a meal, the nutrients will somehow be lost. </p>
<p> However, this is not at all true. The human body has evolved over time to be as efficient as possible when it comes to extracting nutrients from food. </p>
<p> When you eat a meal, the stomach acts as a reservoir, releasing only small amounts at a time so that your intestines can easily digest it (4). </p>
<p> Also, the small intestine is designed to absorb as many nutrients as possible. </p>
<p> It’s up to 20 feet (six meters) in length, with over 320 square feet (30 square meters) of absorptive area (5). </p>
<p> In fact, studies have shown that your intestines have the ability to absorb twice as many nutrients as the average person consumes in one day (6). </p>
<p> This huge absorptive area means that getting the nutrients from fruit (and the rest of your meal) is easy work for your digestive system, regardless of whether you eat fruit on an empty stomach or with a meal. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Your digestive system is more than prepared to digest and absorb the nutrients from fruit, whether it’s eaten on an empty stomach or with a meal. </p>
<p> Myth 3: If You Have Diabetes, You Should Eat Fruit 1–2 Hours Before or After Meals </p>
<p> The idea is that people with diabetes often have digestive problems, and eating fruit separately from meals somehow improves digestion. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, this is rather bad advice for most people who have diabetes. </p>
<p> There is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that eating fruit separately from a meal improves digestion. </p>
<p> The only difference it might make is that the sugar contained in fruit may enter the bloodstream faster, which is exactly what a person with diabetes should try to avoid. </p>
<p> Rather than eating fruit separately, eating it with a meal or as a snack paired with a food high in protein, fiber or fat is a much better choice for someone with diabetes. </p>
<p> This is because protein, fiber and fat can cause your stomach to release food into the small intestine more slowly (7, 8). </p>
<p> The benefit of this for someone with diabetes is that a smaller amount of sugar is absorbed at a time, leading to a smaller rise in blood sugar levels overall. </p>
<p> For example, studies have shown that just 7.5 grams of soluble fiber — which is found in fruit — can decrease the rise in blood sugar after a meal by 25% (1). </p>
<p> However, it’s true that some people with diabetes develop digestive problems. </p>
<p> The most common issue is called gastroparesis. It happens when the stomach empties slower than normal or not at all. </p>
<p> Although dietary changes can help with gastroparesis, eating fruit on an empty stomach is not one of them. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> For the majority of diabetics, eating fruit on an empty stomach isn’t great advice. Pairing fruit with a meal or snack is usually a better choice. </p>
<p> Myth 4: The Best Time of Day to Eat Fruit Is the Afternoon </p>
<p> There is no real logic behind this idea, and there is also no evidence to support it. </p>
<p> It is claimed that your metabolism slows down in the afternoon and eating a food that’s high in sugar, such as fruit, raises your blood sugar levels and “wakes up” your digestive system. </p>
<p> The truth is that any carb-containing food will temporarily increase your blood sugar while glucose is being absorbed, regardless of the time of day (9). </p>
<p> However, apart from providing your body with energy and other nutrients, this has no special benefit. </p>
<p> There is no need to “wake up” your digestive system, as it’s always prepared to jump into action the moment that food touches your tongue, no matter the time of day. </p>
<p> And while eating a meal high in carbs might temporarily cause your body to use carbs as fuel, it doesn’t change the overall rate of your metabolism (9). </p>
<p> The truth is that there’s no harm in eating fruit in the morning. Fruit is healthy any time of the day. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> There is no evidence or logic behind the idea that fruit should preferably be eaten in the afternoon. Fruit is healthy no matter what time it is. </p>
<p> Myth 5: You Shouldn’t Eat Fruit After 2:00 in the Afternoon </p>
<p> Interestingly, myth number five directly contradicts myth number 4, claiming that you should avoid fruit after 2 p.m. </p>
<p> It seems that this rule originated as part of the “17-Day Diet.” </p>
<p> The theory is that eating fruit (or any carbs) after 2 p.m. raises your blood sugar, which your body does not have time to stabilize before bed, leading to weight gain. </p>
<p> However, there is no reason to fear that fruit will cause high blood sugar in the afternoon. </p>
<p> As mentioned previously, any carb-containing food will raise your blood sugar as the glucose is being absorbed. But there is no evidence that your blood sugar will be raised more after 2 p.m. than any other time of day (10). </p>
<p> There’s also no reason to fear that eating fruit in the afternoon will cause weight gain. </p>
<p> Your body does not simply switch from burning calories to storing them as fat when you go to sleep. Your metabolic rate does tend to decrease as you fall asleep, but you still burn plenty of calories to keep your body running (11, 12). </p>
<p> Many different factors determine whether calories are burned for energy or stored as fat, but avoiding fruit after a certain time of day isn’t one of them. </p>
<p> There is also no evidence that avoiding fruit in the afternoon affects weight. </p>
<p> But there is overwhelming evidence that people who eat lots of fruits and vegetables throughout the day tend to weigh less and are less likely to gain weight (13, 14). </p>
<p> For example, one review of 17 studies found that the people who had the highest intakes of fruit had up to a 17% decrease in the risk of obesity (14). </p>
<p> When it comes to weight loss, eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is one of the best things you can do. It’s a great way to get the nutrients you need, all while filling up on healthy, low-calorie foods. </p>
<p> Furthermore, if you’re avoiding fruit in the afternoon and before bed, you’re eliminating a healthy, whole-food option for a snack or dessert. </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> Eliminating fruit after 2 p.m. has no benefits and doesn’t affect your weight. Eating fruit is a good idea at any time of the day. </p>
<p> So Is There a Best Time to Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> The truth is that any time of the day is a great time to eat fruit. </p>
<p> There is no evidence that you should avoid fruit in the afternoon or around meals. </p>
<p> Fruits are healthy, nutritious and weight loss friendly foods that can be eaten throughout the day. </p>
<p> That being said, there are a few instances when the timing of your fruit intake might make a difference. </p>
<p> If You Want to Lose Weight </p>
<p> Due to the fiber in fruit, eating it may help you feel full for longer. This could cause you to eat fewer calories and may even help you lose weight (15). </p>
<p> However, eating fruit with or right before a meal may increase this effect. It could cause you to eat less of another, higher-calorie food on your plate. </p>
<p> If You Have Type 2 Diabetes </p>
<p> As mentioned before, eating fruit with another food can make a difference for someone with diabetes. </p>
<p> Pairing fruit with another food or meal that’s high in protein, fat or fiber may cause the sugar from fruit to enter the small intestine more slowly (1). </p>
<p> This could result in a smaller rise in blood sugar, compared to eating fruit alone. </p>
<p> If You Have Gestational Diabetes </p>
<p> Gestational diabetes is when a woman develops diabetes during pregnancy. For these women, the change in hormones during pregnancy causes a carb intolerance. </p>
<p> Like for those with type 2 diabetes, eating fruit with a meal is probably a good choice. </p>
<p> This is when pregnancy hormones are the highest, and studies have shown that this is often when carb intolerance is most severe in gestational diabetes (16). </p>
<p> Bottom Line: </p>
<p> For most people, eating fruit at any time of the day is great. However, timing may matter for diabetics or people who want to lose weight. </p>
<p> Take Home Message </p>
<p> Fruit is rich in nutrients and an important part of a healthy diet. </p>
<p> Myths claiming there’s a best or worst time to eat fruit are unfounded and untrue. In truth, these made-up rules only spread confusion and misinformation. </p>
<p> Regardless of the time of day, eating fruit is a sweet, delicious and weight loss friendly way to get plenty of healthy nutrients for your body. </p>

<p> Birds That Eat Fruit - Including Apples! </p>
<p> Melissa Mayntz has been a birder and wild bird enthusiast for 30+ years. She has over 16 years experience writing about wild birds for magazines and websites. </p>
<p> Fruit is a preferred food for many different birds. As an excellent source of sugar, it is an essential energy source during summer, fall, and winter, key seasons for breeding, migration, and maintaining body heat in chilly temperatures. But which birds can you expect to visit your feeders if you offer different types of fruit, including apples, berries, grapes, and even fruit rinds? </p>
<p> About Fruit </p>
<p> Birds can eat many different types of fruit in many different conditions. All fruits that are suitable for human consumption are also nutritious for birds. Birds will also eat other types of fruit that are not typical human foods, such as toxic types of berries, as well as damaged or overripe fruit that would not be tasty to humans. Fruit bits that cling to discarded rinds or large seeds, such as pumpkin seeds, can also be great for feeding birds. The most popular fruits that birds eat include: </p>
<p> Depending on the bird species, the ripeness of the fruit, and the type of fruit, birds might eat the flesh, sip the juice, or both. Small fruits can even be swallowed whole, and birds will visit fruit trees before they are fully ripe and as long as there are a few fruits available after the prime harvest season. On farms and orchards this can be a problem, since birds can easily damage crops before they are ripe enough to harvest. In bird-friendly yards, however, fruit is a great choice for feeding birds because it does not leave as many hulls and wasted debris as most types of birdseed. Planting fruit trees, berry shrubs, and other plants that produce fruit is a great way to feed birds on a budget. </p>
<p> Bird Species That Eat Fruit </p>
<p> There are many different birds that have at least a partially frugivorous diet and will eat fruit regularly. The most familiar birds that will eat fruit include: </p>
<p> While these birds will readily come to bird feeders for fruit, other thrushes, sparrows, tits, woodpeckers, warblers, and towhees will also eat fruit to some extent. In tropical climates, hornbills, toucans, cassowaries, and parrots also have a fruit-based diet. </p>
<p> Attracting Birds With Fruit </p>
<p> There are many ways to offer fruit as a bird food and attract a wide range of hungry species. </p>
<p> Plant fruit trees for birds and fruit-producing berry bushes and shrubs to provide a natural, renewable source of fruit for birds to easily forage. Ideally, choose native varieties that will be more recognizable to local and regional birds. Native plants will also thrive in local climates without needing excessive care or damaging landscapes. </p>
<p> Avoid or minimize pesticide and herbicide use near any fruit-producing plants for birds to avoid any unintended poisoning or toxic effects. If chemical treatments are absolutely necessary, opt for organic options and follow application instructions meticulously to avoid accidental contamination or overuse. </p>
<p> Offer fresh or dried fruit cut into both large and small chunks or slices in open tray feeders or sprinkled on the ground. Fruit chunks can also be offered in a mesh bag or suet cage, or may even be strung along a fun feeder garland for a feeder that is decorative as well as tasty. Leftover rinds can be added to platform feeders or placed on the ground for birds to peck. </p>
<p> Stick large chunks of fruit or fruit halves onto fruit spike feeders near other bird feeding stations. Many oriole feeders have a spike or other feature specifically to accommodate fruit to hold it steady without falling or slipping away from hungry birds. </p>
<p> Freeze fruit whole or cut into chunks in the summer and fall to add to feeders in the winter for birds to enjoy when natural fruit sources are scarce. Local farmer's markets and produce departments may be willing to offer deep discounts on older fruit that is still perfect for birds but less attractive to customers. </p>
<p> Leave damaged or overripe fruit on trees and shrubs in the fall to provide an excellent natural energy source for migrating birds. If it is necessary to protect the trees from birds while some fruit is harvested, opt for nets around the branches you wish to protect while allowing birds to feed on other branches with less desirable fruit. </p>
<p> Only offer as much fruit as birds will eat in a day or two to avoid spoiled fruit that may attract rodents, insects, or other unwanted pests. If the fruit is getting older and fermenting, it is less healthy for birds and should be offered sparingly or composted instead. </p>
<p> If birds do not seem interested in the available fruit, try a different variety that may appeal to their tastes more readily. Apples and oranges are the most popular and most universally accepted fruits to feed birds, and it is not necessary to peel or core the fruit before offering it to birds. </p>
<p> In addition to offering fruit to backyard birds, many fruit-eating birds will also sip nectar and eat jelly. Adding nectar feeders, nectar-rich flowers, and jelly feeders to a backyard bird buffet can attract even more birds that will quickly learn to appreciate all the sources of fruit available. </p>

<p> Can Buddhists Eat Meat? </p>
<p> As we discussed in the Step 3: Code of Ethics, one of the five moral precepts instructs us not to kill living creatures. As beginner Buddhists, we may be confused and concerned about whether eating meat violates this moral precept. While Buddhists, or anyone for that matter, can eat meat that doesn’t mean that you should. </p>
<p> Giving up meat or at least reducing your consumption is likely more in line with the spirit and doctrine of Buddhism and should probably be your goal. Also, many people find that as they progress along the path towards inner peace, they have a natural tendency to move toward vegetarianism. </p>
<p> However, there is not an unanimous agreement among Buddhists worldwide on this point and it is certainly possible to be a good Buddhist and not be a vegetarian. The decision to be a vegetarian or not is a more complicated question than initially meets the eye. Your decision should be made individually, after investigating and considering the environmental impacts and suffering involved under both options. </p>
<p> What can we all agree on? </p>
<p> Let start with what everyone can agree on. We need animals: the tame ones for companions and to love, and wildlife to preserve our fragile ecosystem. We can also agree that a major tenant of Buddhism is to develop a compassion that is all embracing and undiscriminating. </p>
<p> The moral precept that instructs us not to kill without a doubt prohibits the hunting animals, i.e., directly being responsible for causing their death. We should strive to see the world as a unified whole where each thing and creature has its place and function. </p>
<p> How have humans impacted the natural environment? </p>
<p> Unquestionably, the human being as a collective species are exploiting nature to the max and squeezing every last drop out of it without putting anything back. The results? The air and rivers are becoming polluted and poisoned, many animals and plants are heading for extinction, and the slopes of mountains have become barren and eroded. Before we destroy or upset natures delicate balance, we should be very careful. We should strive to develop a little more respect for all life instead of having this crush, kill and destroy mentality. </p>
<p> What are the arguments for becoming a vegetarian? </p>
<p> We should not be under the illusion that animals raised for slaughter by multinational corporations using modern methods are living a carefree life on the farm. On the contrary, multinational corporations use assembly-line methods of production where animals are treated like machines. </p>
<p> These factory farms are concerned about high production and low cost – not with the welfare of the animals. The cruelties include extreme overcrowding and confining, stress and anxiety. As a practical matter, it is impossible to raise animals for food on a large, cost-effective scale without inflicting suffering. </p>
<p> The passive support of these inhumane methods through meat consumption is counter to the pity, sympathy and compassion that Buddhism teaches us to have for all living things. Even if animals are humanely raised and humanely killed (if that is truly possible), should we intentionally be putting scorched animal corpses in our stomachs if not absolutely necessary for our survival? </p>
<p> Change can be difficult </p>
<p> Giving up or reducing your meat consumption may prove challenging because consuming meats has been a lifelong habit for the majority of us. Most of our parents began feeding us meat at an early age under the misguided but honest belief that proteins from chicken and beef were critical for physical and mental growth. There is a common misconception that vegetarian diets lack sufficient protein. This is simply not true. A well-planned vegetarian diet that is focused on plant foods can provide more than sufficient protein. </p>
<p> Examples of plant based foods that are rich in protein include: wheat gluten, tofu and edamame, lentils, chickpeas, beans, green peas, quinoa, oats, rice, nuts, etc. There are also lots of vegetables that contain good sources of protein such as: potatoes, spinach, broccoli, sweet corn, and asparagus. The culture of meat eating is further perpetuated by advertisements and propaganda from the meat industry that meat and fish are the best sources of protein. This has scientifically been proven to be false. </p>
<p> As difficult as it is to change an ingrained habit of eating meat, we should make a serious effort to make our diets as humane as we practically can. It is the best decision for both us as well as other living things. </p>
<p> What are the physical health benefits of giving up meat? </p>
<p> Undisputed world health facts show a correction between those who eat lots of meat and having a shorter life expectancy. Those who eat less protein tend to have higher life expediencies. A diet high in animal protein and fat increases your chances of cancer. Whereas diets low in animal protein and fat but high in vegetable protein and fiber are associated with a lower risk of cancer. </p>
<p> The reason is that animal meat has high levels of saturated fact and cholesterol which is a leading cause of heart disease. Studies have shown that vegetarian have lower levels of both cholesterol and blood pressure than non-vegetarian. Consuming meat also carries additional health risks that are associated how meat is processed on a large scale. Meat processing facilities are often dirty and poorly inspected by government regulators. </p>
<p> Additionally, the consumption of processed meat involves eating human added hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, preservatives, stabilizers and other harmful, foreign substances. Consider the following short story and remember it the next time you think a meat produce looks appetizing: A man who was a vegetarian was served a vegetarian meal on a plan. The man noticed that the woman next to him had also ordered a vegetarian meal. So the man turned to the woman and asked, “Excuse me, but are you also a vegetarian.” The woman replied, “No, I am a meat inspector.” </p>
<p> What are the mental health benefits of giving up meat? </p>
<p> Choosing to become a vegetarian also has a purifying affect on your mind. If you have given up eating meat then you likely know that it is a wonderful feeling to know that no animal had to suffer in order to provide you nourishment. After all, food should be a means of nutritious ourselves; food should not be used merely to satisfy sense desire. If you want to give up eating meat but are having difficult, try to slowly wean yourself from flesh foods. You can try first giving up beef, then poultry and then lastly fish. </p>
<p> What are the arguments for having meat in your diet? </p>
<p> It is true that when you eat meat you are indirectly or partially responsible for killing a living creature. However, it is believed that Buddha may not have been vegetarian and that he may not have taught his disciples to be vegetarians. Buddhist scriptures say that being heartless, arrogant, greedy makes one impure, not the eating of meat. </p>
<p> Here, it’s easy to see how one could eat meat and have a pure heart just as one who does not eat meat could have an impure heart. Buddha’s teaching emphasize the quality of your heart over the contents of your diet. Consuming meat does not necessarily mean that one approves the killing of animals, nor does it necessary mean that bad Karma will result. </p>
<p> As we discussed in our Law of Karma post, Karma is an intentional act and its result. Among meat eaters, few likely associate their hamburger or chicken tenders with a live, suffering animal. As living beings strive to survive, those that succeed inevitably do so at the expense of other living beings. Contrary to popular belief, eating vegetarian food still indirectly involves the killing of animals such as rabbits, squirrels, monkeys, and billions of insects and other ‘pests.’ </p>
<p> How is that possible? The vast agricultural fields need to produce vegetarian products such as wheat, rice and vegetables require the clearing of vast swathes of natural vegetation and animal habitat. After clearing, farms typically spray their crops with large amounts of insecticides and pesticides so that the vegetables arrive on our plates without unsightly holes or blemishes in them. </p>
<p> Just imagine the acreage required to grow enough coffee beans to satisfy one person’s daily coffee habit. Also, imagine if the whole world became vegetarians, animals would multiple in massive numbers. This could quickly become a threat to humans, which would likely lead to animals being killed as they overtook our living areas or posed a risk to our safety. </p>
<p> Reasonable minds can differ </p>
<p> Trying to compare the environmental impact and amount of suffering between a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian diet is a complex endeavor with no definitive outcome. We can likely all agree that both have an environmental impact and cause suffering to living things. While one of the five precepts is do not kill, it also follows that we should not cause another to kill or harm any living creatures. Furthermore, one would definitely have developed a high level of compassion if they chose to avoid meat out of concern for animals and not wanting to be involved in the cruelty of modern industrial farming. </p>
<p> The key is to be mindful of your actions </p>
<p> Buddhism is not a religion of blind belief. Ignorance is not bliss and does not lead to inner peace. In fact, Buddha urged his followers not to believe solely in the written words of some wise man, but to accept as true what you agree with using your own reason and experience, after thorough investigation. Regardless of whether you are a vegetarian or not, you should consider the indirect suffering involved in bringing meat, grains, fruits and vegetables to your table. </p>
<p> If we look beyond what we eat, we see that animals have been killed to provide leather for belts, shoes, handbags, couches, the oil for soaps we use and a thousand other products as well. It is impossible to live without, in some way, being indirectly responsible for the dead of some other beings. Every day, as you clean your kitchen or work in your garden, you are very likely to kill some insect that happens to get in the way. </p>
<p> As Buddhists, we should not be blind to these realities. How are we to realistically deal with this genuine problem? The point is not whether we can observe all the rules of morality all of the time. The point is that if the rules of morality are an appropriate way of carrying out principles of equality that are worth believing in, then it is our duty to follow these rules as much as we possibly can. It is indeed impossible to follow the rules of morality absolutely; but we should do our best to follow the rules of good conduct. If we want to live at peace with ourselves and others, then we must respect the life and welfare of all living things. </p>

<p> Can Catholics Eat Meat on Ash Wednesday? </p>
<p> Getty Pope Francis arrives to celebrate Ash Wednesday mass at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican on February 17, 2021. </p>
<p> Ash Wednesday is the beginning of the Lenten season. Catholics and some Protestant denominations observe Lent, which is a season for penance and reflection of sins in the weeks before Easter. </p>
<p> Catholics traditionally abstain from warm-blooded animal meat on Fridays during Lent. This obligation from the Church applies on Ash Wednesday as well. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to know: </p>
<p> Ash Wednesday Is an Obligatory Fasting Day for Catholic Adults & Teens </p>
<p> During this season of #conversion, let us renew our faith, draw from the “living water” of hope, and receive with open hearts the love of God, who makes us brothers and sisters in Christ. #Lenthttps://t.co/LA8HkEjcRv </p>
<p> In addition to the requirement to abstain from eating meat, Ash Wednesday is also an obligatory fasting day in the Catholic Church. But this doesn’t mean Catholics go hungry all day. Fasting rules are less stringent than the name would imply. </p>
<p> As explained by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Catholic adults and teenagers may eat only one full meal on Ash Wednesday. But Catholics may also eat “two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal.” Snacking isn’t allowed. </p>
<p> There is no limit on liquids consumed but the Church is referencing drinks such as water and juice. Drinking alcohol in excess on Ash Wednesday sort of misses the point of the day. </p>
<p> The fasting obligation applies to teenagers ages 14 and up and adults up to 59-years-old. But there are exceptions, as the USCCB explains: </p>
<p> Those that are excused from fast and abstinence outside the age limits include the physically or mentally ill including individuals suffering from chronic illnesses such as diabetes. Also excluded are pregnant or nursing women. In all cases, common sense should prevail, and ill persons should not further jeopardize their health by fasting. </p>
<p> Fasting, experienced as a form of self-denial, helps those who undertake it in simplicity of heart to rediscover God’s gift and to recognize that, created in his image and likeness, we find our fulfilment in him. In embracing the experience of poverty, those who fast make themselves poor with the poor and accumulate the treasure of a love both received and shared. In this way, fasting helps us to love God and our neighbour, inasmuch as love, as Saint Thomas Aquinas teaches, is a movement outwards that focuses our attention on others and considers them as one with ourselves (cf. Fratelli Tutti, 93). </p>
<p> Per the Catholic Faith, Jesus Christ Shed His Blood to Redeem Mankind & Abstaining From Meat Is a Symbolic Gesture to Honor That Sacrifice </p>

<p> The practice of abstaining on Fridays stems from the faith that Jesus Christ died on a Friday. As the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis detailed on its website, Catholics believe Jesus sacrificed his own flesh and blood to redeem mankind for our sins. Catholics don’t eat the meat of warm-blooded animals as a way to honor Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice and death on the cross. </p>
<p> As U.S. Catholic pointed out, it also made sense to abstain “from the shedding (and consuming) of blood” on the day that Jesus died on the cross. The publication wrote that “Friday, the sixth day, was also the day that God created animals, so abstaining from meat is a symbolic ‘stay of execution’ for cows, pigs, and sheep—just as the cross saves us from eternal death.” </p>
<p> The Catholic Church allows the consumption of fish on Fridays and on Ash Wednesday, although eating fish is not a requirement. Per the USCCB, “Abstinence laws consider that meat comes only from animals such as chickens, cows, sheep or pigs — all of which live on land. Birds are also considered meat.” Non-meat items such as eggs, milk and cheese are allowed. </p>
<p> Fish are classified as a “different category of animal” in the Catholic Church, as the USCCB explained. “Salt and freshwater species of fish, amphibians, reptiles, (cold-blooded animals) and shellfish are permitted.” </p>
<p> The Ashes Represent God’s Creation & Penance for Sins </p>
<p> Getty Worshippers pray during Ash Wednesday Mass at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels on February 26, 2020 in Los Angeles. </p>
<p> The coronavirus pandemic was expected to keep many Catholics at home on Ash Wednesday, as congregations continue to hold virtual services. But traditionally, it is common to see Catholics with ashes formed in the shape of a cross on their foreheads. It is an outward sign of repentance as Catholics embark on the Lenten season. </p>
<p> This tradition is meant to symbolize, per the faith, how God created mankind, as Catholic Online explained. On ash Wednesday, the priest or deacon states something similar to “For dust thou ‭art‭, and unto dust shalt thou return. Repent and believe in the Gospel.” The exact wording may be different based on the specific diocese but the “dust to dust” concept is universal. </p>
<p> This saying stems from the creation story of Adam and Eve in the bible. Again, the exact wording can vary based on the specific Bible edition but the meaning as written in Genesis is the same. Genesis 2:7 reads, “Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.” </p>
<p> But after Adam and Eve were tempted by Satan and ate from the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil,” God ejected them from the Garden of Eden. In the Catholic faith, Adam and Eve’s decision to disobey God and eat from the tree was the original sin. After their banishment, Adam and Eve had to work the land in order to eat. As explained in Genesis, God told Adam: </p>
<p> “Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.” </p>
<p> The Bible states that Eve’s specific punishment for the original sin was the pain of childbirth. </p>

<p> Can Cats Eat Fruit and Vegetables? </p>
<p> While it’s tempting to feed our cats the food that we love to eat, it’s probably not a good idea. You may love to eat apples and oranges, but your cats might not. While fruits and vegetables are generally safe for them to eat, there are certain foods that must be avoided by your feline friends at all costs. </p>
<p> Cats are hypercarnivores in nature. This means their digestive systems require a meat-based diet. Cats cannot properly digest plants, and it causes them several digestive issues such as vomiting, indigestion, constipation, and diarrhea. </p>
<p> But while they can’t really digest plants, they can still eat fruits and vegetables in moderation. Some fruits and veggies provide great nutrition for kitties and for this fact alone, it’s safe to feed them small quantities from time to time.So let’s get down to it. What are the fruits and vegetables that cats can eat, and what can’t they eat? </p>
<p> [Infographic] Vegetables & Fruits cats can eat! </p>
<p> Here are 13 fruits and vegetables that are safe for cats to eat, and 8 that must be avoided at all times. </p>
<p> Fruits and Vegetables that are Safe to Eat for Cats </p>
<p> 1. Apples </p>
<p> Cats can eat apples as long as you remove the peeling and the core. If you don’t remove the core, however, it can be dangerous to your cat. Why? Because apple seeds contain amygdalin, which is known to break down and produce toxic cyanide.While the cyanide content in apple seeds is too small of an amount to poison humans, they can be toxic to cats. So always make sure to cut the apple in slices and that the peel and core are out of the picture. </p>
<p> 2. Avocados </p>
<p> Cats can eat the flesh of the avocado but make sure you only feed her the flesh and nothing else. The leaves, skin, and bark of the avocado contain the oil-soluble compound persin, which is mildly toxic to cats. </p>
<p> 3. Banana </p>
<p> Bananas are safe for cats to eat. It’s also a great source of potassium, Vitamins B6, and Vitamin C. The high potassium content in bananas helps to support kidney and heart functions in cats.However, because bananas contain high amounts of sugar, you have to feed your cat in moderation. </p>
<p> 4. Beetroot </p>
<p> Beetroot is completely safe to eat for cats. However, beetroot can cause pigmentation of the urine and feces, which can resemble blood. If your cat is suffering from a urinary tract infection or suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, it’s best that you don’t feed her beetroot so you have a better gauge of whether or not their condition is becoming severe. </p>
<p> 5. Blueberries </p>
<p> Cats can eat blueberries and they’re a great source of vitamins and minerals. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants, potassium, and Vitamin C. It also helps in preventing tissue and cell damage, as well as reduce the chances of the development of urinary tract disease and infections. Plus, blueberries can improve your cat’s night vision capacity. </p>
<p> 6. Broccoli </p>
<p> Yes, cats can eat steamed broccoli and it’s a great source of fiber and protein. It also contains iron, potassium, calcium, selenium, magnesium, and a host of vitamins such as Vitamin A, B, C, E, and K. </p>
<p> 7. Cantaloupe </p>
<p> Cantaloupe is a safe fruit for cats to eat as long as you remove the skin. The skin may contain harmful bacteria and cause disease in your cat. Its anti-inflammatory properties are great for senior cats, and its vitamin content of Vitamins A, B, C, are great for added nutrition. </p>
<p> 8. Cranberries </p>
<p> Cats can eat cranberries and it’s a great fruit to fight infections of the urinary tract. It also contains manganese, fiber, and vitamin C. </p>
<p> 9. Mango </p>
<p> Mango is great for the cat’s digestive systems but make sure your cat does not ingest the pit as it contains cyanide, just like apples. Make sure when you feed your cat mango, it only contains the flesh. </p>
<p> 10. Pineapple </p>
<p> Pineapples are a great source of zinc and folate for cats. It promotes immune and digestive health, but since it’s a highly sugary fruit, always keep it to a minimum. Also, you need to ensure the spiky skin and hard core are not included when you feed your cat pineapple as they pose choking hazards. </p>
<p> 11. Raspberries </p>
<p> It’s okay for cats to eat raspberries and it’s great for its nutritional content. It has Vitamin C, high fiber content, and has anti-inflammatory features. However, raspberries contain a sweetener called xylitol, which can be fatal to cats when eaten in large amounts. Like pineapple, you have to make sure you keep it to a minimum. </p>
<p> 12. Strawberries </p>
<p> Yes, you can feed your cat strawberries. It promotes overall health, strengthens the immune system, and slows the process of aging. </p>
<p> 13. Watermelon </p>
<p> We all know that cats are not the biggest drinkers. This is why watermelon is a great fruit to help promote hydration in cats. Watermelon is composed of 90% water, as well as containing potassium, Vitamins B6, A, and C. It is also known to improve nerve and muscle function in cats. </p>
<p> Fruits and Vegetables that are Not Safe for Cats to Eat </p>
<p> So now that we’ve listed the fruits and vegetables that are safe for cats to eat, let’s begin our list of the fruits and veggies that your cat must not eat at all times. Let’s begin with the first on our list. </p>
<p> 1. Cherries </p>
<p> Cats should never eat cherries as they are highly toxic to them even when consumed in small quantities. </p>
<p> 2. Citrus Fruits </p>
<p> Cats don’t like the tangy flavor of citrus fruits. This includes lime, lemon, grapefruit, and even oranges. The oil in the peels of citrus fruits can cause serious reactions, but it also contains psoralens. Psoralens are mildly toxic to cats and can cause gastrointestinal issues. </p>
<p> 3. Figs </p>
<p> Figs are a no-no to cats as they are highly toxic and can even cause death even when cats consume small amounts. </p>
<p> 4. Grapes </p>
<p> Grapes can cause acute kidney failure in dogs and it’s far too great a risk to feed them to cats. </p>
<p> 5. Eggplants </p>
<p> While there isn’t so much information about whether or not eggplants are good or bad for cats, eggplants are a member of the nightshade family. Vegetables that belong to this plant family contain solanine, which is known to be toxic to cats. </p>
<p> 6. Potato </p>
<p> Potatoes are also members of the nightshade family and contain solanine. Potatoes with green on the skin contain the highest levels. While there’s not much information on potatoes, as well, it’s always better to be safe than sorry. </p>
<p> 7. Rhubarb </p>
<p> Rhubarb is a big no-no to cats. It’s toxic due to its soluble calcium oxalate crystal content. The highest amount is found on the leaves but they are also present in the stalks.Soluble calcium oxalate crystals are known to cause blood calcium levels to drop and in some cases, rhubarb can cause acute kidney failure in cats. </p>
<p> 8. Tomato </p>
<p> While ripe tomato is completely safe for cats to eat, green tomatoes are not. The leaves, stems, and green tomato contain solanine, which is toxic to cats and can cause gastrointestinal problems. </p>
<p> Can Your Cat Have a Vegetarian Diet? </p>
<p> The answer to this question is a big no! Cats need meat to survive. While vegetarian cat parents may feel heartbroken that they can’t let their cats go vegan or vegetarian, it is a must to them to eat meat on a regular basis.The nutritional needs of cats cannot be met with fruits and vegetables alone. If you are putting them on a vegetarian diet and they may seem okay now, in the long-run, they won’t be. A vegetarian diet for a cat is a death sentence.If you must feed your cat fruits and veggies, always make sure you follow these tips: </p>
<p> Make sure the peeling or skin, and seeds are removed to be on the safe side. </p>
<p> Always feed them in moderation. </p>
<p> The Bottom Line </p>
<p> While eating fruits and vegetables make humans healthy, it is not the best diet for cats as they are obligate carnivores and we have to respect this fact of nature. It is also a must that human food should not exceed 15% of a cat’s diet. So just because you love munching on grapes and raisins, doesn’t mean it’s safe for cats to eat.Make sure you do your research when it comes to feeding your cat so you ensure their health, and survival, too. </p>
<p> One of the best food for your cat would be wet food, because it contains all the necessary nutrients! </p>

<p> Can Dogs Eat Fish? </p>
<p> If you’ve ever walked down the dog food aisle of your local pet supply store, you’ve likely realized that fish is frequently on the menu for many canine companions. But can dogs eat fish? Don’t take the bait! Just because it is an ingredient in dog food does not necessarily mean that dogs can safely eat any type of fish that we could offer them. If you want to add fish to your dog’s diet, read this article first! </p>
<p> Dr. Jess describes the benefits and the risks of feeding fish to your dog, as well as which types of fish dogs can eat, and which are best left out of their bowl. </p>
<p> Dog food companies commonly use fish as one of their many ingredients. </p>
<p> However, dog food experts have arguments regarding the safety of serving fish to dogs. </p>
<p> Topics such as an increase in the risk of mercury poisoning, hypernatremia, as well as thiamine inactivation are a few of the concerns of many experts. </p>
<p> Well, is fish really a health threat to the dogs or are we overthinking this? Let me, the veterinarian, explain my thoughts… </p>
<p> It’s always best practice to double-check which foods your dog can and can not eat because many foods that are completely safe and healthy for humans are actually very risky for dogs to eat, or even poisonous or deadly to them. </p>
<p> That’s why I am so glad that you are here making an informed decision before feeding your dog this fish feast! </p>
<p> What Do Dogs Eat? </p>
<p> Some dogs aren’t too picky about what they eat. They’ll eat whatever you try to give them- they’re like vacuum cleaners sucking up anything put in front of them! </p>
<p> Some dogs are pickier than others. Pickier pups can be harder to properly feed because they just won’t swallow any food we try to give them. Try feeding a picky dog something like okra! </p>
<p> A common pet canine diet consists of a complete dry or wet feed and possibly supplements in some specific cases (not all pet dogs need supplements however). </p>
<p> There is also foraging if the dogs are allowed to roam or are feral, and of course there are treats! </p>
<p> The diet of every dog breed can very and is important to know when offering food to your dog. </p>
<p> An improper diet could put your dog at risk of having problems properly digesting their food and absorbing nutrients correctly. And we don’t want that now do we??? </p>
<p> So let’s talk specifically about fish and how it could affect your dog’s diet and overall health. </p>
<p> Fish Nutrition Basics: </p>
<p> Fish in general is low in fat, and high in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins (especially B vitamins) and important minerals. </p>
<p> Do Dogs Like Fish? </p>
<p> Dogs are natural carnivores. Most dogs like the taste of meat and meat products. </p>
<p> The flavor of fish is usually a delicious one for most dogs too. </p>
<p> So yes, most dogs like the taste of fish. </p>
<p> Can Fish Be Harmful to Dogs? </p>
<p> There is an ongoing debate about whether or not it is safe and okay for dogs to eat fish. </p>
<p> Some vets and pet nutritionists say that dogs can eat fish and be healthy and happy – no worries. Other pet experts say the opposite – they are against feeding fish to dogs. </p>
<p> Then there are even others who suggest feeding only small amounts of fish to dogs- it is okay every once in a while. </p>
<p> Before we can decide whether fish is safe to feed our dogs, we need to first understand some of the risks involved if we do feed our dogs fish. </p>
<p> There are 3 major reasons why many experts say that you should not feed your dog fish. These three big factors include: </p>
<p> Harmful Reason #1: High Mercury Levels </p>
<p> The #1 reason pet health experts have this fish debate is the research showing or suggesting high levels of mercury contained in some fish. </p>
<p> Certain fresh fish, such as tuna, king mackerel, and swordfish, have much higher levels of mercury than other types of fish, such as flounder, salmon, or tilapia. Skipjack and albacore tuna are the two tuna types that contain the least amount of mercury in the tuna family, so if you must feed tuna, look for one of those two varieties. </p>
<p> Why do certain fish contain so much mercury compared to other types of fish caught and sold for consumption? </p>
<p> Industrial pollutants, such as coal plants for instance, leak mercury, and that mercury then flows into lakes, rivers, and oceans. </p>
<p> Once in the water, it can be comsummed by the aqualife, and therefore can be seen accumulating in fish too. </p>
<p> The larger the fish and the older it lives to be, the higher the concentration of mercury in its tissues. </p>
<p> Tuna can live longer and have the potential to grow bigger in comparison to other edible fish, allowing for an increase in mercury levels to accumulate inside the fish’s meat. </p>
<p> If you feed your dog fish that contains mercury, there will be the potential for mercury poisoning, especially if fed large amounts for a long period of time. </p>
<p> Mercury poisoning can kill your dog if physical signs are not noticed and the pup is not treated quickly. </p>
<p> Symptoms of Mercury Poisoning in Dogs </p>
<p> Loss of coordination </p>
<p> Diarrhea (watery or bloody) </p>
<p> Harmful Reason #2: Parasites and Contamination </p>
<p> Just like when preparing fish to serve your human family, you should always properly cook the fish thoroughly before feeding it to your dog in order to avoid any issues with ingesting parasites. </p>
<p> Parasites commonly found in fish meat are normally killed by heat during the cooking process, which is the main reason why it is so important to properly cook your fish! </p>
<p> Harmful Reason #3: Thaminase and Vitamin B1 (and even salt!) </p>
<p> One big reason for many to be concerned about feeding dogs certain fish species like tuna, is the enzyme thiaminase. </p>
<p> Any raw fish, no matter what species of fish it is, contains an enzyme called ‘Thiaminase‘. </p>
<p> This enzyme is responsible for breaking down any thiamine (vitamin B1) your dog ingests, but if you properly cook the fish before eating it, the heat from cooking will make this enzyme useless in this regard. </p>
<p> Fish features another health threat for dogs due to it’s high concentration of another factor – sodium. </p>
<p> Many fish live in salty waters and their meat can absorb the salt (sodium chloride), meaning that much of the fish available to us to eat may be high in sodium. </p>
<p> Having a buildup of sodium in your dog can lead to them having hypernatremia (too high sodium concentrations), which can lead to serious illness. </p>
<p> That being said – one can of fish will not lead to this diagnosis! </p>
<p> Your dog would need large amounts over quite a long period of time to this this condition come to fruition. </p>
<p> Allergic Reaction to Fish: </p>
<p> A dog can develop an intolerance or an allergy to any food, so there is always the possibility that your dog is allergic to fish. </p>
<p> If you suspect your dog is allergic to fish do NOT feed fish to your dog. </p>
<p> If your dog is allergic to fish and accidentally ingests it, go to your nearest animal emergency room immediately. </p>
<p> Can Dogs Eat Fish? </p>
<p> Fish, given in small amounts periodically, is most likely just as healthy for your dog as it is for you. </p>
<p> Therefore, yes, dogs can eat fish. </p>
<p> Moderation is key; never go overboard when feeding fish for dogs. Small amounts every once in a while is okay for most dogs. </p>
<p> Dogs can have fish but only one or two times per week in small, controlled amounts. </p>
<p> Is Fish Beneficial For Dogs? </p>
<p> Fish has several health benefits for dogs, just as it does for humans, discussed earlier in this article. Some of the benefits for your dog include: </p>
<p> Fish is a great meat and protein source. </p>
<p> Not only does fish contains high levels of protein, but it contains high levels of healthy fats, minerals and vitamins too. </p>
<p> Fish is high in Omega-3 fatty acids which can help make your dog’s skin and coat silky, shiny, and smooth. </p>
<p> Fish is also extremely beneficial for overall development and function of many of the body’s systems due to the great source of many vitamins and minerals found within it. </p>
<p> Types of Fish Dogs Can Eat: </p>
<p> Fish types considered by many to be safer for dogs than tuna are the fish most commonly used in commercial dog foods – salmon, whitefish, herring, flounder, and Arctic char. </p>
<p> Typically, smaller, younger, wild-caught fish are generally safer options when considering adding fish to your dog’s diet. </p>
<p> Salmon: </p>
<p> Salmon is high in omega 3 fatty acids which may help to reduce inflammation in the body. Salmon also contains vitamin B12, selenium and is typically lower in heavy metals compared to other fish. Salmon is best if it is wild caught, as farmed salmon may contain chemicals. </p>
<p> Just do NOT feed your dog smoked salmon! Smoked salmon is not safe because the smoking process involves curing the fish in brine with salt, lots and lots of salt. That makes it too salty for dogs. </p>
<p> Other types of fish like salmon, for instance, feature the same nutritional benefits of tuna, but with a decreased risk of mercury poisoning. </p>
<p> Sardines: </p>
<p> Sardines are small and low on the food chain. They contain minimal amounts of mercury in comparison to larger fish, making them less of a toxin threat. </p>
<p> White Fish: </p>
<p> Lean fish like cod and haddock are a great source of protein and B vitamins. </p>
<p> Atlantic Mackerel: </p>
<p> A good source of omega-3 fatty acids, Atlantic mackerel is also lower in mercury than other types of mackerel like King Mackerel, so it’s safer for your dog to eat. </p>
<p> Can Dogs Eat Canned Fish? </p>
<p> Canned fish can be a healthy, protein-packed snack for your dog. </p>
<p> If feeding your pup canned fish, make sure to look for fish in water rather than oil, and if offering your dog the canned fish water, be sure that the fish does not have any added salt. </p>
<p> Look for the phrase “no salt added” on the can’s packaging just to be sure. </p>
<p> Can Dogs Eat Raw Fish? </p>
<p> Can dogs have tuna that hasn’t been cooked or isn’t canned? </p>
<p> Hard no. Not only should dogs not eat raw fish but your canine friend should not eat any type of raw fish or seafood. </p>
<p> Raw fish is definitely not the safest choice. </p>
<p> Raw fish can carry bacteria and parasites that may be damaging to the body once consumed. </p>
<p> Also remember that raw fish contains the enzyme thiaminase, and enzyme that can inactivate thiamin (vitamin B1) in your dog’s body. </p>
<p> Cooking fish takes care of this issue, destroying the thiaminase. </p>
<p> Your pup will likely love his fish treat no matter what form it comes in so better to be safe and only serve them cooked fish if any at all! </p>
<p> Can Dogs Eat Breaded or Battered Fish? Can Dogs Eat Fish Sticks? </p>
<p> Unnatural, greasy coatings definitely aren’t safe for your dog to be ingesting. Stick to fresh varieties of fish from the fish counter of your grocery store, and don’t try slipping your pup any fish sticks. </p>
<p> How to Serve Fish to Dogs: </p>
<p> As convenient as it might be to just let your dog have fish, that’s not the safest option for your pup. </p>
<p> Keep the following in mind when serving fish to your dog: </p>
<p> When buying dog food like canned fish, remember to buy the water-based cans of tuna (not fish in oil!) without additional flavorings or seasonings. </p>
<p> Try to find a fish that has lower potential for increased mercury levels to avoid any chance of mercury poisoning. </p>
<p> Make sure to properly cook the fish to eliminate any parasites and harmful bacteria that may be present. </p>
<p> You can try to steep the fish in water overnight to get rid of as much salt as possible before cooking and serving it to your dog. </p>
<p> Using fresh fish? Feed cooked fish to your dog with it first deboned. Dogs aren’t great with bones and the bones can end up lodged in their air passage and present as a choking hazard for them. </p>
<p> Do not add salt or seasonings to the fish. Your dog will love the fish just fine without any additives that could cause them more harm than good. </p>
<p> Introduce fish small amounts at a time. It’s definitely a good idea to take it slowly. Give your pup a little at a time and wait to see how they react to the treat before proceeding with giving them another bite or two. </p>
<p> And remember that dogs need more than a bowl or plate of fish – they need a complete and balanced diet. </p>
<p> Whichever food you choose for your dog, whether it is fish or another protein source, fresh meat or store-bought kibble, it needs to have the AAFCO label indicating the diet is complete and balanced for your dog’s life stage. </p>
<p> AAFCO approved foods have gone through testing and compliance to make sure that the diet is safe and healthy for your pet. </p>
<p> Dogs already get everything that they need from their kibble or canned food. </p>
<p> How Much Fish Can My Dog Have? </p>
<p> Can dogs eat fish? As I mentioned previously, it depends… </p>
<p> Small amounts of cooked or canned fish don’t contain enough mercury to cause a problem in your dog if given periodically. </p>
<p> Adult dogs should not eat cooked or canned fish more than once or twice a week, in small amounts. </p>
<p> There is a big difference between feeding your dog fish occasionally as a treat and making it a staple part of their diet. Treat fish as a every-one-in-a-while special treat. </p>
<p> It’s always better to be safe than sorry! </p>
<p> Too much of a good thing can be an issue. Too much fish can lead to obesity and other health problems. </p>
<p> Talk to your vet about the appropriate serving size of fish for your dog, ESPECIALLY if you plan to feed fish as a regular part of their diet. </p>
<p> Can Puppies Eat Fish? </p>
<p> I would never advise a puppy owner to feed this fish to their puppy. No way. </p>
<p> Your pup’s first months of life should consist of specialized puppy diets approved by your local veterinarian upon puppy exam. </p>
<p> Seafood Takeaway: </p>
<p> Dogs are carnivores that really love to hold true to that label! </p>
<p> They LOVE meat! Fish, a meat that is commonly consumed by humans is naturally drool-worthy to our canine companions. </p>
<p> Allowing your pet to have a bite or two of cooked or canned (in water) fish without seasonings, oil, flavorings, or bones, given every once in a while is okay. </p>
<p> Giving your dog a fishy treat every once in a while will not give them mercury poisoning or the other health issues that were discussed throughout this article. </p>
<p> If you are concerned about feeding your pet dog a fish snack or you feel that the fish that they have already snacked on didn’t go well, contact your veterinarian for more guidance on what to do next. </p>

<p> Can Geckos Eat Fruit? [Important Considerations For Owners] </p>
<p> Fruit is a readily available food and you may consider offering your gecko some as a treat, but it’s important to ask if it’s safe for them to eat. One of the most common inquiries from gecko owners is regarding their diet. So I have decided to conduct some thorough research into the topic in which I will be sharing with you here today. </p>
<p> So, can geckos eat fruit? Some species of gecko do eat fruits as well as insects. These are known as Frugivorous species; and enjoy fruits such as grapes, apples and apricots. The most common species kept as pets include crested and day geckos. Other species, like leopard and African fat-tailed are exclusively insectivorous. If you want to feed fruit to your gecko, you must make sure that your pet is one of the species that can feed safely on it. </p>
<p> Geckos, like most lizards, are predators and enjoy a varied diet of insects. While they make excellent pets, you must know how to feed a gecko before bringing one home. </p>
<p> Let us now take a closer look at the topic so that you can get a better understanding as to how to best look after your lizard. </p>
<p> Do Geckos Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> The particular species, age, and activity level of your gecko will determine the type of diet that you should feed. </p>
<p> Most gecko species prefer a diet of juicy live insects and would never care to eat fruit; whereas other are known as frugivorous species whom love and do well when consuming fruit. </p>
<p> Below, we will take a look at some of the most common species of gecko that can and do consume fruit. </p>
<p> What Species of Gecko Can Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> The crested and day geckos are the most popular fruit consuming species, among a few others. </p>
<p> Crested geckos can eat fruit several times during the week in addition to their staple diet of insects. They like mashed fruit like bananas, peaches, and nectarines. </p>
<p> Day geckos mostly eat insects but occasionally eat tropical fruits like mango, papaya, and even fruit baby food. </p>
<p> Both species also benefit from supplemental multivitamins, vitamin D3, and calcium powder. This ensures that their diet is nutritionally complete. </p>
<p> What Species of Gecko Cannot Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> Many other commonly kept species, such as leopard geckos and African fat-tailed geckos are mostly if not entirely insectivorous. </p>
<p> This means that they eat a diet entirely of insects. If you are to own one of these species, you should not look to feed fruit to them. There is no benefit in doing so, and in some cases, can prove problematic. </p>
<p> What Fruits Can Geckos Eat? </p>
<p> Before feeding fruits to your pet gecko, make sure that you carefully prepare the fruit by mashing it up or putting it in a blender. You can also chop up fruits into small pieces. </p>
<p> Be sure to only provide a small serving at a time. This is because geckos lack the dentition and strength in their jaws to bite into solid food. </p>
<p> You’ll also want to consider the fruits that you are offering. Certain fruits have poor nutritional content and can even be imbalanced for the needs of your gecko; making them ill. So, not all fruits are safe and you should choose fruit wisely. </p>
<p> One of the main considerations as a gecko owner is the calcium to phosphorous ratio. </p>
<p> Your gecko’s food must have twice as much calcium as it does phosphorus. The calcium to phosphorus ratio is something every pet owner must be aware of as it can affect your gecko’s health. </p>
<p> Fruits like banana, nectarine, and peach have inadequate calcium to phosphorus ratio and should only be given in moderation. </p>
<p> Make sure that you wash all fruit thoroughly before offering it. You must make sure that you remove as much pesticide residue and bacteria as possible. If possible, always opt for fresh organic fruits. </p>
<p> Separate parts of the fruit that are toxic and inedible such as the pits and seeds – this includes fruits like apples, cherries, peaches, pears, and apricots. </p>
<p> For smaller geckos, consider grating fruit and cutting it into pieces no bigger than space in between your gecko’s eyes. </p>
<p> Here are some example of the best and most suitable fruit to offer your gecko. They are more balanced in terms of calcium/phosphorous and are generally easier for them to consume: </p>
<p> Berries – these include raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. </p>
<p> Pitted fruits – these include apples, pears, and cherries. </p>
<p> Tropical fruits – these include figs, pineapples, and papayas. </p>
<p> Other fruits – these include melons, persimmons, and grapes. </p>
<p> As previously mentioned, just ensure all pits and seeds are removed and fruit is mashed up or broken down into easily consumed sized chunks. </p>
<p> What Kind Of Food Do Geckos Eat? </p>
<p> All geckos, whether they eat fruit or not, like to eat live insects. </p>
<p> Geckos don’t thrive eating prepared foods, so you must purchase or breed live insects for your gecko. </p>
<p> You must feed your gecko a wide variety of different insects, and do not rely on one type of insect as your gecko will lack all of the nutrition that they need. </p>
<p> Suitable insects to feed your gecko include: </p>
<p> Crickets – crickets are usually at the core of most pet gecko diets. They are not necessarily the healthiest, but they are some of the easiest to breed and purchase. </p>
<p> Mealworms – mealworms are often too large for many pet geckos; however, they are the staple diet for leopard geckos. </p>
<p> Flies – flies are ideal for small geckos, and fruit flies are often the easiest to locate for purchase. </p>
<p> Waxworms and Superworms – these insects are very rich and calorie dense. They should only be offered no more than once a week as a special treat. </p>
<p> Most gecko owners will find purchasing live insects troublesome, as it often requires frequent trips to the pet store. </p>
<p> Thankfully, you can get various different types of live insects on Amazon for great prices that are ideal for geckos. Here are the best ones available: </p>
<p> When and How Much Food to Feed Your Gecko </p>
<p> Because most geckos are nocturnal, it is best to feed them at night to guarantee they will be awake during meal times. </p>
<p> Young geckos must eat every day, whereas adult geckos only need to eat every other day. Geckos need to have continuous access to clean water. </p>
<p> The amount of food to offer your gecko depends on their age and activity level. </p>
<p> You must avoid putting too many insects into your gecko’s cage as they can escape, die, and will eventually rot; leading to the growth of bacteria and germs. </p>
<p> Introduce bugs one or two at a time. Feed your pet as much as they are willing to eat; they should eat with enthusiasm within the first few minutes. </p>
<p> As your gecko’s enthusiasm for food begins to dwindle, reduce the amount you give them, looking for the moment when they want to stop eating entirely. </p>
<p> Some geckos will eat from long tweezers, so this could be an option for controlling the number of insects you feed your gecko. </p>
<p> Make sure to clear away all uneaten insects and fruit after your gecko has eaten. Both insects and fruit rot, which can create an unsanitary environment for your pet. </p>
<p> Finally </p>
<p> Some frugivorous species of gecko eat fruit. The best fruits to offer include berries, stone fruits (without the pits/seeds) and some tropical fruits. However, you should be sure to offer small amounts at a time and offer them broken up for your gecko to safely and easily eat. </p>
<p> Whether a gecko is frugivorous or not, all species eat insects and need variety in their diet. </p>
<p> Sometimes geckos can stop eating, which is a worry for any owner; but thankfully there are adjustments that you can make before rushing your gecko to the vet. Usually, a gecko refusing to eat is an indicator that something else is wrong. </p>
<p> If a gecko is too cold, they might stop eating. It could be a simple matter of the heat bulb being burned out or the heat pad not working – these are issues are an easy fix through simple replacing. </p>
<p> Secondly, if a gecko’s metabolic rate drops below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, they will automatically stop eating. Geckos need their environment to be at around 80 degrees Fahrenheit to eat well and be healthy. </p>
<p> If you suspect your gecko has an illness, then you must take your gecko to the vet at the earliest opportunity. Aside from this, be sure to clean out and optimize their enclosure. </p>
<p> Many diseases can prevent your lizard from eating, and in some circumstances getting immediate medical attention is the only way to rectify this issue. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, purchase plenty of live and nutritious insects, and some of the recommended fruits (if you own a frugivorous species) and you’ll gecko should live a long and happy life in your care. </p>
<p> Related Questions </p>
<p> Can geckos eat bananas? While frugivorous spies of gecko can safely eat banana, it has a very poor calcium-to-phosphorus ratio so you should feed this fruit rarely, if at all. If you decide to do so, be sure to blend and mash it up so that you gecko can easily consume it. </p>

<p> Can Giant Pandas Eat Meat or Small Animals? </p>
<p> 7 </p>
<p> Shares </p>
<p> We know of pandas today because they are cute animals that eat bamboo shoots all day long. But that’s not the entire truth. Though we can see and symbolize bamboos as the primary diet source of pandas, in actuality, they have a digestive system similar to that of a wolf or wild boar. </p>
<p> But did you know if they eat anything else besides bamboo? And can giant pandas really eat meat? </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> Do Pandas Eat Meat? </p>
<p> Yes, they do! Hopefully, you have now gotten used to the fact that our cuddly and on the verge of extinction bears are not always bamboo and leaf-eating. </p>
<p> BBC reported something very out of the ordinary earlier this decade in 2011. They had reported seeing a wild panda gnaw on the remains of a dead animal. </p>
<p> This animal was gnu, which is a type of wild cow. The scientists from the Wanglong Nature Preserve observed this behavior and recorded these wild pandas found in China’s Sichuan Province. </p>
<p> More or less, 1 percent of the panda population eats meat. The digestive system of pandas is such that they can easily digest meat. </p>
<p> They resemble the digestive system of those known to eat meat, such as wolves and other carnivores. Yet Pandas possess such a unique digestive track that effectively digest grass and other leafy green substances. </p>
<p> Looking at Pandas and their biology theoretically, pandas should only be able to eat meat. Because even after thousands and millions of years of evolution from carnivores to herbivores, their inner system fundamentally digests meat and proteins. </p>
<p> In some recent studies, researchers found that pandas were all meat-eating about 2.4 million years ago. Then they had shifted to consuming 24-86 pounds of bamboo a day. </p>
<p> I know, right! That’s a lot! But because these GIANT bears only rely on bamboos to live, it’s completely understandable. </p>
<p> What Kind of Meat Do Pandas Eat? </p>
<p> Pandas ate what any other carnivore ate – that is cows, goats, and other animals. Even now, 1 percent of the pandas’ diet allows them to eat small animals in emergency and need times. </p>
<p> Scientists have found that until 5000 years ago, pandas have a very varied diet. They ate meat yet also had a diverse vegetative diet. </p>
<p> Pandas, in short, can eat any meat they want, but that’s it. They do not want to eat meat. </p>
<p> Why Did Pandas Stop Eating Meat? </p>
<p> In 2010, a party of scientists from the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department from the University of Michigan made some discoveries. </p>
<p> This discovery let us know about the reason behind this shift from meat to bamboo shoots. </p>
<p> While trying to stay away from technical terms, the scientists said that mutation occurred in the pandas’ T1R1 gene into a pseudogene. </p>
<p> This mutation leads to a difference in flavor pickup of pandas. Those bears cannot taste the distinct umami taste of meat and therefore did not prefer to eat them anymore and lost all interest in it. </p>
<p> Why Are Pandas Considered Carnivores? </p>
<p> In simple terms, the giant panda’s digestive system more closely resembles a carnivore. They could eat small animals as part of their calorie intake – it’s just that they prefer not to. </p>
<p> And though pandas are very similar to carnivorous animals like lions, they have a unique bacterium in their stomach called Clostridium. </p>
<p> This bacterium has digestive enzymes that break the sugars into simpler sugars. </p>
<p> What usually happens is that when a carnivorous animal eats plants, it cannot digest them properly. That’s why you’ll never see a lion eating leaves or grass. </p>
<p> On the other hand, Plants have cellulose, which gets broken down into energy by the body. This way, plants are digested by Pandas. </p>
<p> When Do pandas Eat Meat? </p>
<p> Rarely, today. But there can be times when you can see pandas getting their hands dirty and munching on some animals. </p>
<p> You will see wild pandas more prone to doing this, but you won’t see those cuddle bears holding their stomachs in pain later, either. </p>
<p> Being herbivores with a carnivorous digestive system, Pandas still require proteins. Bamboo shoots are a form of protein for Pandas. </p>
<p> But since bamboo shoots provide very little nutrition, pandas eat about 12-38 kg every day. They must do this to get a fulfilling, nutritious meal. </p>
<p> How Many Types of Pandas Are There, and How Many Eat Meat? </p>
<p> As far as humans are aware, we have three types of Pandas. </p>
<p> The Red Panda </p>
<p> The Giant Panda </p>
<p> The Regular White and Black Panda </p>
<p> Do Red Pandas Eat Meat? </p>
<p> Yes, but the latest ones are vegetarians with different diet patterns. </p>
<p> The Red Panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a species closely related to raccoons. These bears spend a lot of their time on trees and can be found by people mainly in China, Nepal, and Bhutan. </p>
<p> Red Pandas live in the eastern Himalayas. Though red Pandas mainly eat small insects and vegetation, they also have the same ancestors as other animals eating Pandas. </p>
<p> The Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is unfortunately on the verge of extinction and is rarely seen by people anywhere. </p>
<p> They are present in the temperate forests of the high mountains of southwest China. These Giant Pandas are similar to the red pandas and can also eat meat along with bamboos and leaves. These Pandas are the most famous and rare ones. </p>
<p> The often found red and white pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis) are the most commonly found species of Pandas. They are mainly found in the secluded mountainous regions of central China and the provinces Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu Provinces. </p>
<p> These Pandas, like the other two, are also meat-eating species yet vegetarians. </p>
<p> Therefore, we can see that all these subspecies had the same ancestors. These ancestors, before the mutation, ate meat and lived on it. After millions of years, now though they can eat meat, they are vegetarians with a varied diet. </p>
<p> Do baby Pandas eat meat? </p>
<p> No, they don’t. The baby pandas mostly rely on their mother’s milk for food and protection for as long as a period of six months. </p>
<p> Their mothers feed them and take care of them like a normal baby. However, they start eating bamboo, leaves, stems, and shoots to fulfill their fiber requirements. </p>
<p> They do not begin to feed on the meat as long as they are approximately one year old. </p>
<p> How Often Are Pandas Eating Meat? </p>
<p> Not very often. Pandas are somewhat like humans in this regard. Like how vegetarians chose not to eat meat, they intake those proteins from other sources such as tuna, beans, and some particular greens. </p>
<p> Pandas are consummate vegetarians and belong to the Carnivora group of mammals. </p>
<p> They are Carnivora because, like other dogs, cats, weasels, hyenas, mongooses, and other similar animals, Pandas also can eat meat. But since their diet mostly consists of bamboo shoots, roots, and leaves, they are called vegetarians. Or so it seems outwardly to us. </p>
<p> Do Pandas Eat Small Animals? </p>
<p> Yes, they do! We are aware our cute and adorable Pandas can and do eat meat. </p>
<p> We did not know that these Carnivora also eat fish along with small animals such as lizards and insects, etc. Fish also have much nutritional value in them, such as proteins and antioxidants. </p>
<p> Do Pandas Eat or Attack Humans? </p>
<p> No, they don’t. Pandas, any species of them, are not violent by nature. They are calm and friendly creatures that keep to themselves mostly. </p>
<p> They prefer most of their time in solitude and in mountainous areas where there are many trees. Pandas often spend all their days eating, lazing around, and sleeping. They are not very active and aggressive. </p>
<p> But despite their preference for solitude and lazing, they are the subject of adoration and study of many people and scientists, respectively. </p>
<p> Because of this, Pandas are always in the eyes of humans. The Panda bears are significantly less in number. </p>
<p> There are only somewhat 2000 or more pandas left in the world. We know that we mainly find them in China, but China has an ever-growing population and industrial sector due to which land is continuously being developed by the Chinese government. </p>
<p> This process is causing significant damage to the habitat of Pandas. They are forced to evacuate and are lessening in number over the years. </p>
<p> Pandas usually are not aggressive or a danger to humans. That is until you provoke them. You can make a Panda attack you if you irritate them enough. </p>
<p> If they are not provoked or made angry, Pandas won’t do anything out of the ordinary. </p>
<p> So, it would be best if you didn’t irritate a Panda when you see one. Chances are, it’ll attack you. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Natures, all animals are exceptional and unique in their ways. But Pandas are very special due to their extreme cuteness, adorable behavior, and general appearance. </p>
<p> Pandas are endangered and can go extinct very soon if they keep reducing at the current rate. Pandas’ eating habits are distinguishable from most animals as they have a carnivorous digestive system but digest all cellulose and depend heavily on bamboo. </p>
<p> They had ancestors who ate meat, and evolution made them into vegetarians. </p>

<p> Can Leopard Geckos Eat Fruit?: What not to feed them </p>
<p> Leopard geckos are adorable and one of the best reptiles that you can keep. It is a perfect pet for beginners, and you will not go wrong once you keep them in the right environment with nutritious food. Can leopard geckos eat fruit? Let’s find out! </p>
<p> Leopard geckos are insectivorous animals and will eat any insect that moves in front of them. However, you should avoid overfeeding or giving them the wrong type of food to avoid serious health consequences. </p>
<p> You may be wondering if leopard geckos can eat any other food source apart from common bugs. In this article, you will learn more about whether leopard geckos can eat fruit and what type of food is suitable. </p>

<p> Can Leopard Geckos Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> To address your concern on fruit feeding for your leopard gecko, we firstly need to know: can leopard geckos eat fruit? </p>
<p> Leopard geckos are known as insectivores and they cannot eat fruits or vegetables. Some people show that leopard geckos can eat some fruit. But as long time reptile owners, nobody recommends you feed leopard geckos fruits. </p>
<p> The main reason why many believed that leopard geckos can’t eat fruit is that their bodies are not designed to digest the fruit. Leopard geckos do not have a functioning caecum, which helps digest cellulose, the nutrient found in fruit and vegetables. </p>
<p> They also have a shorter and alkaline digestive tract. In comparison, herbivore animals have a longer and acidic digestive tract. </p>
<p> Many believed they don’t eat fruit because their skull and jaw have evolved (small and less robust) to eat meat. It is unlikely that fruit will do your gecko any good, and if you find your gecko eating fruit, it is because the food is available for them. </p>
<p> It is best if you stick to an insect diet for your leopard geckos to digest them naturally. </p>
<p> Can All Leopard Geckos Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> Although leopard geckos can eat fruits if readily available, it will not be beneficial to their body. In captivity, you can feed your leopard geckos with a varied diet of commercially available insects like crickets, roaches, mealworms, etc. </p>
<p> You can then gut-load the insect feeder with fruits and vegetables at least 24 hours before you feed your gecko. If you plan on giving your geckos with fruit, ensure that you carefully prepare the fruit by mashing it or blending it. You can also chop the fruit into small pieces before you give your gecko. </p>
<p> Ensure you wash the fruit thoroughly before you offer your gecko. You will also need to separate parts of the fruit that are inedible or toxic like pits and seeds. </p>
<p> This will help to remove pesticide residue and bacteria that can be on the fruit. Furthermore, ensure that you provide them with small serving at a time. This is mainly because they lack dentition and do not have the jaw strength to bite into solid food. </p>
<p> What Fruits Can Geckos Eat? </p>
<p> Before feeding your geckos with fruit, you will need to consider the nutritional content of the fruit. Some fruits can make the needs of your gecko imbalanced and will make them ill. This is why you need to consider the calcium to phosphorus ratio of the fruit before you give your geckos. </p>
<p> Your geckos need twice as much calcium than phosphorus. You will need to give them fruits with twice as much calcium as phosphorus. </p>
<p> Fruits That Leopard Can Geckos Eat </p>
<p> Although leopard geckos will not eat any fruit or vegetable, it can try out some types of fruit. Here are some examples of the best fruits that you can offer your gecko. </p>
<p> Pitted fruits: pears, apples, and cherries, and so on. </p>
<p> Grapes, </p>
<p> Melons, etc. </p>
<p> Note: the best fruit for your gecko must have balanced calcium to phosphorus ratio. </p>
<p> Fruits That Leopard Geckos Cannot Eat </p>
<p> You should avoid feeding your leopard gecko with fruits that contain dangerous compounds that can be toxic to them. You should avoid feeding them with rhubarb, starfruit, and avocado. </p>
<p> You can also avoid fruits like nectarine, banana, or peach or give them in moderation. This is because they have inadequate calcium to phosphorus ratio. </p>
<p> How Often Can You Feed Leopard Geckos With Fruits? </p>
<p> It is best to feed your leopard geckos only as a treat, whether they are hatchling or adult. This is because fruits do not have nutritional benefits to your gecko. </p>
<p> However, you can gut load insect feeders with fruit 24 hours before you feed your gecko. You just have to ensure that the insect is not bigger than the space between your gecko eyes. Furthermore, you can feed hatchling leopard geckos every day while juveniles and adults can eat every other day. </p>
<p> Leopard geckos are crepuscular, and the best time to feed them is around dawn or dusks. The amount of food to feed your gecko should be the ones it can eagerly eat within a few minutes. </p>
<p> This means you don’t need to put too many insects in their cage as they can escape, die, or even make your gecko overeat. </p>
<p> Once your gecko is done eating, ensure you clear out the uneaten insects. This is because leftover insects can rot or even nimble your gecko and cause stress. </p>
<p> Offering Fruit </p>
<p> When offering fruit to geckos, ensure you wash the fruit before you give your pet. This helps to remove bacteria and pesticide residues on the fruit. Separate the inedible or toxic parts like pits and seeds from the fruits. </p>
<p> Always ensure that the fruit is prepared in a way that your pet can easily eat it. You can use a food processor to make the fruit. And if you do not have one, you can simply cut the food into tiny parts with a knife or shred with a grater. </p>
<p> Note: Ensure that the fruit you offer them is soft, and their dimension should not be longer than the dimension between your geckos’ eyes. </p>
<p> Wrapping Up </p>
<p> Although leopard geckos do not eat fruit, some geckos can eat fruits. However, you should avoid feeding your leopard gecko with fruit because fruits comprise high sugar and acid. </p>
<p> You should know that leopard geckos do not like fruit taste and will only take it when starving or needs more moisture. </p>

<p> Can Spiders Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> Can Spiders Eat Fruit? Probably they can </p>
<p> In the world, there are so many species of animals that we can call fructivores, or those that can enjoy the flavor of a fruit juice or the entire fruit itself as their main food to sustain their lives’ requirements of nutrients and energy. </p>
<p> Fruits are the way from some angiosperms (or plants with flowers that produce seeds) to multiply and reproduce, but they also can be part of some animals’ diet. The edible ones could also give many nutrients and could be great for hydration because of their high content of water in them. </p>
<p> So, you may be asking: But can spiders eat fruit? After all, they are also animals that are omnivores (the ones that can eat almost anything) Let’s see with some question and if they are, in fact, able to eat fruit like some other species of animals, or if they are only strictly hunter that eat meat. </p>
<p> Do spiders eat veggies? </p>
<p> It was a known fact that most (if not all) species of our arachnid friends only just eat meat (or at least the juices inside the said prey), but it was discovered fairly recently that some species of spiders do eat veggies. </p>
<p> A study from some universities from the UK, Switzerland and the United States discovered that some species of spiders do eat veggies, and the species mostly found eating greens are the jumping spiders. </p>
<p> The biggest group that likes a veggie meal once in a while is Salticidae, a family of jumping spiders with over 5,000 species spread across the entire world, characterized by the pair of big, shiny eyes at the front of their heads. Salticidae accounted for 60 percent of the documented plant-eating incidents. </p>
<p> One of the investigators said in an interview that “The ability of spiders to derive nutrients from plants is broadening the food base of these animals; this might be a survival mechanism helping spiders to stay alive during periods when insects are scarce”. Additionally, “diversifying their diet with plant is advantageous from a nutritional point of view, since diet mixing is optimizing nutrient intake.” </p>
<p> However, when it comes to what the plants can offer to the nature, like leaves, flowers and fruits, could be a little be different in if spiders can eat fruits, or leaves, or whatever. </p>
<p> Although, there is one type of spiders from Mexico and other countries of Central America which feeding is based mostly (if not only) of an herbivorous diet. This is a species of jumping spider and it is know to be the only one to have this kind of diet. </p>
<p> Do spiders eat leaves? </p>
<p> Mostly in what the above investigation says, some species of spiders do eat leaves from time to time. </p>
<p> Although this is a behavior in some species of spiders, that alone does not say that spiders actually chew and nibble the leaves as toothed animals or herbivores would do. </p>
<p> What spiders can do with leaves, pollen and other parts of the plant is to extract the juice from them or, in the case of some of those particles getting caught in their webs, the possibility of being eaten while the spider starts to eat their own webs. </p>
<p> That last behavior alone can actually provide with some good nutrients like calories from the pollen getting stuck in the web. And because the spiders are actually good recycler creatures, they can eat their own webs to get some energy and nutrients back. </p>
<p> Do spiders eat fruit? </p>
<p> When someone asks: Can spiders eat fruit? The answer would be around the: “No, they can’t. They are carnivores” and while the answer is mostly right, it can be more complex than a simple no. So, do spiders eat fruit? </p>
<p> In short answer: No. They do not eat fruit. In a more elaborate way: No, because it is not like they can chew the fruit like most animals would do, but they probably can suck the internal juice from a fruit, just like some species of spiders would do while extracting nectar from some flowers or the sap from a particular tree… Or even the liquids from an insect, toads, birds or fish, as they commonly do. </p>
<p> So, basically, the spiders can’t chew the pulp of a fruit and digest it normally like others animals would do, though they could get the juice from inside those fruits to get hydrated or to get more nutrients and energy. </p>
<p> In the world exists a well-known species of spiders that mostly (if not entirely) have a diet that is based of just vegetarian food. It is the Bagheera kiplingi, a species of spiders which diet is basically vegetarian only, being the only one in the entire world that is know to have a marked herbivorous diet. </p>
<p> For the Bagheera kiplingi spiders, the Beltian bodies are a delight. They would try to avoid fights to ants guarding said Beltian bodies, that are rich in lipids, sugars and proteins. The spiders mostly feed from these parts of the acacia’s trees and, from time to time, also consume nectar and occasionally steal ant larvae from passing worker ants for food, meaning that they are not totally herbivores but also carnivores. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> When talking about if spiders can eat fruit, the answer is a simple no. But that does not mean the spiders can’t get some nutrients from these or other parts of a plant, without actually nibbing or chewing said parts. </p>
<p> Spiders are mostly known to be carnivorous meaning they would mostly eat meat from animals like insects, toads, birds and fish (the last three are almost incredible to believe, but some species can actually catch fish!) but there is an exception of this rule. </p>
<p> The Bagheera kiplingi is a species of spider that is mostly found in Central America, in countries like Mexico and Guatemala, where those little spiders can have a diet mostly herbivorous. They eat from the Beltian bodies from the leaves of the acacia trees, while trying to avoid confrontation and disturbance of the ants that make some type of symbiosis with those parts of the tree. </p>

<p> Can You Eat Fish Eyes? (Shocking Truth!) </p>
<p> Yes, you can cook fish eyes. Many different cultures around the world use fish eyes as a regular ingredient in their meals. Cooking fish eyes isn’t much different than cooking the whole fish. You can cook fish eyes on their own or keep them as part of the fish head. When you scoop out fish eyes to eat, make sure to get the muscles underneath the eye for added texture and flavor. </p>
<p> Eating Fish Eyes </p>
<p> There are many different parts of animals and see lights that a human being should not eat. But it may surprise you when we tell you that fishes are not one of them. Many cultures around the world eat fishes and serve them as their dish. As long as the eyes are appropriately prepared and cooked thoroughly, no one should experience any gastrointestinal issues. The main reason many people don’t eat fish eyes originates from their own squeamishness or because they are allergic to fish. </p>
<p> The most common cultures that consume fish eyes as a regular part of their cuisine is most of southeast Asia and the ocean and beach regions of Central America and South America. Many Slavic cultures that border an ocean or have lakes also use fish eyes in many dishes. </p>
<p> How to Prepare Fish Eyes for Eating </p>
<p> However, if you are used to American Cuisine, then you will not find many recipes for fish eyes. You will have to go to other countries and other culture’s recipes to find ways to cook fish eyes and make them more delicious. </p>
<p> There are two main ways you can cook fish eyes. You can cook fish eyes by leaving them within the fish and cooking it, or you can remove the eyes and cook them on their own. Either way is acceptable, but each method has its own steps. </p>
<p> Cooking Fish Eyes </p>
<p> You can use the same methods you usually perform to cook fish in order to cook fish eyes. If you use a sauce, be sure to place a generous amount of sauce over and underneath the eyes. The methods you can use while cooking an entire fish are </p>
<p> Sauteing </p>
<p> Frying </p>
<p> Boiling </p>
<p> Eating Fish Eyes </p>
<p> If you’re not one for grilling or deep frying, then adding fish eyes to a traditionally thick French sauce might be the way for you to get used to them. A few articles online state that fish eyes have a gelling agent inside them. When they are cooked with creamy sauces and spices, the liquid begins to turn thick. This may be a great way to experiment with a new ingredient in a traditional sauce you are familiar with. You can also add in pasta. We recommend that you start with a cream-based sauce, so the fish eyes will be more acceptable to your palette. </p>
<p> Benefits of Eating Fish Eyes </p>
<p> Reduce Waste </p>
<p> You may not think that throwing away fish eyes is a waste, but actually, they’re edible. If food is edible, that means that not eating it is technically wasting it. It is not like the guts or bones of a fish. Fish eyes can be adapted to any recipe. </p>
<p> Culture </p>
<p> Very few Western cultures eat fish eyes. It is often seen as low class or third world to eat parts of a fish or other animals that are unsavory. But this is only due to the culture of the West. Hispanic and Latino cultures, Asian cultures, and Slavic cultures use fish eyes as an ingredient in one or more of their dishes. </p>
<p> Delicious </p>
<p> When we think of food as delicious and savory, people usually dream up images of salmon sprinkle with lemon herbs or shrimp cocktails, pounds and pounds of Ceviche, guacamole, and chips. Very few people think officious in a stewed broth as delicious. If you cook fish eyes in a spiced broth, the eyes will easily absorb the flavor or salt around it. Plus, the muscle behind the eye also captures the flavor and adds different textures. I know it may be difficult to get used to the idea of fish eyes as a part of your food, but try out this part of the fish in a broth or sauce, and you’ll realize what you have been missing. </p>
<p> What Else to Know About When Eating Fish Eyes </p>
<p> Since human beings started fishing and catching fish to supplement their meals, there have been countless myths about eating different parts of the fish. Many of these myths include the eyes. Although we have dispelled many of them, there is one that always gets around even to this day. It is the myth that eating fish eyes will improve the quality and vision of your own eyes. This is not true or found in any scientific study. If there was any truth to it, it would be because fish eyes have minerals and vitamins that help maintain your vision. It does not mean that eating fish eyes add extra “eye compounds” to your ocular region. It is the same type of myth that involved carrots in World War II. </p>
<p> Don’t Eat Just the Eye </p>
<p> When you may think of consuming fish eyes, you’ll probably only consider the eyeball as the only part of the eye. However, there is an entire ocular system filled with nerves and muscles that are parts of the eyeball as well. When you prepare your first fish eyeball recipe, you should not leave out these extra outside parts. Many people state that if you only scoop out the eyeball and nothing else, your recipe will be quite bland and unappetizing. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> If you are looking to eat the more unsavory parts of an animal, fish eyes might be the mildest introduction to your journey. You can consume the eyes in a sauce or leave them inside the fish head while you broil, grill, or fry it in a pan. And don’t forget to eat the muscle underneath! </p>

<p> Can You Eat Fish Scales? </p>
<p> Learning about fishing can be very interesting and a lot of fun. It’s an exciting feeling to catch your own food. There’s quite a bit of work involved after catching a fish to get it ready for your dinner plate. </p>
<p> If you’re looking to cut back on that work, you may be wondering “can you eat fish scales”? The short answer to the question is yes, you can. You can safely eat the fish scales without causing any harm to yourself. That doesn’t mean you would want to though. The fish scales do have some minerals and healthy fats in them. </p>
<p> Don’t let his bit of healthy knowledge encourage you to leave those scales on. If you eat the fish with the scales removed your body will still get a healthy dosage of these minerals and fats. </p>
<p> What is Eating Fish Scales Like? </p>
<p> If you’re thinking about skipping a step of cleaning that fish up for dinner and leaving the scales on, then you are not about to have a treat. Think about what it’s like eating popcorn when a piece of kernel gets stuck in your teeth. Pretty annoying, right? </p>
<p> Just imagine every bite of popcorn you took has around 7 or 8 kernels in it. That is what eating fish scales is like. Getting one popcorn kernel stuck between your teeth is irritating enough. Can you imagine sitting through a meal where something hard was getting stuck in your teeth with every bite? </p>
<p> If you are ever preparing fish for a date night then you can understand why it’s important to remove all of those scales. </p>
<p> Types of Fish Scales </p>
<p> Interestingly enough, there are 4 different types of fish scales. Each type of fish scale is different in its chemical composition as well as it’s size. Some fish scales are a little bit healthier than others. Let’s take a look at the 4 different types of fish scales. </p>
<p> Placoid </p>
<p> Placoid scales are usually flattened rectangular shapes. They can be found on sharks and rays. These scales don’t change in size as the fish grows. New scales grow in to fill up the empty space. </p>
<p> Cosmoid </p>
<p> Cosmoid scales are very similar to placoid scales in shape and size. They are usually found on fossil fish as well as lungfish. These strong scales consist of two layers of bone, a layer of dentine, and a final layer of vitrodentine. This is not a scale that would be fun to bite down on. </p>
<p> Ganoid </p>
<p> Ganoid scales take on the shape of a rhomboid and articulating peg and socket joints in between them. These can be found on a wide variety of fish such as sturgeons, bowfin, and paddlefish just to name a few. </p>
<p> Cycloid ; Ctenoid </p>
<p> The cycloid and ctenoid scales are the most common type of scales found on bony fish. These scales have greater flexibility than the other ones because the anterior part of the scales is overlapped by the posterior part of the scale in the front. </p>
<p> Nutritional Properties of Fish Scales </p>
<p> As unappetizing as it sounds, there are still some great nutritional properties of fish scales. If you really want to eat them then you may as well learn about what makes them good for you. </p>
<p> Collagen </p>
<p> Fish scales have a healthy dosage of collagen in them. Collagen is great for helping to improve ligaments, and bones, as well as supporting joints. Adding more sources of collagen to your diet can help you achieve softer skin and stronger hair and nails. So, maybe fish scales can help make you prettier. </p>
<p> Extra Omega-3 and Other Healthy Fats </p>
<p> One of the most common reasons people add fish to their diets is because fish is loaded with healthy fats, especially omega-3 fatty acids. Eating fish with the scales still on is just a way to get even more of these healthy fats into your body. Omega-3 fatty acids are a great way to help build healthy brain cells, keep your heart healthy, and prevent a stroke from happening. </p>
<p> Okay, so maybe there are some great nutritional properties to fish scales. They also seem like they could help fix a lot of beauty issues naturally. So, is there a more appetizing way to eat fish scales? </p>
<p> Fish Scale Jelly </p>
<p> We couldn’t talk about all the wonderful things fish sales can do for your body without introducing a more appetizing way of eating them. If you would like an easy way to add more collagen to your diet then consider putting this healthy jelly on your crackers. </p>
<p> Simmer for a few hours until the scales have dissolved </p>
<p> Once dissolved, filter the fish scales </p>
<p> Add dried longan </p>
<p> Cook for an additional 30 mins </p>
<p> Pour into a jelly mold and allow it to cool in the fridge for 4 or more hours. </p>
<p> If you don’t plan to consume the whole batch of jelly within 7 days, then make sure you freeze what you don’t eat to avoid waste. Don’t worry, the process of making this jelly (and the results) don’t have a stink fish smell to it. That is why this jelly is a much more pleasant way to get your collagen fix from fish scales. </p>
<p> Final Verdict: Can You Eat Fish Scales? </p>
<p> Yes, fish scales are edible. That doesn’t mean you’re going to want to eat them though. Imagine trying to have a nice conversation at dinnertime with fish scales finding room in your teeth upon every bite? That doesn’t sound like a very appetizing dinner. </p>
<p> Fish scales do have a lot of nutritional benefits to them. If you are looking for a way to naturally add more collagen and healthy fats to your diet then consider trying the fish scale jelly recipe as a much tastier alternative to eating scales left on the fish. </p>

<doc id="file21599777" filename="can-you-eat-fish-scales-what-you-need-to-know" parent_folder="web2" url="https://dinnercaptain.com/can-you-eat-fish-scales-what-you-need-to-know/">
<p> Can You Eat Fish Scales? What You Need to Know </p>
<p> Can You Eat Fish Scales? The brief answer is yes, you can. Although, I do not recommend it. Fish scales are safe to eat as long as you are eating fish scales right away without injuring your mouth or throat. They must be cooked very well before eating. And they are not tasty and do not provide much nutritional value. </p>
<p> There are five types of fish scales – Cosmoid, Placoi, Cycloid, Ganoid, and Ctenoid. Cycloid and Ctenoid types of scales can be found on the majority of our regular types of fish with bones that we eat. Sharks and sturgeons, in contrast, have placoid types. </p>
<p> I was surprised to find out that the fish scales have healthy fats and certain minerals that are beneficial to our body. However, just because of this fact, do not leave all fish scales on when cooking or eating fish. </p>
<p> Fish without scales is excellent too with a good sufficient dose of fats and minerals. Plus, fish scales are very small, and the amount of good stuff in them just does not necessarily justify eating them. </p>
<p> Can you eat fish scales? </p>
<p> Yes, you can eat fish scales as they are generally edible and nutritious on their small scale. However, eating them right and the right size and right amount is equally essential. </p>
<p> Fish scales are embedded with some nutrients. If you really wish to add in healthy fats and more collagen by eating them, then try making tasty fish scale included recipes. I would not. </p>
<p> If you are thinking you should eat the fish scales this time for dinner then, it is not a treat. It would be somewhat like eating popcorn with stuck kernels in your teeth. It could be very annoying. Eating fish scales feels like eating the softened outer shell of sunflower seeds. </p>
<p> Some of the fish scales that are left after some good descaling can still serve the purpose since the fish by itself has good nutrients. When you can eat the remaining scales without hurting your mouth then yes, you can eat fish scales as they will eventually digest. </p>
<p> Just do not indulge yourself with large amounts of fish scales in your food for fear of hurting your digestive tract. Remember – you are NOT a cat! </p>
<p> Some nutritional advantages of fish scales: </p>
<p> Though quote unappetizing, fish scales offer some nutritional benefits. Eating them will give you the benefit of eating them. </p>
<p> Provides collagen – Fish scales have a small dose of collagen which is ideal for improving bones, ligaments, and joints. Adding your meal with collagen sources will assist in getting stronger hair, nails, and soft skin. Therefore, fish scales make you more pretty. But, man, you would have to eat a lot of them, which is not good for you. </p>
<p> Omega-3 and healthy fats – Several individuals add fish to their lunch or dinner to load healthy fats into their diet. This is particularly true for omega-3 fatty acids. To eat fish scales means consuming a little bit more omega-3 and other healthy fats to assist in the building of health to heart, brain cells and avoiding an occurrence of a stroke. </p>
<p> Beauty – they provide a little bit more elasticity and suppleness to your skin. Your skin becomes beautiful naturally. But again, I would rather stick with fish meat for that. </p>
<p> Can you eat fish scales on salmon? </p>
<p> Yes, it is safe to eat fish scales on salmon and its skin. In fact, you can eat salmon fish scales more nicely than scales from some other types of fish. Salmon fish scales are loaded with all the good staff present in salmon fish. </p>
<p> Eating skin and scales each time to get benefits is recommended by some. While others might not like eating the scales from a view of fine dining. It is not fine dining – when you eat fish scales – it is very exotic food. </p>
<p> By the way, I am not necessarily talking about fish skin here. </p>
<p> Let us distinguish between fish skin and fish scales. Fish scales sit on top of fish skin. Eating wild salmon with skin is quite healthy and I love it sometimes. You will not be able to notice the scale when salmon skin is well baked. In fact, well-baked salmon skin is crispy and tasty. The other varieties of salmon with scales you can easily eat are pink, sockeye, Atlantic, chinook, and coho. </p>
<p> Since the scales are not so pleasant to eat, they are often descaled prior to cooking. Owing to its tough texture, people often discard it. They are however safe to eat. Just like salmon meat itself, its skin with scales is very nutritious with omega-3 fatty acids. </p>
<p> Can you eat cooked fish scales? </p>
<p> Yes, it is fine to eat cooked fish scales, however, they are not pleasant or tasty to eat. You can prepare some tasty dishes by cooking fish with scales or fish scales into other dishes. So, you can eat cooked fish scales depending on how you cook them. </p>
<p> Note, that the more you cook fish scales, the more easily you can eat them. Longer cooking makes them softer. Long cooking, especially boiling or simmering, can totally disintegrate fish scales with water to make a liquid or jelly. </p>
<p> You can grill the fish by kiting or butterflying by splitting them but not slicing them into 2 different halves or pieces. They are called so, due to their appearance after splitting. This way you eliminate fish bones while there is no need to remove fish scales. </p>
<p> You can grill this fish either on the open flame or using aluminum foil. People often prefer the latter for cleaner food. This way the tougher scales burn while tender ones are not. They remain on the skin. This way even the fish flesh is protected. </p>
<p> You can scrape off the burnt scales off leaving the rest on the skin. </p>
<p> Add a little seasoning with little olive oil to enjoy the natural flavor of the fish. </p>
<p> This is one good way of enjoying the fish scales and taking in the benefit as well without any harm done to the throat or mouth. </p>
<p> Can you eat fish skin with scales on it? </p>
<p> Yes, as I mentioned, you can eat fish skin with scales as long as it is properly cleaned. Fish scales can be edible and so is the fish skin. Salmon is the best, in my opinion. Just note that cooking fish with its skin on takes longer no matter which method you use – grilling, baking, frying, or steaming. </p>
<p> Note: If you want to cook fish skin with scales on it, make sure you do it thoroughly, as long cooking disintegrates the scales. For example, grilling on low fire instead of high, but for a long time. </p>
<p> Baking or simmering on medium or low for hours may make scales very soft, to the point that they essentially melt with skin. Then you can eat fish skin with scales on it more safely. </p>
<p> Few tips on how to cook fish skin with scales </p>
<p> As mentioned in the previous section, grilling is one of the good ways of eating fish with scales after cooked. Baking too. </p>
<p> You can add in garlic, herbs, cilantro, parsley, onions, and other aromatics to season the grilled fish. </p>
<p> Add in a coat of barbeque sauce over the fish before grilling. </p>
<p> Cook the fish and then add in different sauces by cutting smaller pieces of the grilled fish. </p>
<p> One other way of cooking fish with scales is by popping the fish scales by pushing them with your thumb. Essentially, this is deep frying in oil on a pan. </p>
<p> Heat the oil to 350-400 deg F and then place the fish into the oil. </p>
<p> The fish scales puff up and crackle. You can check the fish being cooked using a cake tester. Use snapper or a sea bream to make these crispy fish scales. </p>
<p> Another way recommended is to bake the fish with its scales on and bake it well. </p>
<p> All the above processes protect fish flesh from high heat. </p>
<p> Tip: tiny fish scales are usually more eatable than large fish scales. Some fish, like Atlantic char, has tiny and eatable fish scales. </p>
<p> What happens if you eat fish scales? </p>
<p> Nothing, if you cooked skin well and if you are careful and eat just a little bit of them. You can eat fish scales provided you are supposed to eat them without hurting yourself. However, eating fish scales can be unpleasant. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Eating fish scales is one’s personal choice. However, eating fish scales is safe and fish scales have only a little bit of nutrients and healthy fats in them. Cooking them appropriately and eating the tender ones is one good way to enjoy them. </p>
<p> On the other hand, I personally do not eat fish scales as it is not quite on our regular human menu. Cats, for example, do a much better job digesting fish scales. </p>
<p> Still, if you want to shock your friends with the super-exotic meal, then fish scales will do it. Just cook them very well, or you may lose your friendship. Just saying. </p>

<p> 8 Causes of Tired After Eating (No.6-8 Deadly) </p>
<p> √ Scientific Checked Pass quality checked by advisor, read our quality control guidelance for more info </p>
<p> Post author Scientific review: Dr Heben's Team </p>
<p> Have you ever felt so drowsy and tired after eating? Most people had this experience and sometimes this phenomenon makes people become little bit concerns about their health conditions. People tend to afraid that they are suffering from specific diseases and they ended up asking questions like “Why am I tired after eating?”. </p>
<p> For many people, feeling tired after eating, especially after they get their lunch, could be very disturbing since it will affect your productivity throughout the day. The most common thing on why people tend to feel tired after eating is related to food that you consume. The tiredness after eating is a form of reaction from your body to types of food you are consuming. Some experts say the tiredness after eating is a normal condition. But, when you can’t keep your eyes open and just want to sleep so bad no matter what you eat, you should be more concerns about your health since it could be a signal for health problems. In this article, you will find the causes on why you feel so tired after eating. </p>
<p> Tired after Eating is a Normal Condition </p>
<p> In most cases, the tiredness that you feel after eating a food is a normal situation. Everybody will experience this thing. Here are some explanations on why feeling tired after having a meal is a normal condition. </p>
<p> Body Reactions Against Food That You Eat </p>
<p> This is the most ideal explanation on why you always feel tired after having a meal. You just feel tired because of your body reacts to the food that you already just ate. After you consume sweet or bakery products, that’s pretty normal if you feel tired afterwards. Food that has a great amount of sugar causes your brain to release high amounts of neurotransmitter and serotonin hormone, which will make people tend to fall asleep. </p>
<p> Besides, eating bakery products that contain flour will also make the blood sugar rise higher than normal. This thing will stimulate your pancreas to release great amounts of insulin, which will transports protein blocks called tryptophan from the bloodstream to your brain, then it will convert into serotonin that will make you feel tired and sleepy. </p>
<p> Digestive System Take Over Your Body’s Energy </p>
<p> This is one of the possibilities on why you feel tired after eating. Digestive organs like small intestine and large intestine requires high amounts of energy so they can work properly. After you have some meals, your body needs to digest lots amount of calories from your food. To digest this high amount of calories, your brain will shifts your body’s energy to focus on digestive systems. This will releases the red blood cells over to break down the food and transport its nutrients into your body. </p>
<p> Because your body’s attention is fully focused on digestion, the rest of your body tends to relax. This is why you feel tired and drowsy after having a meal. You might also feel tired after eating spicy foods. Your body needs to spend huge amounts of energy to digest spicy food. Also, spicy food will metabolize a chemical called capsaicin, which will make you feel tired. </p>
<p> Side Effects of High Amounts of Carbohydrate That You Just Consume </p>
<p> After you consume food with high amount of carbohydrate such as rice, potatoes, or bread, you might feel drowsy afterwards. Consuming foods with high-glycemic index carbohydrates will release high amounts of insulin, which will help to store the sugar you just consumed as glycogen. This would have advance effects on dropping your sugar level, which without a doubt will make you feel tired, drowsy, and sluggish. So, if you want to suppress the possibility of tiredness after eating, you should consider low-carbohydrate food to decrease the amount of carbohydrate in the body. </p>
<p> Effects on Over-Stressed </p>
<p> This is one of the possibilities on normal condition why you always feel tired after eating food. It is simply just because you are mentally tired and stressed. The tiredness because over-stressed can cause an “energy draining”, which will make you become more tired than before. Unlike the other three reasons as mentioned above, this possibility doesn’t relate to the digestive system, so all you can do is just relax and rest a little while. </p>
<p> You’re Not Exercise Enough </p>
<p> If you think that stay inactive or just sit throughout the day will help you to maintain your energy, well you’re wrong. On the contrary, staying active throughout the day will help you to reduce the possibilities of feeling tired after having a meal. In fact staying active all the day would help you to get a better sleep in the night and stay alert during the day. </p>
<p> Tired After Eating Could be a Sign of Health Problems </p>
<p> While most of the common reason on why you feel tired after eating is because your body reaction to food that you just ate, there are also some concerns regarding your health when you are always feeling tired after having a meal, no matter what food you are consuming. </p>
<p> These are the signs that could happen to you associated with tiredness after meal. If these signs occur, you might have some problems related to your health problems. </p>
<p> Nutrient Deficiencies </p>
<p> Everyone of you who evidence undigested food in your feces might have nutrient deficiencies problems. Nutrient deficiency is a condition where your body is unable to process the nutrients from the food you just ate. As the results, you wouldn’t gain any energy from your food after having a meal, which will make you feel tired and sleepy. </p>
<p> Diabetes </p>
<p> Diabetes is a kind of condition when your body couldn’t produce insulin properly. As diabetics, your body is unable to produce insulin which is really important to regulate your blood sugar level, either to stored it as glycogen, or transform it into glucose which will boost your energy. When your blood sugar doesn’t store as glycogen or transformed as glucose, of course your blood sugar level will increase suddenly, which will lead to headache, dizziness, and fatigue. </p>
<p> Food Allergies and Food Intolerance </p>
<p> For everyone of you who feel so tired after having some meals, and then follows up by many symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, or any allergic reactions, you should avoid the same food next time you have some meals as you could be allergic and have intolerance to certain ingredients in that food. </p>
<p> How to Prevents the Tiredness after Eating </p>
<p> After you know the reason on why you always feel tired after eating, we recommend you to consider these tips so you avoided from tiredness after eating. </p>
<p> You Need to Ask Yourself About Your Eating Habits </p>
<p> First of all you need to evaluate your eating habits, either you frequently like to eat food on a higher portion or in a lower portion. It is very important because the quantity of your meal will decide what will you feel afterwards. If you eat large portions of unhealthy food, you will be more likely to feel tired afterwards. However, if you forced to consume unhealthy foods, just try to reduce the size of your portion. </p>
<p> Eat Less </p>
<p> This is the follow up from the point 1. It is better to eat at a small portion, but more frequently rather than huge portions at once. A large portion of meals means that your body needs more energy to digest it. You could balance the small portion of your meals with “mid-snacks”, so you will get calories that you need throughout the day. Take a notice that you must take meals every 3 hours. </p>
<p> Eat Healthy Snacks </p>
<p> As already mentioned above, you should take mid-snacks in between your main meals schedule. But you are not recommended to consume snacks with high amount of sugar or carbs. Snack like fruit is best choice to maintain the energy level of your body and get rid of the feeling of tiredness after eating. </p>
<p> Eat a high complex-carbohydrate and high protein </p>
<p> Instead of eating junk food, you should consider your food carefully. Make sure that the food that you would like to eat contains complex carbohydrate and also high protein. Here is the example of foods you should choose because of its nutrients. </p>
<p> Any kind of vegetables, including tomatoes, cabbage, sprouts, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, onions, etc. </p>
<p> Any kind of fruits </p>
<p> Green beans </p>
<p> Mushrooms </p>
<p> Whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, whole wheat crackers, brown rice </p>
<p> Choose mineral water rather than coffee or alcohol </p>
<p> Sometimes, make a glass of beer or coffee is more tempting, rather than consuming mineral water, but don’t do that if you don’t want to feel tired after eating. Although coffee is widely known to make you stay alert, coffee can make you become addicted to caffeine, and it is not a good thing. Meanwhile, consuming alcohol is also not a good thing because alcohol is sedative, so after you consume a glass of beer, it would not be a surprise if you become more tired than before. Consuming mineral water is the best choice since this beverage will keep you hydrated troughout the day. </p>
<p> Stay Active After You Eating </p>
<p> After eating, you should keep yourself active during the day, don’t just sit down in the same place for hours. It is always a good idea to have some exercises, even the most simple one like walking on your way home, use stairs instead of elevators, or do some stretches in your office. Just make sure that you keep yourself moving since it will help you to get proper blood flowing and get rid of tired feeling. </p>
<p> In summary, feeling sleepy and tired after eating is a common condition, and it should be because it is your brain that convert your body’s energy to digest all of calories from food that you just ate. Meanwhile, you can prevent and reduce the feeling of tiredness and sleepiness by consuming healthy food with smaller portions, alongside apply the tips that we already provided above. Stay healthy! </p>

<p> What to Eat When You Have Clostridium Difficile (C. Diff) </p>
<p> Dietary Recommendations for Better Management </p>
<p> Sherry Christiansen is a medical writer with a healthcare background. She has worked in the hospital setting and collaborated on Alzheimer's research. </p>
<p> Lindsey Waldman, MD, RD, is a board-certified pediatrician and pediatric endocrinologist. </p>
<p> The infectious bacteria Clostridium difficile (C. diff) produces an inflammation of the colon and severe diarrhea. This highly-contagious organism primarily impacts people over age 65, particularly those who are taking antibiotics and are in the hospital or living in a facility such as a senior care center. </p>
<p> In some instances, C. diff symptoms are mild, but it still may be passed to others easily. The primary goal of the C diff diet is to eat foods and take supplements that help alleviate the primary symptom, which is diarrhea. </p>
<p> Benefits </p>
<p> Although there is limited research on the effectiveness of diet for alleviating symptoms of C. diff, researchers know quite a bit about foods that worsen and those that alleviate diarrhea. When it comes to those at high risk of getting C. diff due to antibiotic use, foods and supplements that have probiotics have been found to be effective. </p>
<p> In fact, in a 2018 study of adults and children who were taking antibiotics and co-administered a probiotic supplement, there was a lower risk of Clostridium difficile infections.﻿﻿ The study authors concluded that “Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a lower risk of C. difficile infection.” </p>
<p> C. diff bacteria multiply when the normal (good) bacteria in the gut is suppressed—such as when antibiotics are taken. Probiotics may reduce the risk of developing C. diff.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Administration of probiotics is a logical treatment modality, but the studies show mixed evidence that specific probiotics, such as Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus species, speed up recovery of C. diff. ﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Another benefit of the C. diff diet is that it offers easy to digest foods, as well as those that have soluble fiber. There are basically two types of fiber, soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fiber may worsen symptoms of diarrhea. Soluble fiber is thought to help flush the C. diff bacteria out of the body. </p>
<p> Soluble fiber is contained in foods such as oats and barley (foods that absorb water and become sticky when wet). Insoluble fiber comes from foods such as celery and apple peels; when these foods are placed in water, they do not absorb the water and do not change form. </p>
<p> People with C. diff should consult with their healthcare provider, nutritionist, or another medical professional before taking any type of supplements, including probiotics or fiber supplements. Some digestive problems worsen with fiber supplements. </p>
<p> How It Works </p>
<p> Antibiotics are known to destroy the good "friendly" bacteria in the gut. Friendly bacteria are instrumental in fighting off infections in the colon, such as C diff. Foods that replace the good bacteria in the gut—such as fermented foods and those with probiotics and probiotic supplements—are thought to help alleviate symptoms of C. diff (such as diarrhea). </p>
<p> A soft diet (with foods that are easy to chew and swallow) that includes soluble fiber while avoiding foods high insoluble fiber (such as nuts and seeds) may help promote digestion. But there is a lack of definitive evidence from medical research studies to prove the best type of diet.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Duration </p>
<p> The C. diff diet should be implemented until your healthcare provider gives the all clear that the condition has resolved. The diet may be continued after a bout of C. diff as a prevention measure to keep the bacteria from re-growing and the condition from recurring. </p>
<p> Once your registered dietitian or another healthcare provider gives the order to discontinue the diet, it may be important to gradually start adding back the foods you were once accustomed to, rather than drastically changing the diet all at once. This gives your digestive system adequate time to adjust to foods that are relatively new. </p>
<p> It is not uncommon for those who contract C. diff to get the disease more than once, therefore, it’s important to take steps to prevent the disease once a person heals from C. diff. </p>
<p> According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, “The most important thing to introduce into your diet are “friendly bacteria”, often called probiotics, that will help repopulate your gut and crowd out the potential for regrowth of the C. diff bacteria.” </p>
<p> What to Eat </p>
<p> The C. diff diet is comprised of foods that help to alleviate or lessen diarrhea. Initially, your healthcare provider may recommend a diet of clear fluids, but this diet can only be implemented safely for a few days. It may take up to two weeks for a bout of C. diff to respond to treatment and for diarrhea to clear up. </p>
<p> In the interim, while waiting for treatment to be effective, many people with C. diff eat a diet of foods that won’t exacerbate (worsen) symptoms, but that may help lessen the severity of diarrhea. Your healthcare provider and a registered dietitian will recommend the exact eating plan. </p>
<p> Compliant Foods </p>
<p> Fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut, tempeh (fermented soybeans), miso (fermented soybean paste) </p>
<p> Foods high in soluble fiber </p>
<p> Vegetables (non-cruciferous) cooked into soups or mixed into smoothies (such as green beans, zucchinis, and cucumbers) </p>
<p> Lean protein sources (such as turkey, chicken, and eggs) </p>
<p> Oats, oat bran, oatmeal, rice bran </p>
<p> Barley </p>
<p> Bananas </p>
<p> Natural applesauce (no added sugar) </p>
<p> Fruits such as citrus fruits, melons, peaches, cherries, strawberries, and watermelon </p>
<p> Lentils, beans </p>
<p> Low fiber cereal (such as Rice Krispies) </p>
<p> Finely ground flaxseeds (not whole) </p>
<p> Starchy, easy to digest foods, like potatoes, noodles, crackers and white rice </p>
<p> Lots of water and liquids to replenish water loss from diarrhea (such as soup and soup broth) </p>
<p> Non-Compliant Foods </p>
<p> Foods high in insoluble fiber </p>
<p> Cruciferous vegetables (such as cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and broccoli), turnips, beets, carrots, cabbage </p>
<p> Unnatural oils (such as margarine, Olean, or Olestra) </p>
<p> Nuts and seeds (including nut butter) </p>
<p> Unpeeled apples, blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries </p>
<p> Prunes, prune juice, dates </p>
<p> Sugar substitutes like sorbitol and xylitol </p>
<p> Large amounts of sweet foods, such as cakes and cookies (the sugar and fat may worsen diarrhea) </p>
<p> Peas (have both soluble and insoluble fiber, but may be best to avoid due to insoluble fiber content) </p>
<p> Caffeine </p>
<p> Friendly (Good) Bacteria </p>
<p> It’s important to eat foods that contain probiotics to replenish the gut with good bacteria for those with C.diff, particularly if antibiotics have been taken long-term. A 2018 review study found that using probiotics helped to reduce diarrhea in those with C. diff, without any side effects. </p>
<p> Probiotics can be found in certain foods, such as those that are fermented, including yogurt, kefir and more. It’s important to ensure that the fermented food products do, in fact, contain live cultures. Probiotic-rich foods such as yogurt and kefir should not contain sugar—because sugar promotes the growth of bad bacteria in the gut. </p>
<p> An over-the-counter or prescription probiotic supplement may be beneficial. But be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before taking any type of supplements. </p>
<p> A combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and other species in a dosage of more than 10 billion colony forming units, taken each day, may be effective. </p>
<p> Soluble/Fermentable Fiber </p>
<p> Studies have shown that eating a diet high in soluble fiber may help to eliminate C. diff. (and other types of bacterial infections in the bowel) sooner than a diet high in insoluble fiber. Foods that contain soluble fiber include oats, oat bran, oatmeal, beans, strawberries, apple pulp, and citrus fruit. </p>
<p> Some experts recommend taking banana flakes (available in a supplemental form) to prevent diarrhea. Bananas have pectin (a soluble fiber), which may help to slow the emptying of the gut and decrease the urgency/frequency of diarrhea. </p>
<p> Banana flakes can be purchased at a local pharmacy, but it’s important to consult with your healthcare provider before taking banana flakes, or any other type of natural supplements, particularly for those with C. diff. </p>
<p> Avoiding Insoluble Fiber </p>
<p> Foods that contain insoluble fiber include nuts, seeds, apple skin, wheat, wheat bran, barley, beets, carrots, cabbage, and cruciferous vegetables. These should be avoided. </p>
<p> Recommended Timing </p>
<p> Eating small amounts of foods and fluids frequently throughout the day is recommended for those on the C. diff diet. Large meals or snacks may increase diarrhea stools. </p>
<p> Cooking Tips </p>
<p> Very hot and very cold liquids and foods increase the frequency of diarrhea; drinking fluids at room temperature may help to control diarrhea. But everyone’s body is different, so experimenting with the temperature of foods and fluids may be needed to find out what works best. </p>
<p> Cooking vegetables until they are soft may lower the fiber content. Steaming or boiling, for example, can destroy much of the fiber content, as will deep-frying many foods. </p>
<p> Pureeing foods and processing them in a blender to make smoothies is not known to significantly lower the fiber content. However, using a juice extractor (which removes the pulp) will dramatically lower the fiber content in most foods. </p>
<p> Removing the peel from foods (such as apples) will reduce the fiber level, making foods high in insoluble fiber easier to digest and more suitable for the C. diff diet. </p>
<p> When cooking, it’s important to try to avoid using cooking oil whenever possible. </p>
<p> Modifications </p>
<p> An excessive amount of fluid may be lost when a person has chronic diarrhea. Along with the water, some nutrients and electrolytes are lost. Examples of modifications that may need to be made on the C. diff diet include: </p>
<p> Drink plenty of fluids (at least eight to 10 glasses of water per day). </p>
<p> Avoid caffeinated beverages (which can increase dehydration). </p>
<p> Replace lost potassium. Eat foods high in potassium such as bananas, boiled potatoes, and more. </p>
<p> Replace lost sodium. Drink bouillon soup, broths, tomato juice, and orange juice. Eat salty foods such as pretzels and cheese. </p>
<p> Replace lost calcium. Drink and eat plenty of dairy products if tolerated. If lactose intolerant, include almond milk, soy milk, and other milk replacements. </p>
<p> It’s important to drink small amounts (such as a half of a cup) of fluids frequently throughout the day instead of gulping large amounts of water). Drink fluids throughout the day; do not wait to feel thirsty. </p>
<p> Tips for getting extra fluids include eating/drinking plenty of: </p>
<p> Avoid taking salt pills and always consult with your healthcare provider to inquire about the need for potassium supplements. </p>
<p> Considerations </p>
<p> A long-term C. diff diet is not recommended because the foods may not supply enough of the nutrients needed on a long-term basis. Also, malabsorption of nutrients is a common side effect of C. diff. It’s important to receive close medical intervention to ensure levels of sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium are normal. </p>
<p> Look for foods high in these nutrients and follow your healthcare provider’s instructions closely on when to start back on a normal diet to ensure adequate nutritional intake. </p>
<p> Dietary Restrictions </p>
<p> Whole milk and whole milk products are known to cause stomach upset; a person who has C. diff is more likely to have trouble digesting lactose. Using a milk substitute (such as oat milk) may be recommended. Other tips for substituting milk products on the C. diff diet include: </p>
<p> Eat/drink smaller amounts of milk products at a time. </p>
<p> Eat low lactose dairy such as yogurts that contain live active cultures are low in lactose. </p>
<p> Select cheeses such as mozzarella, swiss, feta, and parmesan cheese. </p>
<p> Try enzymes that help with digestion of lactose (after consulting with your healthcare provider). </p>
<p> A Word From Verywell </p>
<p> Having a condition such as C. diff can be very challenging. Consulting with a professional registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) may be helpful. To find a registered dietitian near you, a nationwide search can be done online at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ online referral service. </p>

<p> 10 Celebrities Who Only Eat Fish </p>
<p> These celebrities chose to go meatless but became pescatarians to add protein and healthy fats into their diets. </p>
<p> Many celebrities choose a vegan or vegetarian diet because of their stance against eating meat or because they believe a plant-based diet is better for their health. While many stars forgo meat for good, some include fish in their vegetarian diets for added health benefits. </p>
<p> Pescatarians don't eat meat, but they do eat fish. These celebrities chose to go meatless but became pescatarians to add protein and healthy fats into their diets. They eat salmon, tuna, and even sardines, which are all high in omega-3s and very good for your heart, brain, and circulation. Cutting out red meat and becoming a pescatarian worked out great for the stars listed below. </p>
<p> 10 Cam Newton </p>
<p> New England Patriots quarterback Cam Newton is just one of many athletes that went pescatarian, avoiding red meat and eating shrimp, and other fish. He has been a pescatarian for quite some time, but this year, he's gone fully vegan, crediting his newly plant-based diet for a boost in his health. </p>
<p> According to the football star, the shift to becoming a vegan has helped him recover after a shoulder injury in 2018. "I've seen a remarkable change in the way my body responds to the food I eat." He also shared in a video blog, "When you look at gorillas, when you look at elephants, they find their course of protein in plants and I do the same thing. I'm loving how I'm feeling." </p>
<p> 9 Olivia Wilde </p>
<p> Actress Olivia Wilde ditched her vegan diet to become a pescatarian, stating in a 2014 interview that it changed the way she looked at dieting. "Fear of carbs, of gluten, of everything - we've distanced ourselves from the beauty of food, the art of it," Wilde shared with Allure magazine. "It makes me sad when people say, 'Oh, I don't eat gluten. I don't eat cheese. I don't eat this. So I eat cardboard." </p>
<p> Even though the star no longer keeps up with the celeb trend of becoming a vegan, she still maintains a healthy outlook at eating by eating fish, which is an excellent source of B-complex vitamins, vitamin A and vitamin D. </p>
<p> 8 A$AP Rocky </p>
<p> In 2012, A$AP Rocky told Complex that he decided to become a pescatarian after learning about the brutal ways animals are slaughtered for their meat. "I don't eat meat, so people don't like to celebrate Thanksgiving with me. They can't enjoy it. Most people in my family, they mix meat in everything that they cook. So it's just pretty annoying," the rapper shared. </p>
<p> A$AP Rocky was so upset about the torture process of animals, especially the poultry industry that he eventually became a vegetarian and seems fully committed to never eating meat. </p>
<p> 7 Common </p>
<p> Common hasn't eaten meat since the '90s and told JustJared back in 2009 that he has been feeling much healthier with a pescatarian diet. "I just decided to be more aware of my health and well-being," the "Glory" singer shared, adding, "I felt that beef and pork wasn't good." </p>
<p> 6 Raven Goodwin </p>
<p> Raven Goodwin is best known for starring in the drama series Being Mary Jane and has shared that she is a fan of the pescatarian diet and that it has helped her become vegan. However, she confessed that if being a vegan doesn't work out for her, she'll gladly go back to eating fish. </p>
<p> This year, the actress showed off a slimmer figure on her Instagram and shared with her followers that she started a new health and fitness journey, which has clearly been working very well for the star. </p>
<p> 5 Steve Job </p>
<p> Steve Jobs was told by doctors and his family to consume more protein when he was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003. According to Owaves, Jobs developed a love for eating sushi including fatty tuna, salmon, and yellowtail, and also ate eggs some that he can consume more protein. </p>
<p> Before his diagnosis, Jobs considered himself a fruitarian, a subset of veganism, and would only eat foods like apples and carrots for weeks at a time. </p>
<p> 4 Ben Stiller </p>
<p> During an interview with Conan O'Brien, actor Ben Stiller spilled the details about his diet and how he was improving his lifestyle. The Meet the Fockers star shared that not only had he decided to let go of coffee, he became vegan, too. However, he mentioned that he'd eat fish here and there, which technically makes the actor a pescatarian. </p>
<p> While Stiller expressed that sticking to not eating meat can be hard, his wife, Christine Taylor explained that letting go of meat has improved her life. "It really changed our energy level. Sometimes you don't realize it until someone says it to you, like, 'your skin looks amazing," she shared. </p>
<p> 3 Victoria Beckham </p>
<p> Victoria Beckham always looks her best and that's because she follows a Five Hands Diet, according to The Daily Mail. The diet consists of just five handfuls of food a day, and Beckham reportedly snacks on small portions of smoked salmon, prawns with chili, yellow-fin tuna, and scrambled eggs. </p>
<p> The former Spice Girl went on a specific diet to lose the baby weight she gained when she was pregnant with her daughter, Harper. "Five days after birth, she started eating five high-protein meals a day accompanied by green vegetables, drinking gallons of water, and only snacking on goji berries and nuts," a source told Grazia magazine. </p>
<p> 2 Howard Stern </p>
<p> In 2012, while speaking with Grub Street, radio personality Howard Stern revealed that he and his wife gave up meat and became pescatarian. "We recently became pescatarians, which means the only protein we're getting is from seafood these days... we just learned the word pescatarian," he shared, adding that it "it felt really funny eating turkey and chicken... we stopped that completely." Stern also shared that he loves snacking on cashews and his favorite restaurant is Nobu, which serves mainly fish and seafood dishes. </p>
<p> 1 Kaley Cuoco </p>
<p> The Big Bang actress Kaley Cuoco follows a pescatarian diet, telling Women's Health magazine in 2016 that she was "done" with eating meat, though she does eat fish. In her interview, she broke down what she eats in a day, sharing that for breakfast, she'll have peanut butter on toast, for lunch, she'll chow down on half a sandwich, and for dinner, the star will usually eat fish and vegetables. </p>

<p> Chris Packham: what I eat </p>
<p> Breakfast </p>
<p> I have Asperger’s and I like routine, so I eat the same thing if I possibly can. Granola or muesli with soya milk – and that’s it. I gave up tea 10 years ago and haven’t drunk coffee since 1990. I was on the ceiling and didn’t like it. I just have water. </p>
<p> Lunch </p>
<p> If I’m at home with my partner, Charlotte, we’ll have cheese and biscuits. I like gruyère. If I’m on my own, I’ll skip lunch. </p>
<p> Dinner </p>
<p> I don’t eat meat. I make one of three things for dinner. I will have a pasta with tomato, peppers and Quorn, a stirfry or some grilled fish – seabass or salmon – with a peppery salad. </p>
<p> Snacks </p>
<p> At home I don’t snack, but I’ve just been away for work and I snacked to hell. I like my weight to be between 75 and 76kg but I’m well over where I want to be. I like sweet things. I frequently wake in the night with a sugar craving. My favourite is dried mango. Chocolate is my treat. I subscribe to Cocoa Runners, who send you four bars of fine chocolate from around the world once a month. There’s a fabulous one from Peru; I have some here from Madagascar, Indonesia and Newcastle. </p>
<p> There are things I won’t touch. I haven’t had a soft drink for 15 years. Crisps are another no-no. And I don’t eat fruit – I don’t like eating it manually. </p>

<p> What Should Conures Not Eat? 10 Foods to Avoid </p>
<p> Conures are one of the most wholesome pet companions you can have. They’re intelligent, bubbly, often comical and most importantly, come in a range of eye-catching colors. </p>
<p> They also have quite a long lifespan – up to 20 years or more; which means you get to enjoy their spunky awesomeness for a little bit more. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, many of the wild species of conure have nearly gone extinct mostly because of environmental changes and to some extent, human activities. </p>
<p> Bad diets, in particular, are a major cause of death to these precious birds and if you have a pet conure, or looking to get one in future, you need to feed it with the right foods to avoid illness and other complications. </p>
<p> So, through this article, I will take you through all the foods you should and shouldn’t feed your conures as well as what steps to take if your bird pet accidentally comes into contact with toxic foods. Sounds good? Ok… </p>
<p> Toxic Food For Conures </p>
<p> Harmful foods that you should never feed your pets include: </p>
<p> – Chocolate </p>
<p> Chocolate is a sweet, and relatively beneficial treat for humans but resist the temptation to share a bar with your conure. The reason being that while our digestive systems can fully process the main compounds in chocolate (that is, theobromine and caffeine), birds have difficulties doing so. </p>
<p> Matter of fact, chocolates can induce tremors, hyperactivity and increase heart rate in conures and higher levels may even cause death. If you really want to give your birdie a sugary treat, consider more healthier options, like a ripe banana, or maybe a grape. </p>
<p> – Avocado </p>
<p> Avocado fruits are high in the “good” fatty compounds, which is why it’s such a popular food within the wellness community. However, one component of the avocado plant, called persin, has been seen to have adverse effects on birds, ranging from heart failure to respiratory problems and even death. </p>
<p> Notably, the inner pulp contains lower concentrations of persin compared to the leaves, which explains why it’s considered safe for humans and even some bird types. </p>
<p> However, you may not know how much persin a given avocado contains and how it may affect your conure hence it’s safer to just keep them away from your bird. </p>
<p> – Candy </p>
<p> Sugary foods like candy are not recommended for humans and it also follows that you should also not give them to your conure. </p>
<p> For one, candies are very high in sugar, fats and sodium, all of which contribute to obesity and can also cause diarrhea and heart problems. </p>
<p> – Fruit Seeds </p>
<p> Fruits are generally safe and healthy for conures – except the ones mentioned here of course – but even so, don’t let your bird eat the seeds. </p>
<p> This is especially important when it comes to fruits like apples, pears, plums, cherries and apricots, as their seeds and pits contain very high levels of cardio-toxic cyanide, which causes death in birds. </p>
<p> If you really want to give some fruity treats, consider grapes, tomatoes, melons, pomegranates and squash, which are much safer options. </p>
<p> – Meat </p>
<p> While meat is not as harmful to conures and parrots as the other foods in this list are (wild birds eat lots of insects) it is still not advisable to feed it to your bird as you’re likely to overdo it. </p>
<p> Feeding your bird too much meat can promote buildup of fat deposits, leading to obesity, which is in itself a big health risk for parrots. </p>
<p> – Cheese </p>
<p> Cheese, and other similarly fatty foods like butter and nuts, cause health problems in humans, so imagine what they can do to the much smaller conures. </p>
<p> Even the tiniest bites of cheese can clog the birds’ arteries, making them susceptible to heart failure and stroke. And the smaller the bird, the higher the risk. </p>
<p> – Peanuts </p>
<p> Peanuts are typically very rich in fats, yet almost deficient in other minerals like calcium and vitamin A. Giving them to your bird promotes fat buildup while not adding any nutritional value to them, which basically leads to malnutrition. </p>
<p> Peanuts, and other seeds in general, are pretty useless when offered as standalone meals, and are better included in more balanced diets. </p>
<p> – Coffee Beans </p>
<p> Coffee beans are rich in caffeine which is considerably more effective (read harmful) to conures than in humans, for obvious reasons. </p>
<p> A few sips of coffee beans may not sound bad to you but the caffeine in it may significantly increase your bird’s heart rate, lead to hyperactivity, and potentially trigger cardiac arrest. </p>
<p> Remember that caffeine is not limited to coffee but is also present in tea, soda and many other beverages, so you may want to stick to only giving clean water. </p>
<p> – Onion and Garlic </p>
<p> They may sound cute and healthy, but onions and garlic are one of the most dangerous foods you can ever feed your bird (or any pet, for that matter). </p>
<p> Onions, in particular, contain lots of sulfur, which is a very potent toxin that can cause anemia and in a worse case scenario, rupture of red blood cells. </p>
<p> Hell, the sulfur composition remains the same whether the onions are cooked, raw or dehydrated so avoid feeding your conure with cooked food containing onions. </p>
<p> Garlic, on the other hand, contains a compound called allicin, which is also toxic to birds like conures. Intake of allicin can also cause anemia or even death in birds. </p>
<p> Admittedly, this chemical is not present in all garlic variants but since you probably won’t be able to tell which ones have it, it is advisable to keep away all garlic from your birdie’s reach. </p>
<p> – Mushroom </p>
<p> A lot of mushroom varieties are neither safe for human nor bird consumption and are generally best avoided. Some mushrooms may also be variably toxic – in that they’re toxic at different heat levels, or in different areas, and safe in others. </p>
<p> So, unless you are willing to conduct thorough scientific analysis on every bit of shroom you give to your bird, you may want to just avoid them all. </p>
<p> What Conure Birds Should Eat? </p>
<p> Avian nutritionists recommend feeding your pet conure a diet similar to the one they would take if they were in the wild. In essence, 50-70 percent of the diet should contain pellets, while the remaining 30-50 percent should consist of fresh foods. </p>
<p> You can find a lot of fortified and nutritious pellets at an avian pet shop so you don’t need to worry about that. For the fresh feeds, consider organic veggies (raw or steamed), small amounts of fruite, cooked whole grains like rice, oats, barley and legumes. </p>
<p> For more balanced meals, use the Chop Approach, which involves cooking a bunch of grains, legumes and chopped vegetables then mixing them in a large container, which then goes into the fridge. </p>
<p> Every day, take a serving of the food, warm it, then feed it to your birdie. The whole thing saves you time and ensures that every day, your pet will get the required mix of nutrients and vitamins. </p>
<p> What to Do If Your Conure Accidentally Eats Toxic Food? </p>
<p> If your conure somehow gets in contact with any of the toxic foods mentioned above, you need to swing into action as fast as you can to save its life. </p>
<p> The first course of action, naturally, should be to assess the situation (is the bird still breathing? Any seizures? Is there evidence of hemorrhage? etc), then depending on the circumstances, stabilize the bird and throw away any toxic substances in the vicinity. </p>
<p> Stabilization procedures here may include performing CPR, giving water, controlling seizures, taking the bird outside for fresh air, and so forth. </p>
<p> The next logical step is visit a vet for the necessary tests and evaluation and to get more informed advice on the next steps. </p>
<p> Remember, you should still visit the vet even when your bird shows recovery after your stabilization procedures, as there may still be other unsolved internal problems that you didn’t notice, and which may cause problems later. </p>
<p> A full medical evaluation gives you a more clear picture and helps make timely, and potentially lifesaving interventions. </p>
<p> Wrapping Up </p>
<p> Taking care of your feathered friend goes beyond providing shelter, companionship and food. </p>
<p> Providing the right types of food is extremely essential to enhancing the bird’s health and lifespan, and subsequently increasing your mutual bond. </p>

<doc id="file21599620" filename="cough-after-eating" parent_folder="web2" url="https://www.healthline.com/health/cough-after-eating">
<p> 6 Reasons You Cough After Eating </p>
<p> Many people have a mysterious cough after eating. It might happen after every meal or only occasionally. There are several possible causes of this, including acid reflux, asthma, food allergies, and dysphagia, which refers to difficulty swallowing. </p>
<p> Coughing is your body’s way of keeping irritants out of your respiratory system, so work with your doctor to figure out what’s causing the irritation. Most causes are treatable by changing your diet and eating habits or taking medication. </p>
<p> Acid reflux happens when stomach acid moves back up to your esophagus. There’s a band of muscle around the bottom of your esophagus called the lower esophageal sphincter. When you eat or drink, it relaxes, allowing food and liquid to move into your stomach. Sometimes it doesn’t completely close after you eat or drink, allowing acid from your stomach to move up into your esophagus. This irritates your esophagus, which may cause you to cough. </p>
<p> Other symptoms of acid reflux include: </p>
<p> sore throat </p>
<p> bitter taste in the back of your throat </p>
<p> sour taste in your mouth </p>
<p> burning sensation in your chest, known as heartburn </p>
<p> Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) </p>
<p> GERD is an ongoing, more severe form of acid reflux. A chronic cough, especially after eating, is a common symptom. </p>
<p> nausea or vomiting </p>
<p> trouble swallowing </p>
<p> Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) </p>
<p> LPR, sometimes called silent reflux because it doesn’t have traditional reflux symptoms, is a type of GERD that involves stomach acid passing through your esophagus and into your larynx or even your nose. You can have LPR with or without GERD. LPR can make you cough during and after meals. You might also cough when waking up, talking, or laughing. </p>
<p> Symptoms of LPR include: </p>
<p> hoarseness </p>
<p> constantly needing to clear your throat </p>
<p> sensation of something dripping down the back of your throat from the nose, called postnasal drip </p>
<p> Talk to your doctor if you have any LPR symptoms. Untreated LPR may eventually lead to voice disorders or throat ulcers, so early treatment is key. </p>
<p> There isn’t a cure for acid reflux, GERD, or LPR, but certain medications and home treatments can help you manage the symptoms. </p>
<p> Many coughs are caused by upper respiratory infections, but these coughs usually clear up within two to three weeks. Any cough lasting 8 weeks or longer is considered chronic. A chronic cough after eating could be caused by an infection that never healed properly. </p>
<p> A cough caused by an infection sounds like a harsh, dry, persistent hack. This cough causes inflammation to the airway, which can lead to more coughing. </p>
<p> Coughs caused by infections are difficult to treat because the cycle of inflammation and coughing prevents healing. If the cough doesn’t go away, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatories, such as inhaled or oral steroids. </p>
<p> Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the lungs. It can cause wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. Asthma usually starts in childhood, but it can also appear when you’re older. Coughing caused by asthma is usually worse late at night or early in the morning. </p>
<p> The symptoms of asthma worsen during an attack. Many things that can trigger an asthma attack, including sulphites, which are in beer and wine as well as dried fruits and vegetables, pickled onions, and soft drinks. If you tend to cough after eating or drinking any of these, asthma could be the cause. </p>
<p> You can often easily manage asthma using medications and avoiding common asthma triggers. </p>
<p> Food allergies usually develop when you’re a child, but they can strike at any age. It’s even possible to develop an allergy to a food that you’ve been eating for years. Food allergies typically cause an allergic response within two hours of eating. </p>
<p> Allergic reaction symptoms vary from person to person, and they sometimes affect the respiratory system, causing you to cough. Other respiratory symptoms of a food allergy include wheezing and shortness of breath. </p>
<p> In rare cases, food allergies can lead to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition that affects your breathing. Make sure you know how to recognize it so you can get immediate treatment. </p>
<p> Dysphagia refers to having difficulty swallowing. If you have dysphagia, your body takes more time and effort to move food and liquid into your stomach, making swallowing painful or almost impossible. This can lead to coughing or gagging while swallowing. Dysphagia can also make it feel like you have food stuck in your throat, causing you to cough. </p>
<p> Many conditions can cause dysphagia, including acid reflux and GERD. Work with you doctor to figure out what’s causing your dysphagia. Sometimes simple exercises are enough to fix the problem. In more serious cases, you may need an endoscopic procedure or surgery. </p>
<p> Sometimes small pieces of food or drops of liquid are inhaled into your lungs, where they can introduce bacteria. This usually happens when you swallow something and it “goes down the wrong hole.” Healthy lungs typically clear themselves out, but if they don’t, these bacteria can cause a serious condition called aspiration pneumonia. Having acid reflux or dysphagia increases your risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. </p>
<p> A wet-sounding cough after eating is a symptom of aspiration pneumonia. You may also cough up mucus that looks green or bloody. Other symptoms include: </p>
<p> fever that starts within an hour of eating </p>
<p> shortness of breath or fatigue while eating or drinking </p>
<p> Left untreated, aspiration pneumonia can cause serious problems, such as a lung abscess or respiratory failure. Talk to your doctor as soon as possible if you think you might have aspiration pneumonia. </p>
<p> Regardless of what’s causing you to cough after eating, some simple steps may help you cough less and avoid complications such as aspiration pneumonia: </p>
<p> Eat slowly. </p>
<p> Keep a food diary and mark any foods that make you cough. </p>
<p> Don’t eat during a coughing attack — this could lead to choking. </p>
<p> Take all your medications, especially those for acid reflux or asthma, as prescribed. </p>
<p> Keep a glass of water nearby when you’re eating and take lots of sips. </p>
<p> Several things can make you cough after eating, and most of them are easy to treat or manage. Keep track of any additional symptoms you have and work with your doctor to figure out the underlying cause. </p>

<p> Why Do I Cough When I Eat? </p>
<p> By Staff WriterLast Updated March 29, 2020 </p>
<p> Follow Us: </p>
<p> Coughing during and after eating may be a result of a serious condition called dysphagia, which causes a person to have trouble properly swallowing and digesting food. Dysphagia can result in numerous symptoms, coughing while eating being just one. This is a complex condition that tends to occur in older people who struggle with dry mouth, notes About.com. </p>
<p> MedlinePlus identifies symptoms of dysphagia as choking, struggling to chew, food sticking in the throat, chest pain, heartburn, sour taste and nausea. A person may not experience all of these symptoms; however, it is important to see a doctor about this condition if coughing is persistent. </p>
<p> Elderly people displaying these symptoms are especially vulnerable. According to an article by Maura Keller on Today's Geriatric Medicine, older people are at risk of experiencing aspiration. This happens when food or liquid leaks into the lungs. Swallowing difficulties can also lead to malnutrition. </p>
<p> Multiple sclerosis is another serious disorder that has a direct link to dysphagia symptoms. Swallowing involves coordination between the nerves, muscles and brain. All of these areas are negatively impacted by MS. Symptoms related to dysphagia can come and go, according to Dr. Julie Stachowiak. If dysphagia is not the problem, the coughing may be caused by asthma, postnasal drip or gastrointestinal problems. </p>

<p> Meet The Couple Who Only Eat Fruit And Never Brush Their Teeth </p>
<p> By Jessica Miller, Published on Apr 29, 2019 </p>
<p> The life of a fruitarian </p>
<p> Because we all choose to live our own lives, we all know what we like and want to eat, and what we don’t. For some, this means eating what they want, when they want. They will eat meat, they will eat dairy, and they’ll eat anything that lands on the dish in front of them. </p>
<p> However, there are others who don’t follow this doctrine. Many people have adopted vegetarian and vegan lifestyles over the years, and the trend has become increasingly popular. Yet, have you ever heard of a fruitarian? </p>
<p> The couple in question </p>
<p> Well, two people who live by a fruitarian lifestyle are Tina Stoklosa (39) and Simon Beun (26). The couple are currently gearing up to tie the knot and solidify their love, and they are getting ready to do so at their home on the beautiful Indonesian island of Bali. </p>
<p> Over the past few years, the couple has become famous on social media for their way of life. They have shared pictures and videos of their fruitarian lifestyle on Instagram and on their YouTube channel, and it’s fair to say that people have a lot to say about their choices. </p>
<p> A normal day </p>
<p> Perhaps the biggest question Tina and Simon are faced with is: What do you eat? A fruitarian is someone who only eats fruits and avoids all other foods within their diet. Because of this, the couple have to cater their daily dishes to suit this lifestyle. </p>
<p> For breakfast, they will drink four glasses of freshly squeezed orange juice. For lunch, they will drink a banana smoothie made from seven fresh bananas, as well as half an avocado on the side. As a snack, they will munch on two dates. Then, for dinner, they will have two glasses of orange juice and a whole avocado! </p>
<p> A whole load of benefits </p>
<p> To most of us, that seems like a very small and insignificant food experience. After all, they seem more like snacks rather than actual meals. However, this daily diet provides them with just over 2,000 calories, and they swear by the health benefits. </p>
<p> Over the course of their fruitarian lifestyle change, the couple have noted that they have become more energetic, they feel healthier than they ever have before, they look younger, and that they never been ill. In their eyes, it’s a miracle diet that they will never stray from ever again. </p>
<p> Not always been that way </p>
<p> While Tina and Simon have now thoroughly embraced their fruitarian existence, it hasn’t always been that way. In fact, they have only been a couple for a few years, and Bali hasn’t always been their home. Both Tina and Simon come from two completely different walks of life and from two completely different countries. </p>
<p> Just a few years ago they were just like every other Average Joe who would eat animal products and go about their typical 9-5. Yet, they gave this all up to change their lifestyle for what they believe is the better. </p>
<p> The life of Tina </p>
<p> Before she moved to Bali and met Simon, Tina was living in her home country of Poland. She had set up residence in Warsaw and worked as a successful interior design architect. Although she had a great job and a wonderful set of friends, Tina didn’t feel as though she was very happy in her life. </p>
<p> She knew that she should be grateful for what she had around her, but there was always something that pulled her back down to earth. No matter how successful she became, Tina never felt comfortable in her own body. </p>
<p> A binge eater </p>
<p> During an interview with the Daily Mail, Tina noted that she had been overweight for much of her life before adopting a fruitarian diet. She felt uncomfortable with her weight, and she tried every diet in the book. </p>
<p> However, nothing worked for her, and she soon turned to binge eating to help curb her emotions and make her feel better about herself and her appearance – if only for an hour or two. Yet, this was a vicious cycle for Tina, as she believed her increasing weight was the reason she was still single, and the reason that she didn’t feel as though she was beautiful. </p>
<p> Making a few changes </p>
<p> By the time 2013 came around, Tina was becoming increasingly upset. She knew that she wanted to lose weight, but she just couldn’t seem to do it. As Christmas loomed ever closer, she aimed to feel at least a little bit more comfortable in herself and her body. </p>
<p> So, she decided to look for a new diet that would hopefully allow her to stop binge-eating and lose the pounds that she had built up. It was this decision that ultimately changed her life and put her on the path of fruitarianism. </p>
<p> Stumbling across it </p>
<p> As Tina began to research healthy smoothies that would allow her to increase the amount of fruit and vegetables into her diet, she stumbled across a woman who only ate fruit. She was intrigued and decided to do a bit more digging into this strange lifestyle. </p>
<p> As Tina did this, she realized that this woman wasn’t just a singular person who had decided to try out a rather different approach to eating. She saw that there were thousands of fruitarians across the globe who had decided to set up their own online community and help each other through the motions. </p>
<p> Couldn’t believe it </p>
<p> At first, Tina was skeptical. She couldn’t believe that people who only had fruit in their diet could be living a healthy and happy lifestyle, and she wanted to know more. It was during these investigations that she realized the people who had adopted this diet looked better than the people she walked past in the street. </p>
<p> They were slim but not too skinny, they didn’t look wrinkly or old, and they looked incredibly happy and healthy. The more she read about it, the more she was intrigued. </p>
<p> Endurance athletes </p>
<p> The fruitarians that Tina found on the internet weren’t just people who worked office jobs or sat in their bedrooms playing video games. A large portion of them were endurance athletes who needed to be fit, healthy, and energetic to take part in races and competitions. </p>
<p> Because Tina was concerned that a fruit-only diet would leave her feeling weak and hungry, she was amazed to see that these people were so spritely and full of life. Thanks to this research, Tina decided to give fruitarianism a go for a week. </p>
<p> The positive effects </p>
<p> Although she was worried that the transition would be difficult, Tina noticed that she felt a difference in her mental and physical health almost instantly. After just a few days her whole perspective on life had changed, and she felt like a completely different person. </p>
<p> She felt light and optimistic, and she felt as though she was “in love with everything.” Tina also felt as though she had more energy and that she could take on anything she put her mind to. In her eyes, the fruit was worth it even just for the mental changes. </p>
<p> A permanent change </p>
<p> After the week came to a close, Tina realized that she didn’t want to go back to “normal” food. She had grown to love the sweet taste of the fruit that she ate on a daily basis, but it wasn’t all that easy. </p>
<p> Because her body was so accustomed to eating meat, dairy, nuts, legumes, and more, it began to crave these things. On a few occasions, Tina decided to give in to these cravings, but she never felt the buzz from this food that she felt when she ate her fruitarian diet. </p>
<p> Becoming more strict </p>
<p> Because of this, Tina decided to become more strict with herself over the next few years. She wanted to become a fruitarian full-time, and she didn’t want to feel herself slipping. As she did this, she realized that her physical body was also changing. </p>
<p> After years of struggling to shed her excess weight, Tina found the weight just fell off her as the adopted the fruitarian lifestyle. She became happier in herself and her outward appearance, and she felt so much lighter. It was what she had always dreamed of. </p>
<p> Losing the weight </p>
<p> Within just a few months of ditching normal cooked food for a raw fruitarian diet, Tina lost a huge amount of weight. She went from weighing 183 pounds to 113 pounds, and she dropped four dress sizes. </p>
<p> Although many years have passed since that initial weight loss, Tina has found that she has not regained any of that weight since. She has noted that she can eat as much fruit as she wants, and even eat as much as her fiancé, but she knows that there is little chance of her ever gaining this weight back. </p>
<p> Finding something new </p>
<p> After two years of living a strict fruitarian diet, Tina was more confident than ever that it was the lifestyle for her. Not only did she enjoy the fruit that she was eating, but she felt better than she had ever felt in her life – and that was all down to her food intake. </p>
<p> However, she found that her fruit options were limited in her home country of Poland. She was getting bored of the same fruit every single day, and she wanted to try something more exotic. So, she decided to quit her job, pack her bags, and book a one-way flight to Bali. </p>
<p> Documenting her life </p>
<p> Moving to Bali was a big step for the interior design architect, but she wanted to dedicate her life to her fruitarian existence without the interruption of the Western world – and Bali was the place to do that. Yet, she didn’t want to cut herself off completely. </p>
<p> To keep in touch with other fruitarians across the globe, Tina decided to set up social media accounts for herself. She created a YouTube channel where others could follow her new life, and she even started an Instagram page to document her everyday actions. </p>
<p> On his own journey </p>
<p> It was through these social media channels that she first laid eyes on her now-fiancé, Simon. Like her, he was on his own journey into the realm of fruitarianism, and he was intrigued by her life. However, Simon was not from Poland or Bali. </p>
<p> He was born in Izegem in Belgium, and his upbringing had been very different. Unlike Tina, he had not struggled with his weight or struggled with his eating habits over the years. He instead wanted to transform his body so that he would be in peak condition, but he just didn’t know how. </p>
<p> A keen athlete </p>
<p> As a keen athlete, Simon had always been active in terms of his physical health. He was the kind of person who wanted to push his athletic ability to the limit and wanted to see just how far he could go. </p>
<p> Because he wanted his body to be as healthy as can be, Simon decided to adopt a vegan lifestyle during his late teens and early 20s. He removed all traces of animal product from his diet and tried to eat as organically as possible. This seemed to work for him, so he decided to maintain this lifestyle. </p>
<p> Looking for inspiration </p>
<p> When Simon was in his final year of college, he signed himself up for a local marathon race. He was determined to push his body and achieve his personal best, so tried to find inspiration online. </p>
<p> The athlete often found solace in others who were going through the same journey as him, but he also loved to watch those who had already reached their goals. He had athletic idols, and he looked to them for guidance and advice within his own journey. It was during this investigation that he came across a specific athlete. </p>
<p> A truck full of fruit </p>
<p> As Simon continued to watch videos online, he stumbled upon a marathon runner by the name of Michael Arnstein. Although Michael is known for being an impressive runner who loves to showcase his talent, he’s also known for being a fruitarian. </p>
<p> Simon only realized this when he saw the athlete stock up on watermelon and bananas for one of his races. Arnstein placed the fruit on a truck and had it follow him during an ultra-marathon. Simon was intrigued and decided to investigate further. </p>
<p> Open to making changes </p>
<p> The Belgian native was amazed to see that Michael was so successful even after removing the likes of protein from his diet, and could see that the athlete wasn’t struggling. He looked in peak health, and he looked as though he had all the energy in the world to complete his ultra-marathon. </p>
<p> Because Simon himself was open to making changes to his diet for the sake of his health and fitness, he decided to give fruitarianism a go. In that instant, he decided that fruitarianism was the way forward. </p>
<p> Changing it overnight </p>
<p> Simon changed his diet overnight and made the decision to never go back to normal food. He was ready and willing to make the sacrifice for his health, and he was ready to make these drastic changes for the sake of his athleticism. </p>
<p> Because he loved to see what other people were doing in their lives, he soon found the large community of fruitarians online and tried to find help and guidance from them. It was during this round-up on social media platforms that he stumbled across Tina’s profile. </p>
<p> Messaging her </p>
<p> Simon was impressed with Tina’s dedication to fruitarianism, and he also couldn’t deny the fact that he was attracted to her. He decided to reach out to her on Instagram and sent her a message, asking about her life and her dietary habits. </p>
<p> Tina replied to him, and they soon began sending messages back and forth for many months. After six months of talking online, Simon realized that he wanted to take things to the next level with Tina, and she wanted to actually meet her in person. So, he flew to Bali. </p>
<p> Falling in love </p>
<p> Both Tina and Simon were excited to meet each other in person, and they immediately that they had a connection. Not only did they have a romantic connection, but they also had similar views when it came to their thoughts and beliefs on the world. </p>
<p> They were both interested in fruitarianism, and they both wanted to explore some of the most delicious fruits in the world while also living as happily and healthily as possible. Before too long, they fell in love and decided to build their life together in Bali. </p>
<p> An impressive connection </p>
<p> After falling in love and realizing that they didn’t want to part ways, Simon decided to join Tina in Bali. They have since made it their mission to travel around the island and try out some of the most delicious and exotic fruits that are on offer, and they are documenting the whole thing on social media. </p>
<p> They call themselves @fit_shortie_eats on Instagram, and they have nearly 50,000 followers! As if that wasn’t enough, the couple also films regular videos for their YouTube channel of the same name, which has over 54,000 subscribers. </p>
<p> A cure for wellness </p>
<p> Simon and Tina now spend their days advocating the fruitarian lifestyle, and one of the biggest reasons for this is because they believe it is the healthiest diet on offer. In fact, they believe that a fruitarian diet can actually cure diseases and medical conditions. </p>
<p> During an interview with the Daily Mail, Tina noted that eating a fruit-only diet can help to cure depression as well as many other mental illnesses, such as anxiety. As if that wasn’t enough, they also believe that it can cure digestive issues and even cancer. </p>
<p> No scientific evidence </p>
<p> Of course, many scientists and nutritionists have criticized the couple for their way of life, and have noted that nothing can cure cancer or other similar diseases. These experts have noted that there is no scientific evidence to support their claims, but Tina and Simon don’t need evidence for their lifestyle. </p>
<p> They believe that they are living proof that fruitarianism is good for you, and that this lifestyle change can be beneficial to your health. They have also noted that they have known fruitarians who have cured their cancer through their fruit-only diet. </p>
<p> Connected to nature </p>
<p> More than anything, the couple believes that their fruitarian lifestyle brings them closer to nature. They feel as though they are connected to Mother Earth, and believe that it is their mission to taste all of Her fruits. In their eyes, the more exotic, the better! </p>
<p> Because of this, they spend most of their days foraging around the rainforest near to their home. They create videos of what they search for, how they forage for them, and what these fruits look like when they are cut open. It’s safe to say that these videos garner a lot of attention. </p>
<p> Sharing their stories </p>
<p> As well as sharing their own experiences of living as fruitarians, Tina and Simon also share other stories on their social media profiles. They like to share the experiences of other fruitarians, and state how changing up their diets have changed their lives for the better. </p>
<p> They hope that this will persuade others to do their research and make a few changes to their own food habits because they aren’t the only ones who have experienced physical and mental benefits. Alongside this, they also love to congratulate their fellow fruit-lovers. </p>
<p> Monetary benefits </p>
<p> In Tina and Simon’s eyes, the benefits of a fruitarian lifestyle have impacted their lives in more ways than they can count. They feel happier, they feel healthier, and they feel on top of the world. However, this isn’t the only way the fruitarian diet has changed their lives. </p>
<p> Eating only fruit also has monetary benefits for the couple, as they do not require a kitchen or any appliances to cook their food. As if that wasn’t enough, they also rarely have to shell out money on food because they forage for it. Because of this, they live a very minimalist lifestyle. </p>
<p> Saving money </p>
<p> The couple doesn’t just save money on food, though. They also save money on buying toothbrushes and toothpaste, because they don’t brush their teeth! It may sound strange to many of us, but the couple have avoided brushing their teeth since moving to Bali because they don’t feel the need to. </p>
<p> In their opinion, their teeth and gums are as healthy as can be, and they don’t need any outside fluoride or brushing to do what Mother Nature can do on Her own. So, does that mean they have dirty teeth? </p>
<p> High sugar content </p>
<p> Because the couple relies on fruits that are high in natural sugars, you might think that Tina and Simon would have rotten teeth that would be in desperate need of a trip to the dentist. However, that isn’t the case. The couple are of the opinion that the high levels of fiber in their diet cleans their teeth for them. </p>
<p> They believe that these fruits rid their teeth and gums of any dirt or decay, and leave them looking and feeling sparkling clean. To make sure that this was the case, Tina even went to the dentist a few years after her fruitarian transformation. </p>
<p> Going for a check-up </p>
<p> After a few years of only eating fruit, Tina made her way to the dentist for him to check out what was going on with her gums. He was amazed to see the health and the quality of her teeth, and couldn’t believe that she had achieved such a result without brushing her teeth at all. </p>
<p> In fact, Tina told the Daily Mail that the dentist had to call in his colleagues to take a look inside her mouth. They just couldn’t get their heads around the fact that her teeth were so perfect. </p>
<p> Not the same </p>
<p> Although Tina would love to inspire any fruitarian to ditch the toothbrush and to ditch brushing twice a day, she does have a few words of warning. Not brushing your teeth only works if you are going to eat raw and fresh fruit all day. </p>
<p> It’s not the same if you eat dried fruit, because this dry food can stick to your gums and rot while in your teeth. Because of this, you need to make sure that you are eating as fresh as possible – just as she is. </p>
<p> Trying something new </p>
<p> Despite the fact that Tina and Simon are extremely content with their fruitarian lifestyle in Bali, they are constantly on the lookout for something more exciting. They travel around the country and the rest of the world in search of new fruits that will tickle their taste buds and become a staple in their lives. </p>
<p> They have made it their mission to find the most exotic fruit in the world, and they also make sure that they try the best quality. They base their diet on what’s in season, and what fruit will be as high quality as possible. </p>
<p> A new addition </p>
<p> For many years, Tina and Simon have only had to think about themselves. They have only had to provide for themselves, and they have only had to forage for themselves. However, this all changed in 2018 when the couple discovered that they were expecting a baby. </p>
<p> They were over the moon with the news, and it’s fair to say that their followers were also excited for the new addition. Tina maintained her fruitarian diet throughout her pregnancy and even created special pregnancy-related videos for their popular YouTube channel. </p>
<p> Raising him the same </p>
<p> Tina and Simon welcomed baby Leo into the world on March 30th, 2019. The couple instantly fell in love with their little one, but they were also inundated with comments from people across the globe. </p>
<p> These people wanted to know if the couple were planning on raising their child on their fruitarian lifestyle, and it didn’t take them long to answer. The couple have no doubt about the fact that they will raise their child solely on a fruit diet, as they believe it’s the healthiest diet for him. </p>
<p> Ignoring the haters </p>
<p> Of course, this decision has not come without controversy. Since making the transition into fruitarianism – and especially since welcoming Leo into the world – they have been overwhelmed with negative comments. </p>
<p> Many believe that it’s wrong of the couple to force such a lifestyle on their baby, and there are even some who have called their decision child abuse. For the most part, Tina and Simon ignore the haters and brush the comments off. They let them slide off them like water off a duck’s back. </p>
<p> A different perspective </p>
<p> Shannon Cooper from Brisbane, Australia, decided to raise her kid on a zero-carb and zero-sugar diet, and the results were unreal. The Paleo diet is known officially as the Paleolithic diet and follows the rules of the caveman. The general premise is simple: If a caveman couldn’t hunt or gather it themselves, then you shouldn’t be putting it in your body. This diet consists of fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as meat and fish, and aims to completely cut out processed foods. </p>
<p> What the experts say </p>
<p> It’s safe to say that the medical world is divided when it comes to the Paleo diet. Many experts suggest that eating natural food is healthier than the processed food we eat in today’s day and age because it is rich in the minerals and vitamins we need to thrive. This diet also cuts out the likes of fat and sodium, which can both have adverse effects on our body. It was perfect for the cavemen, but is it healthy for a newborn baby? </p>
<p> A few negatives </p>
<p> Although many experts suggest the Paleo diet is healthy, there are others who have their doubts. While our cavemen ancestors were strong and fairly healthy, they were also incredibly vulnerable to diseases and parasites from the meat and plants that they ate. Alongside this, it’s also been confirmed that these cavemen also had hardened arteries, which can cause major blockages later in life. This can then lead to more serious health conditions, such as heart disease, heart attacks, blood clots, and strokes. </p>
<p> Approaching with caution </p>
<p> Of course, Shannon knew that she shouldn’t just go full steam ahead with Grace’s diet plan. She approached the idea with caution and even asked a doctor for their opinion on the matter. Was it healthy to raise a child on this diet? Because there is very little research into raising babies on the Paleo diet, the doctor could not give Shannon a proper answer. She would need to make that decision herself. She decided to go ahead with the plan, with just one exception. </p>
<p> Making just one exception </p>
<p> If Shannon were to follow the Paleo diet properly, Grace would not be allowed any breast milk. However, Shannon knew that she had to make an exception on this matter. She wanted to breastfeed her daughter for the first few months of her life, and she knew that it was the best option. After all, babies can’t eat meat and handfuls of vegetables. She would have to disregard this rule for a while, at least until she could find an alternative for baby Grace. </p>
<p> Finding an alternative </p>
<p> Because more and more people are adopting the Paleo diet, you can now find recipes for Paleo baby formula that you can make at home. Although many parents are choosing to use this, experts are warning new moms and dads against this route. In fact, one health expert has noted that certain DIY formulas can “cause permanent damage” or even be fatal to the child. That’s because these formulas include nutrients that are too complicated for babies to digest or break down. </p>
<p> Making it herself </p>
<p> After successfully breastfeeding her daughter, Shannon made the decision to gradually move her daughter onto her own homemade baby food. She did not want to buy any processed jars, because she could never know what was truly going into her baby’s body. So, she bypassed the baby food aisle in her grocery store, and instead opted to blend up fruits and vegetables into a paste that would be much more nutritious for the growth and the development of her child. </p>
<p> Making a smooth transition </p>
<p> Shannon made an incredibly smooth transition into solids. Instead of breastfeeding one day and giving her homemade food the next day, Shannon tried to incorporate solid food onto Grace’s plate one small step at a time. She would gradually up the quantities of food, and decrease the amount of times that Grace would breastfeed. This was the only way for Shannon to really know what her daughter was eating. Little did she know this diet would have a drastic effect on her daughter. </p>
<p> A special bond </p>
<p> As Grace finally made her way onto full plates of solid food, Shannon made the decision to document the food that they would eat together. She would create colorful plates of vegetables, fruit, and meat, and she would get Grace to help her prepare these meals. This was not only a great way for them to bond, but it was also a great way to get Grace involved in the healthy lifestyle she was adopting. However, those who saw the photographs were a little concerned about this. </p>
<p> Keeping them at bay </p>
<p> In fact, by the time Grace was just 13 months old, she was eating healthy meals that many adults have still not tried to this day. She would go about her day with a stomach full of chia pudding, quinoa porridge, and sauerkraut, and she was apparently loving every second of it. Yet, Grace’s Paleo diet was not just about what she was putting in her body. She was not allowed to eat carbs or sugary treats, which most children eat as youngsters. </p>
<p> No sign of illness </p>
<p> Shannon has kept a close eye on Grace throughout the Paleo diet, and it’s safe to say that she has been delighted with the results. The mom notes that her daughter is always full of life and energy, and is rarely ever ill. In fact, she has confessed that her daughter has only had one small cold over the course of her life! She believes that her heightened immune system is all thanks to her Paleo diet, and she can’t believe how much healthier she is. </p>
<p> Making a name for herself </p>
<p> Many critics have fired back at Shannon and her decision to raise Grace on a Paleo diet, but Shannon stands by her choice. She has seen the results for herself, and she has seen her daughter in comparison to other children. She believes that Grace is much healthier, and she believes that she is also much happier. Because she feels so strongly about this diet, Shannon has since made a name for herself as an author, and she has released numerous Paleo cookbooks. </p>
<p> Taking from everything </p>
<p> Shannon also rejects the notion that she is raising Grace on a specific Paleo diet. Instead, she likes to suggest that she is simply raising her daughter on a healthy diet. She takes certain elements that she likes from various different diets and ways of life, and hopes to incorporate these onto Grace’s plate. While Shannon is convinced that her daughter will stick to this diet as she grows older, there are skeptics who believe otherwise and believe that she may get jealous when she sees other kids. </p>
<p> Not stopping her </p>
<p> Shannon has been incredibly clear about how she feels on this matter. Although she is now trying to raise her daughter on a very specific diet, she knows it may not last. She doesn’t want this to happen, either. The last thing she wants is to feel as though her daughter resents her because she can’t have a slice of cake at her friends’ birthday party, and she knows that Grace will eventually experiment. Shannon will not stop her from doing this. </p>
<p> Educating her daughter </p>
<p> For the most part, Shannon wants to know that she is educating her daughter on healthy foods and a healthy lifestyle. When she gets older, Shannon is more than willing to let her daughter move away from the Paleo diet if that’s what she wants. However, she also hopes that when Grace tries these sugary foods and carbs, she will know enough to understand that these foods are not beneficial to a healthy diet. She wants her daughter to make the right decisions in her life. </p>
<p> A bout of criticism </p>
<p> Although Shannon stands by her decision to raise Grace on a Paleo diet, there are other people who aren’t so convinced. She has received huge bouts of criticism over the years from those who do not agree with her strict diet regime. Many suggest that Grace should be able to live like any other kid and try out the foods that might not necessarily be the healthiest for her, and others believe that Shannon is forcing something onto Grace that she might not want to follow. </p>
<p> Confused at the response </p>
<p> While the mom accepts that everyone has their own opinions, she does not get the logic behind these haters. She is often confused as to why parents are so shocked by the fact that she feeds her daughter healthy fruits and vegetables, while they themselves let their children eat takeout and fast food. In her eyes, her way of raising her child is much more healthy and beneficial, but she had no idea that this was just the start of the media storm that was coming. </p>
<p> Something to say </p>
<p> It seemed as though the whole world has had something to say on Shannon’s decision, and she has received messages and comments from people across the globe. As if that wasn’t enough, Shannon has also had nutritional experts reach out to her and criticize her choice. One particular expert told her that it was not healthy to give a young child such a regimented diet and that there was no scientific proof to say that the Paleo diet was beneficial in any way. </p>
<p> It’s completely normal </p>
<p> Although Shannon has listened to what everyone has to say, she has also stood by her decision. She has seen with her own eyes just how healthy, and happy Grace has grown up to be, and she doesn’t see anything wrong with her diet. She has noted that Grace does not eat anything a regular adult wouldn’t eat, so why should it be an issue? To finish up her argument for the Paleo diet, Shannon has one last piece of information to win over those who don’t agree. </p>
<p> Feeling good </p>
<p> The main thing that Shannon has discovered about her daughter is that she is healthy and happy, and there is nothing that matters more to her than that. She puts this down to the good food that is going into her gut and the fact that she enjoys what is put on her plate. She does not grumble but actually loves to eat the food that her mother makes her. At the end of the day, Shannon wants her daughter to “eat what makes her feel good.” </p>
<p> My Food Religion </p>
<p> Because she has seen the effects of healthy living for herself, Shannon now dedicates her life to helping others make changes to their health and wellbeing. As well as working as a health and wellness coach, she also has her own portion of the internet that she calls “myfoodreligion.” This is where she showcases her cooking skills, her tips and tricks, and even a few exercises to help others make the most of their bodies. But what does Grace think about all this? </p>
<p> Getting older </p>
<p> In August 2018, Shannon shared a photograph of her daughter on her Instagram page, and caught them up to date with the fact that Grace was off to her first day of kindergarten! She couldn’t believe that her baby had grown so quickly, and she noted that she was over the moon to have raised such a healthy and happy little girl. Fans were quick to congratulate the mother and daughter duo, but there were still concerns about the longevity of this Paleo lifestyle. </p>
<p> Taking a little breather </p>
<p> From the get-go, Shannon Cooper has always stood by the fact that she will never force her daughter to do something she doesn’t want to do – and that includes her Paleo diet. However, it seems as though Grace sticks to her healthy lifestyle even when she doesn’t have to. When Shannon and Grace made their way to Mykonos in Greece for their summer vacation, Grace was happy to fill her stomach with strawberries and other healthy treats. She’s been able to make healthy fun. </p>
<p> Room for more </p>
<p> Although the Paleo diet largely consists of fruit, vegetables, and meat, Shannon knows that those foods can often get pretty boring. In fact, she knows there is always room for more – especially when she has a craving for sweetness. She often shares her sweet recipes for her fans on Instagram, and it’s fair to say that her “Nut-Free No-Bake Fig & Quinoa Bars” always go down a treat. In Shannon’s eyes, there’s always room for something to round off a meal on the Paleo diet. </p>
<p> Not just food </p>
<p> However, the Paleo diet isn’t all about what you are and aren’t putting into your body. To follow Paleo accurately you need to adapt to the whole lifestyle, and Shannon often writes about this on her website and through her social media channels. She will often meditate, and she will even use natural remedies to help with her sleeping patterns and her beauty regime. She hopes that her daughter will continue to follow in her footsteps as she gets older, and continue to live this way. </p>
<p> Sharing the experience </p>
<p> One of the main reasons why Shannon feels so positively about Grace’s Paleo diet is because they are sharing the experience together. They are able to bond over something extraordinary, and Shannon is being as open and honest about the lifestyle as possible. She informs Grace of everything she is cooking or baking because she wants Grace to make her own decisions as she gets older. Of course, Shannon hopes that Grace will choose to stick with the Paleo diet, but she will not force her. </p>
<p> Tried and tested brands </p>
<p> Now that Shannon has been living the Paleo lifestyle for almost a decade, she feels as though she has tried and tested numerous companies that all promote a healthy way of life. She has been able to whittle down those that don’t quite hit the mark, and she has been able to determine which ones would be beneficial to her and her daughter’s lifestyle. These include beauty brands, fitness brands, and even a brand of organic coffee that Shannon just can’t get enough of. </p>
<p> Writing everything down </p>
<p> Because Shannon is passionate about living a healthy life, she has decided to make it easier for others to follow her tips and tricks. She has written everything she knows down and has made them into three ebooks that can be bought by those wishing to change their health and wellbeing for the better. Within these books, she writes all of her yummy recipes that all follow the Paleo diet, and she tries to make it easier for people to get rid of “poisonous” food. </p>
<p> Traveling the country </p>
<p> Yet, Shannon’s helping hands don’t stop there. As well as releasing her own books, updating her website, and inspiring others on social media, Shannon has also decided to meet fans in person. Today, she travels around the country and sets up workshops and demonstrations for those who want to get into the Paleo lifestyle. She shows them how they can make these changes in their lives, and she gives them firsthand knowledge of her own experiences on the diet. </p>
<p> The perfect pairing </p>
<p> Although many believe that Shannon focuses too much on the Paleo diet in her family, that just isn’t the case. Shannon makes sure that she always has mother-daughter time to truly enjoy their lives together. Shannon and Grace love nothing more than getting into their matching unicorn pajamas and chilling out on the couch. It’s during these moments that she gets to really learn and grow with her daughter, outside of the kitchen. It’s also during these moments that she makes sure her daughter is happy. </p>
<p> Positive feedback </p>
<p> There are many critics who still believe that Shannon should not be getting her young daughter to live a Paleo lifestyle, but it’s fair to say that her knowledge has also not gone unnoticed. Her website, myfoodreligion, is constantly inundated with positive feedback from those who have used her information to transform their own lives. Thanks to this, Shannon feels even more inspired to continue sharing her Paleo journey with the rest of the world – and this includes Grace’s journey. </p>
<p> Striving to be healthy </p>
<p> As a new mother, Shannon had a new priority in her life. Grace was her pride and joy, and she would do anything to keep her out of harm’s way. Because of this, she knew that she would have to make some sacrifices in terms of her eating habits. She didn’t want her daughter to be around anything that was going to stunt her growth or development, and decided to devise a special diet for her newborn. Shannon was determined to stick to it. </p>
<p> Good for gut health </p>
<p> Of course, Grace wasn’t put on a diet because she was overweight. Shannon decided to put her daughter on the Paleo diet because she had followed the same diet throughout much of her life. When Shannon first heard about the Paleo diet, she was impressed with the fact that it was so good for the health of your gut, and she wanted to provide her daughter with food that was completely natural. She wasn’t going to let processed baby food affect Grace’s health. </p>
<p> Not for everyone </p>
<p> The main thing that Tina and Simon know is that fruitarianism isn’t for everyone. For them, it’s the perfect way of life for them. They have been able to feel the mental and physical health benefits, and they don’t even have to clean their teeth any longer! </p>
<p> While the couple would love it if more people adopt this lifestyle and see it for themselves, they know that it’s not going to happen. So, they are going to embrace their own quirks, and let everyone else embrace theirs. </p>

<p> Couple Only Eat Fruit And Never Brush Their Teeth For Years </p>
<p> By Jessica Miller, Published on Apr 29, 2019 </p>
<p> One couple truly are living by the rule that they are their own people and that they should be able to live their lives as they please. They have uprooted their home, they have transformed their diet, and they have since made new and impressive changes to their existence. So, who are they? Well, this couple only eats fruit and never brush their teeth, and it’s safe to say that their way of life has raised a few eyebrows. After all, most of us couldn’t imagine removing the likes of meat, potatoes, dairy, or even nuts and legumes from our diets. How can someone survive solely on fruit? This couple has made it work, and they have noted that their lives have become 100% times better because of this new lifestyle change. </p>
<p> Of course, their wild lifestyle changes don’t end there. Thanks to their weird and wacky diet, this man and woman haven’t brushed their teeth in years. This has led many to question their oral health, their aesthetic appearance, and even the smell of their breath. How are they doing it? Why are they doing it? Should we all follow in their footsteps? This is their story… </p>
<p> The life of a fruitarian </p>
<p> Because we all choose to live our own lives, we all know what we like and want to eat, and what we don’t. For some, this means eating what they want, when they want. They will eat meat, they will eat dairy, and they’ll eat anything that lands on the dish in front of them. </p>
<p> However, there are others who don’t follow this doctrine. Many people have adopted vegetarian and vegan lifestyles over the years, and the trend has become increasingly popular. Yet, have you ever heard of a fruitarian? </p>
<p> The couple in question </p>
<p> Well, two people who live by a fruitarian lifestyle are Tina Stoklosa (39) and Simon Beun (26). The couple are currently gearing up to tie the knot and solidify their love, and they are getting ready to do so at their home on the beautiful Indonesian island of Bali. </p>
<p> Over the past few years, the couple has become famous on social media for their way of life. They have shared pictures and videos of their fruitarian lifestyle on Instagram and on their YouTube channel, and it’s fair to say that people have a lot to say about their choices. </p>
<p> A normal day </p>
<p> Perhaps the biggest question Tina and Simon are faced with is: What do you eat? A fruitarian is someone who only eats fruits and avoids all other foods within their diet. Because of this, the couple have to cater their daily dishes to suit this lifestyle. </p>
<p> For breakfast, they will drink four glasses of freshly squeezed orange juice. For lunch, they will drink a banana smoothie made from seven fresh bananas, as well as half an avocado on the side. As a snack, they will munch on two dates. Then, for dinner, they will have two glasses of orange juice and a whole avocado! </p>
<p> A whole load of benefits </p>
<p> To most of us, that seems like a very small and insignificant food experience. After all, they seem more like snacks rather than actual meals. However, this daily diet provides them with just over 2,000 calories, and they swear by the health benefits. </p>
<p> Over the course of their fruitarian lifestyle change, the couple have noted that they have become more energetic, they feel healthier than they ever have before, they look younger, and that they never been ill. In their eyes, it’s a miracle diet that they will never stray from ever again. </p>
<p> Not always been that way </p>
<p> While Tina and Simon have now thoroughly embraced their fruitarian existence, it hasn’t always been that way. In fact, they have only been a couple for a few years, and Bali hasn’t always been their home. Both Tina and Simon come from two completely different walks of life and from two completely different countries. </p>
<p> Just a few years ago they were just like every other Average Joe who would eat animal products and go about their typical 9-5. Yet, they gave this all up to change their lifestyle for what they believe is the better. </p>
<p> The life of Tina </p>
<p> Before she moved to Bali and met Simon, Tina was living in her home country of Poland. She had set up residence in Warsaw and worked as a successful interior design architect. Although she had a great job and a wonderful set of friends, Tina didn’t feel as though she was very happy in her life. </p>
<p> She knew that she should be grateful for what she had around her, but there was always something that pulled her back down to earth. No matter how successful she became, Tina never felt comfortable in her own body. </p>
<p> A binge eater </p>
<p> During an interview with the Daily Mail, Tina noted that she had been overweight for much of her life before adopting a fruitarian diet. She felt uncomfortable with her weight, and she tried every diet in the book. </p>
<p> However, nothing worked for her, and she soon turned to binge eating to help curb her emotions and make her feel better about herself and her appearance – if only for an hour or two. Yet, this was a vicious cycle for Tina, as she believed her increasing weight was the reason she was still single, and the reason that she didn’t feel as though she was beautiful. </p>
<p> Making a few changes </p>
<p> By the time 2013 came around, Tina was becoming increasingly upset. She knew that she wanted to lose weight, but she just couldn’t seem to do it. As Christmas loomed ever closer, she aimed to feel at least a little bit more comfortable in herself and her body. </p>
<p> So, she decided to look for a new diet that would hopefully allow her to stop binge-eating and lose the pounds that she had built up. It was this decision that ultimately changed her life and put her on the path of fruitarianism. </p>
<p> Stumbling across it </p>
<p> As Tina began to research healthy smoothies that would allow her to increase the amount of fruit and vegetables into her diet, she stumbled across a woman who only ate fruit. She was intrigued and decided to do a bit more digging into this strange lifestyle. </p>
<p> As Tina did this, she realized that this woman wasn’t just a singular person who had decided to try out a rather different approach to eating. She saw that there were thousands of fruitarians across the globe who had decided to set up their own online community and help each other through the motions. </p>
<p> Couldn’t believe it </p>
<p> At first, Tina was skeptical. She couldn’t believe that people who only had fruit in their diet could be living a healthy and happy lifestyle, and she wanted to know more. It was during these investigations that she realized the people who had adopted this diet looked better than the people she walked past in the street. </p>
<p> They were slim but not too skinny, they didn’t look wrinkly or old, and they looked incredibly happy and healthy. The more she read about it, the more she was intrigued. </p>
<p> Endurance athletes </p>
<p> The fruitarians that Tina found on the internet weren’t just people who worked office jobs or sat in their bedrooms playing video games. A large portion of them were endurance athletes who needed to be fit, healthy, and energetic to take part in races and competitions. </p>
<p> Because Tina was concerned that a fruit-only diet would leave her feeling weak and hungry, she was amazed to see that these people were so spritely and full of life. Thanks to this research, Tina decided to give fruitarianism a go for a week. </p>
<p> The positive effects </p>
<p> Although she was worried that the transition would be difficult, Tina noticed that she felt a difference in her mental and physical health almost instantly. After just a few days her whole perspective on life had changed, and she felt like a completely different person. </p>
<p> She felt light and optimistic, and she felt as though she was “in love with everything.” Tina also felt as though she had more energy and that she could take on anything she put her mind to. In her eyes, the fruit was worth it even just for the mental changes. </p>
<p> A permanent change </p>
<p> After the week came to a close, Tina realized that she didn’t want to go back to “normal” food. She had grown to love the sweet taste of the fruit that she ate on a daily basis, but it wasn’t all that easy. </p>
<p> Because her body was so accustomed to eating meat, dairy, nuts, legumes, and more, it began to crave these things. On a few occasions, Tina decided to give in to these cravings, but she never felt the buzz from this food that she felt when she ate her fruitarian diet. </p>
<p> Becoming more strict </p>
<p> Because of this, Tina decided to become more strict with herself over the next few years. She wanted to become a fruitarian full-time, and she didn’t want to feel herself slipping. As she did this, she realized that her physical body was also changing. </p>
<p> After years of struggling to shed her excess weight, Tina found the weight just fell off her as the adopted the fruitarian lifestyle. She became happier in herself and her outward appearance, and she felt so much lighter. It was what she had always dreamed of. </p>
<p> Losing the weight </p>
<p> Within just a few months of ditching normal cooked food for a raw fruitarian diet, Tina lost a huge amount of weight. She went from weighing 183 pounds to 113 pounds, and she dropped four dress sizes. </p>
<p> Although many years have passed since that initial weight loss, Tina has found that she has not regained any of that weight since. She has noted that she can eat as much fruit as she wants, and even eat as much as her fiancé, but she knows that there is little chance of her ever gaining this weight back. </p>
<p> Finding something new </p>
<p> After two years of living a strict fruitarian diet, Tina was more confident than ever that it was the lifestyle for her. Not only did she enjoy the fruit that she was eating, but she felt better than she had ever felt in her life – and that was all down to her food intake. </p>
<p> However, she found that her fruit options were limited in her home country of Poland. She was getting bored of the same fruit every single day, and she wanted to try something more exotic. So, she decided to quit her job, pack her bags, and book a one-way flight to Bali. </p>
<p> Documenting her life </p>
<p> Moving to Bali was a big step for the interior design architect, but she wanted to dedicate her life to her fruitarian existence without the interruption of the Western world – and Bali was the place to do that. Yet, she didn’t want to cut herself off completely. </p>
<p> To keep in touch with other fruitarians across the globe, Tina decided to set up social media accounts for herself. She created a YouTube channel where others could follow her new life, and she even started an Instagram page to document her everyday actions. </p>
<p> On his own journey </p>
<p> It was through these social media channels that she first laid eyes on her now-fiancé, Simon. Like her, he was on his own journey into the realm of fruitarianism, and he was intrigued by her life. However, Simon was not from Poland or Bali. </p>
<p> He was born in Izegem in Belgium, and his upbringing had been very different. Unlike Tina, he had not struggled with his weight or struggled with his eating habits over the years. He instead wanted to transform his body so that he would be in peak condition, but he just didn’t know how. </p>
<p> A keen athlete </p>
<p> As a keen athlete, Simon had always been active in terms of his physical health. He was the kind of person who wanted to push his athletic ability to the limit and wanted to see just how far he could go. </p>
<p> Because he wanted his body to be as healthy as can be, Simon decided to adopt a vegan lifestyle during his late teens and early 20s. He removed all traces of animal product from his diet and tried to eat as organically as possible. This seemed to work for him, so he decided to maintain this lifestyle. </p>
<p> Looking for inspiration </p>
<p> When Simon was in his final year of college, he signed himself up for a local marathon race. He was determined to push his body and achieve his personal best, so tried to find inspiration online. </p>
<p> The athlete often found solace in others who were going through the same journey as him, but he also loved to watch those who had already reached their goals. He had athletic idols, and he looked to them for guidance and advice within his own journey. It was during this investigation that he came across a specific athlete. </p>
<p> A truck full of fruit </p>
<p> As Simon continued to watch videos online, he stumbled upon a marathon runner by the name of Michael Arnstein. Although Michael is known for being an impressive runner who loves to showcase his talent, he’s also known for being a fruitarian. </p>
<p> Simon only realized this when he saw the athlete stock up on watermelon and bananas for one of his races. Arnstein placed the fruit on a truck and had it follow him during an ultra-marathon. Simon was intrigued and decided to investigate further. </p>
<p> Open to making changes </p>
<p> The Belgian native was amazed to see that Michael was so successful even after removing the likes of protein from his diet, and could see that the athlete wasn’t struggling. He looked in peak health, and he looked as though he had all the energy in the world to complete his ultra-marathon. </p>
<p> Because Simon himself was open to making changes to his diet for the sake of his health and fitness, he decided to give fruitarianism a go. In that instant, he decided that fruitarianism was the way forward. </p>
<p> Changing it overnight </p>
<p> Simon changed his diet overnight and made the decision to never go back to normal food. He was ready and willing to make the sacrifice for his health, and he was ready to make these drastic changes for the sake of his athleticism. </p>
<p> Because he loved to see what other people were doing in their lives, he soon found the large community of fruitarians online and tried to find help and guidance from them. It was during this round-up on social media platforms that he stumbled across Tina’s profile. </p>
<p> Messaging her </p>
<p> Simon was impressed with Tina’s dedication to fruitarianism, and he also couldn’t deny the fact that he was attracted to her. He decided to reach out to her on Instagram and sent her a message, asking about her life and her dietary habits. </p>
<p> Tina replied to him, and they soon began sending messages back and forth for many months. After six months of talking online, Simon realized that he wanted to take things to the next level with Tina, and she wanted to actually meet her in person. So, he flew to Bali. </p>
<p> Falling in love </p>
<p> Both Tina and Simon were excited to meet each other in person, and they immediately that they had a connection. Not only did they have a romantic connection, but they also had similar views when it came to their thoughts and beliefs on the world. </p>
<p> They were both interested in fruitarianism, and they both wanted to explore some of the most delicious fruits in the world while also living as happily and healthily as possible. Before too long, they fell in love and decided to build their life together in Bali. </p>
<p> An impressive connection </p>
<p> After falling in love and realizing that they didn’t want to part ways, Simon decided to join Tina in Bali. They have since made it their mission to travel around the island and try out some of the most delicious and exotic fruits that are on offer, and they are documenting the whole thing on social media. </p>
<p> They call themselves @fit_shortie_eats on Instagram, and they have nearly 50,000 followers! As if that wasn’t enough, the couple also films regular videos for their YouTube channel of the same name, which has over 54,000 subscribers. </p>
<p> A cure for wellness </p>
<p> Simon and Tina now spend their days advocating the fruitarian lifestyle, and one of the biggest reasons for this is because they believe it is the healthiest diet on offer. In fact, they believe that a fruitarian diet can actually cure diseases and medical conditions. </p>
<p> During an interview with the Daily Mail, Tina noted that eating a fruit-only diet can help to cure depression as well as many other mental illnesses, such as anxiety. As if that wasn’t enough, they also believe that it can cure digestive issues and even cancer. </p>
<p> No scientific evidence </p>
<p> Of course, many scientists and nutritionists have criticized the couple for their way of life, and have noted that nothing can cure cancer or other similar diseases. These experts have noted that there is no scientific evidence to support their claims, but Tina and Simon don’t need evidence for their lifestyle. </p>
<p> They believe that they are living proof that fruitarianism is good for you, and that this lifestyle change can be beneficial to your health. They have also noted that they have known fruitarians who have cured their cancer through their fruit-only diet. </p>
<p> Connected to nature </p>
<p> More than anything, the couple believes that their fruitarian lifestyle brings them closer to nature. They feel as though they are connected to Mother Earth, and believe that it is their mission to taste all of Her fruits. In their eyes, the more exotic, the better! </p>
<p> Because of this, they spend most of their days foraging around the rainforest near to their home. They create videos of what they search for, how they forage for them, and what these fruits look like when they are cut open. It’s safe to say that these videos garner a lot of attention. </p>
<p> Sharing their stories </p>
<p> As well as sharing their own experiences of living as fruitarians, Tina and Simon also share other stories on their social media profiles. They like to share the experiences of other fruitarians, and state how changing up their diets have changed their lives for the better. </p>
<p> They hope that this will persuade others to do their research and make a few changes to their own food habits because they aren’t the only ones who have experienced physical and mental benefits. Alongside this, they also love to congratulate their fellow fruit-lovers. </p>
<p> Monetary benefits </p>
<p> In Tina and Simon’s eyes, the benefits of a fruitarian lifestyle have impacted their lives in more ways than they can count. They feel happier, they feel healthier, and they feel on top of the world. However, this isn’t the only way the fruitarian diet has changed their lives. </p>
<p> Eating only fruit also has monetary benefits for the couple, as they do not require a kitchen or any appliances to cook their food. As if that wasn’t enough, they also rarely have to shell out money on food because they forage for it. Because of this, they live a very minimalist lifestyle. </p>
<p> Saving money </p>
<p> The couple doesn’t just save money on food, though. They also save money on buying toothbrushes and toothpaste, because they don’t brush their teeth! It may sound strange to many of us, but the couple have avoided brushing their teeth since moving to Bali because they don’t feel the need to. </p>
<p> In their opinion, their teeth and gums are as healthy as can be, and they don’t need any outside fluoride or brushing to do what Mother Nature can do on Her own. So, does that mean they have dirty teeth? </p>
<p> High sugar content </p>
<p> Because the couple relies on fruits that are high in natural sugars, you might think that Tina and Simon would have rotten teeth that would be in desperate need of a trip to the dentist. However, that isn’t the case. The couple are of the opinion that the high levels of fiber in their diet cleans their teeth for them. </p>
<p> They believe that these fruits rid their teeth and gums of any dirt or decay, and leave them looking and feeling sparkling clean. To make sure that this was the case, Tina even went to the dentist a few years after her fruitarian transformation. </p>
<p> Going for a check-up </p>
<p> After a few years of only eating fruit, Tina made her way to the dentist for him to check out what was going on with her gums. He was amazed to see the health and the quality of her teeth, and couldn’t believe that she had achieved such a result without brushing her teeth at all. </p>
<p> In fact, Tina told the Daily Mail that the dentist had to call in his colleagues to take a look inside her mouth. They just couldn’t get their heads around the fact that her teeth were so perfect. </p>
<p> Not the same </p>
<p> Although Tina would love to inspire any fruitarian to ditch the toothbrush and to ditch brushing twice a day, she does have a few words of warning. Not brushing your teeth only works if you are going to eat raw and fresh fruit all day. </p>
<p> It’s not the same if you eat dried fruit, because this dry food can stick to your gums and rot while in your teeth. Because of this, you need to make sure that you are eating as fresh as possible – just as she is. </p>
<p> Trying something new </p>
<p> Despite the fact that Tina and Simon are extremely content with their fruitarian lifestyle in Bali, they are constantly on the lookout for something more exciting. They travel around the country and the rest of the world in search of new fruits that will tickle their taste buds and become a staple in their lives. </p>
<p> They have made it their mission to find the most exotic fruit in the world, and they also make sure that they try the best quality. They base their diet on what’s in season, and what fruit will be as high quality as possible. </p>
<p> A new addition </p>
<p> For many years, Tina and Simon have only had to think about themselves. They have only had to provide for themselves, and they have only had to forage for themselves. However, this all changed in 2018 when the couple discovered that they were expecting a baby. </p>
<p> They were over the moon with the news, and it’s fair to say that their followers were also excited for the new addition. Tina maintained her fruitarian diet throughout her pregnancy and even created special pregnancy-related videos for their popular YouTube channel. </p>
<p> Raising him the same </p>
<p> Tina and Simon welcomed baby Leo into the world on March 30th, 2019. The couple instantly fell in love with their little one, but they were also inundated with comments from people across the globe. </p>
<p> These people wanted to know if the couple were planning on raising their child on their fruitarian lifestyle, and it didn’t take them long to answer. The couple have no doubt about the fact that they will raise their child solely on a fruit diet, as they believe it’s the healthiest diet for him. </p>
<p> Ignoring the haters </p>
<p> Of course, this decision has not come without controversy. Since making the transition into fruitarianism – and especially since welcoming Leo into the world – they have been overwhelmed with negative comments. </p>
<p> Many believe that it’s wrong of the couple to force such a lifestyle on their baby, and there are even some who have called their decision child abuse. For the most part, Tina and Simon ignore the haters and brush the comments off. They let them slide off them like water off a duck’s back. </p>
<p> Not for everyone </p>
<p> The main thing that Tina and Simon know is that fruitarianism isn’t for everyone. For them, it’s the perfect way of life for them. They have been able to feel the mental and physical health benefits, and they don’t even have to clean their teeth any longer! </p>
<p> While the couple would love it if more people adopt this lifestyle and see it for themselves, they know that it’s not going to happen. So, they are going to embrace their own quirks, and let everyone else embrace theirs. </p>

<p> Just got your COVID-19 vaccine? Here's a handy meal plan to follow after your first jab </p>
<p> Vogue's guide to all the health practices and diet plan to keep in mind post-vaccination for a speedy recovery </p>
<p> Friends who have got their first dose of the vaccine against COVID-19 have been your go-to for all kinds of questions on how it feels after the prick. You’ve probably also made mental notes on how you’ll deal with it when your time comes. Some have saved screenshots of influencers who have been sharing a second-by-second account of what it felt like after the first jab. While vaccines are certainly the good news, post-symptoms like mild fever, body ache and nausea—may put you out of business for a couple of days. We chat with Mumbai-based general physician Dr Seema Parekh Sampat about the importance of a good diet in aiding speedy recovery. “Post the vaccine, everyone is kept under observation for around an hour to see if there are any sudden symptoms, but even after you’re home, the first 72 hours after the dose are crucial as that’s when the side effects show up,” says Dr Parekh Sampat. She suggests a handy guide to follow so you’re back to feeling back to normal in no time. </p>
<p> 1. What to eat before getting the COVID-19 vaccine </p>
<p> “One day prior to the vaccine appointment, eat a meal that is hearty and healthy and not too greasy or spicy,” she says. Dr Parekh Sampat recommends eating a filling meal like a wrap, vegetables and paratha, quinoa and curry, vegetable and rice or warm zoodles the night before your vaccination. “Eat an early dinner and sleep well. In the morning, eat well like a dosa, upma, poha which is loaded with vegetables. Include milk and fruits, and avoid caffeine if you can,” she adds. </p>
<p> 2. Keep the hydration levels high </p>
<p> “Three litres of water a day, prior and also on the day of the vaccination is a must,” says Dr Parekh Sampat. This can be in the form of fresh coconut water, dal, wheat porridge, soup and even water-rich fruits like watermelon and muskmelon. “Muscles tend to shrink post the jab and maintaining good water intake will nullify that effect,” she says. </p>
<p> 3. Your first meal post vaccination </p>
<p> “Avoid food that is not cooked using real ingredients. So instant foods like noodles, pasta from a packet and processed cheeses are a no-no, as are raw foods. Ensure all your food is thoroughly cooked,” she says. An ideal first meal will include protein (dal, meat or paneer), iron and vitamins (cooked vegetables) and carbohydrates (roti and rice). She insists on cooked food because eating raw food can bring out dormant infections and that should be avoided at this time of immunity building. </p>
<p> 4. Start your day right for the next few days </p>
<p> “Taking care of your body via food will be crucial in the next few days. Eat a lot of fibre at the start of the day,” she says. Dr Parekh Sampat suggests breakfast options like oats, muesli with milk, peanut butter-banana milkshake, vegetable paratha, upma with lots of vegetables, chillas, millet dosa, steamed dhokla or kothambir vadi are good filling options. So are fresh fruit juices that will provide natural Vitamin C. </p>
<p> 5. Rely on Indian superfoods </p>
<p> “Your kitchen is an ideal medicine cabinet,” she confesses. Since building immunity is the number one goal during this time, look no further then turmeric. “You can also make a kadha by boiling a few cloves, cinnamon sticks, whole pepper and turmeric in water. Strain and drink it two-three times in a day in small quantities,” says Dr Parekh Sampat. Onions and garlic are also known immunity boosters, as is spinach. “Besides that, eat lots of whole grains like dalia or millets like sanwa, ragi or rajgira which will help beat any weakness if at all,” she says. </p>
<p> 6. What about ordering in? </p>
<p> If you don’t cook at home and rely on ordering in, Dr Parekh Sampat shares some suggestions: “Again, avoid food which is raw. Khichdi is the first option but if you are tired of it, try a whole grain risotto, dosa, idli, soups that don’t have synthetic sauces or vinegar or toasted whole grain sandwiches without raw veggies. Grilled chicken and paya soup are also good choices.” Dairy and meats are loaded with Vitamin B12 which is needed for speedy recovery so include them too." </p>
<p> 7. Avoid spicy food </p>
<p> “Some people have experienced reflux after the first dose, and spicy food is known to exaggerate acidity,” she says. However, drinking kadha made of whole spices is okay, she adds. “When too many masalas are mixed with oil, they tend to make digestion hard and increase nausea. So avoid that” says Dr Parekh Sampat. </p>
<p> 8. Other health hygiene to practice </p>
<p> “For two weeks your immune system is not at its peak, so being more guarded during this time is crucial,” she says. Follow a good sleep cycle of eight hours, afternoon naps if you can, eat every two hours, have less screen time and practise breathing exercises. Besides that, she says, “Load up on zinc and Vitamin C supplements, if prescribed by your physician. Avoid lifting heavy weights with the same hand where you’ve gotten vaccinated, take steam and drink warm water.” </p>
<p> 9. If all’s not well </p>
<p> “Within 48 hours, if you don’t find yourself on the way to recovery, it’s best to consult a doctor. Do not ignore any symptoms—minor or major,” says Dr Parekh Sampat. </p>

<p> Diarrhea After Eating: Why It Happens and How to Stop It </p>
<p> Diarrhea that happens after you eat a meal is known as postprandial diarrhea (PD). This type of diarrhea is often unexpected, and the feeling to use the restroom can be quite urgent. </p>
<p> Some people with PD experience painful bowel movements (BMs). In most cases, this pain resolves after the BM. </p>
<p> The condition isn’t uncommon, but getting to a diagnosis can be difficult. That’s because PD is sometimes the symptom of another condition. </p>
<p> For example, some people experience only diarrhea with irritable bowel syndrome. This is called IBS-diarrhea or IBS-D. PD can be a symptom of IBS-D. </p>
<p> In other cases, PD occurs for no diagnosable reason. </p>
<p> The conditions or issues that can cause PD fall into two primary categories: acute, which lasts for a short duration, and chronic, which lasts long term. Keep reading to learn more. </p>
<p> Some conditions or issues may cause a brief bout of PD. Time may put a stop to the PD symptoms, or medicine may be required. These causes include: </p>
<p> Viral infection: Viral infections, like stomach bugs, can cause temporary PD and make your digestive tract extra sensitive. The PD may last for a few days, even after other symptoms have eased. </p>
<p> Lactose intolerance: People with an allergy to lactose, a type of sugar found in dairy products, may experience PD if they eat foods containing lactose. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. </p>
<p> Food poisoning: The human body does a good job of knowing it has eaten something it shouldn’t. When it detects the bad food, your body will probably try to expel it immediately. That may cause diarrhea or vomiting within a few minutes of eating the contaminated food. </p>
<p> Sugar malabsorption: This condition is very similar to lactose intolerance. Some people’s bodies can’t properly absorb sugars like lactose and fructose. When these sugars enter the intestine, they can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues. </p>
<p> Toddler’s diarrhea: Toddlers and young children who drink a lot of fruit juice may develop PD. The high amounts of sugar in these drinks can draw water into the bowels, which can cause watery stools and diarrhea. </p>
<p> Parasites: Foodborne parasites can cause PD. The most common type of foodborne parasite is the tapeworm. Symptoms, including PD, will last until the parasite is removed from your body or dies. </p>
<p> Magnesium overdose: High levels of magnesium can cause diarrhea. However, getting too much of this mineral is difficult unless you’re taking a supplement. </p>
<p> Chronic causes of PD are conditions that may need ongoing treatment in order to prevent PD symptoms. These conditions include: </p>
<p> Irritable bowel syndrome: IBS is a disorder that causes a variety of gastrointestinal issues. These include diarrhea, bloating, gas, and abdominal cramping. It’s not clear what causes IBS. </p>
<p> Celiac disease: This autoimmune condition causes damage in your intestines each time you eat gluten. Gluten is a protein found most commonly in wheat products. </p>
<p> Microscopic colitis: This condition causes inflammation of your large intestine. In addition to diarrhea, symptoms include gas and abdominal cramping. The inflammation isn’t always present, however. That means symptoms of PD can come and go. </p>
<p> Bile acid malabsorption: Your gallbladder produces bile to help break down and digest fats in your food. If these acids aren’t properly reabsorbed, they may irritate your large intestines. This can lead to watery stools and diarrhea. </p>
<p> Gallbladder removal: People who have their gallbladder removed may experience frequent diarrhea in the first few weeks and months after the surgery. In most cases, the diarrhea will eventually stop, but some people will continue to have chronic diarrhea or PD after the surgery. </p>
<p> Dumping syndrome: This complication of weight loss surgery isn’t common, but it can be a cause of PD. With this condition, your stomach empties very quickly after eating. This triggers the reflex that manages bowel movements, so diarrhea may be more common. </p>
<p> If your doctor diagnoses you with IBS-D or PD, ask if it’s possible another condition is responsible for your symptoms. In some cases, an IBS-D diagnosis may prevent some doctors from considering other conditions. </p>
<p> Many of the conditions that cause PD require medical treatment, but these four lifestyle treatments may also ease the condition: </p>
<p> Avoid trigger foods: Certain foods may contribute to PD. If you aren’t sure what your trigger foods are, keep a food diary. Make note of what you eat and when you experience PD. Look for food commonly associated with PD, such as fatty foods, fiber, and dairy. </p>
<p> Practice food safety: Keep bad bacteria at bay by washing fruits and vegetables before eating them, cooking meat to the proper temperature, and properly refrigerating foods that need to be kept cold. </p>
<p> Eat smaller meals: Eat five to six small meals a day instead of three big ones. This may help your intestines more easily digest food, and that could reduce symptoms of PD. </p>
<p> Reduce stress: Your mind has a lot of power over your gut. When you’re stressed or worried, you may make your stomach upset more easily. Learning to manage your stress and anxiety is good not only for your mental health, but also for your digestive health. </p>
<p> Diarrhea happens from time to time. It’s not often a serious concern. However, serious complications are possible, so check with your doctor if you experience any of these additional symptoms: </p>
<p> Frequency: If diarrhea occurs several times a week for more than three weeks, or if you have diarrhea for three days in a row, make an appointment with your doctor. </p>
<p> Fever: If you have diarrhea and a fever over 102°F (38.8°C), seek medical treatment. </p>
<p> Pain: If the diarrhea is common but you start experiencing severe abdominal pain or rectal pain during a BM, talk with your doctor. </p>
<p> Dehydration: It’s important you stay properly hydrated when you have diarrhea. Drinking water or drinks with electrolytes can help you stay well despite the diarrhea. However, if you start showing signs of dehydration, seek medical attention. Signs of dehydration include: </p>
<p> extreme thirst </p>
<p> confusion </p>
<p> muscle cramps </p>
<p> dark-colored urine </p>
<p> Discolored stool: If you start having black, gray, or bloody stools, talk with your doctor. These can be signs of a more serious gastrointestinal problem. </p>
<p> There isn’t one single tool or test that can help doctors identify and diagnose the source of PD. Because of this, they often recommend certain treatment options one at a time until they find one that works consistently. </p>
<p> When a treatment works, it helps your doctor understand what’s responsible for PD. From there, they can continue to narrow down the potential causes and come up with a full treatment plan. </p>

<p> Causes of Diarrhea After Eating </p>
<p> Barbara Bolen, PhD, is a licensed clinical psychologist and health coach. She has written multiple books focused on living with irritable bowel syndrome. </p>
<p> Priyanka Chugh, MD, is board-certified gastroenterologist with a background in internal medicine. She practices with Trinity Health of New England​ in Waterbury, Connecticut. </p>
<p> Experiencing diarrhea right after you eat is known as postprandial diarrhea.﻿﻿ It may just have started occurring, in which case it is acute, or you may have had it for a long time and it is a chronic condition. Learning about the common causes of diarrhea after meals will help you be able to work with your doctor on an effective treatment plan. </p>
<p> Any new or ongoing digestive symptom should be brought to the attention of your doctor so that you can obtain an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Although diarrhea after eating may be the result of one of the health conditions described here, it can also be a sign of other serious diseases. </p>
<p> Acute Diarrhea After Meals </p>
<p> Acute diarrhea is a sudden onset of diarrhea episodes. Diarrhea due to any cause may occur after eating, as the simple act of eating stimulates muscle movement within your large intestine to empty your bowels. When you have an underlying cause such as an infection, food poisoning, or IBS, these contractions may be stronger and more painful than usual and come with a sense of urgency.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Causes </p>
<p> These may be causes of acute diarrhea: </p>
<p> Bacterial infections such as Salmonella or E. coli </p>
<p> Food poisoning </p>
<p> Viral infections (commonly referred to as the "stomach flu") </p>
<p> Parasites such as Giardia </p>
<p> Medications such as antacids, antibiotics, chemotherapy </p>
<p> Lactose intolerance (may also be a chronic cause) </p>
<p> Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D), which may also be a chronic cause </p>
<p> What to Do for Acute Diarrhea </p>
<p> Follow these tips when you have a bout of diarrhea: </p>
<p> Stay hydrated. You will need to replace the fluids and minerals that your body is not absorbing due to the rapid transit of stool through your system. Try to drink water and clear fruit juice and sip broth. </p>
<p> Don't rush to use an over-the-counter diarrhea product such as Imodium or Kaopectate. These products should not be used if you have a fever or there is mucus or blood in your stools. Pepto Bismol may be an option but check with your doctor first. None of these medications should be given to children without prior approval from the child's doctor.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> When to Call Your Doctor </p>
<p> You should call your doctor immediately if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Dehydration symptoms including decreased urine, dry mouth, sunken eyes </p>
<p> Fever above 100º F or that lasts more than three days </p>
<p> Severe stomach pain </p>
<p> Worsening of diarrhea symptoms, or if diarrhea is still present two days later in an infant or child, and five days later for an adult </p>
<p> Know the red flag digestive symptoms, which are especially dangerous symptoms to watch out for that call for an immediate medical consultation. These include rectal bleeding, vomiting, lack of appetite, significant weight loss, fever, abdominal pain and cramping at night, and anemia. </p>
<p> Chronic Diarrhea </p>
<p> An ongoing problem with diarrhea after meals may be due to a wide variety of health problems that have chronic diarrhea as a symptom. If you have one of these disorders, the simple act of eating a meal may serve as a trigger for diarrhea episodes. </p>
<p> Common Causes </p>
<p> Addressing the underlying illness can help to bring about relief from the symptom of running to the bathroom after meals: </p>
<p> Infection: As with acute diarrhea, there are infections that can cause chronic diarrhea.﻿﻿ These include Giardia lamblia, strongyloidiasis, and amoeba. </p>
<p> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Just the simple act of eating can be enough to set off the symptom of diarrhea in some people who have IBS. It is not clearly known why there is such a hyperreactivity of the digestive system in this disorder. </p>
<p> Bile acid diarrhea (BAD): Researchers are starting to find evidence that some people who are diagnosed with IBS actually have BAD.﻿﻿ Bile acids are secreted by your gallbladder in order for your digestive system to digest fats. When these acids are not reabsorbed properly, they serve to stimulate contractions in your large intestine, resulting in diarrhea. Sometimes the cause of BAD is unknown; other times it occurs following surgery or illness involving your digestive organs (your gallbladder, pancreas or your small intestine, for example). </p>
<p> Gallbladder removal: Without a gallbladder, some people experience a problem with poor regulation of bile acids into the small and large intestines, causing similar symptoms as BAD. Although this symptom usually resolves itself quickly after the surgery date, for some people it remains an ongoing problem. </p>
<p> Lactose intolerance: People who have lactose intolerance lack sufficient amounts of the enzyme necessary to break down lactose, a sugar found in milk and milk products. This can cause the symptom of diarrhea after consuming dairy foods.﻿﻿ Lactose intolerance can be identified through the use of a breath test or an elimination diet. </p>
<p> Sugar malabsorption: In addition to lactose, some people are unable to digest the sugars fructose and sorbitol. Fructose is found in many fruits and high fructose corn syrup. Sorbitol is also found in some fruits as well as artificial sweeteners. Like lactose intolerance, fructose or sorbitol malabsorption can be identified through the use of breath testing or an elimination diet. </p>
<p> Celiac disease: People who have celiac disease experience an autoimmune reaction in response to ingesting gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Diarrhea from celiac disease is often odorous, and stool may be more likely to float rather than sink. Celiac disease has serious health consequences and you should be screened for this disease if you are experiencing chronic diarrhea. </p>
<p> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): The two forms of IBD—Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis—can both cause the symptom of diarrhea after eating.﻿﻿ Unlike any of the above health problems, the diarrhea of IBD may include signs of blood in the stool. Any sign of blood in the stool needs to be immediately brought to the attention of your doctor. </p>
<p> Dumping syndrome: This syndrome is most commonly experienced by people who have undergone bariatric surgery for weight loss. Dumping syndrome is also known as rapid gastric emptying because the contents of the stomach empty too quickly into the small intestine. Eating can trigger symptoms such as diarrhea, especially eating meals with high sugar content. </p>
<p> Microscopic colitis: This type of colitis is a distinctly different illness than ulcerative colitis. With microscopic colitis, inflammation of the cells lining the intestines can only be seen when tissue is looked at under a microscope. The cause of microscopic colitis is not well known. Its symptoms include persistent or intermittent episodes of watery diarrhea.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Colon cancer: Chronic diarrhea is not typically a sign of colon cancer (constipation may be more likely), however any change in the frequency of bowel movements has been associated with the presence of cancer. Other symptoms of colon cancer include blood in or on the stool, fatigue, anemia, and unexplained weight loss. If you have any of these symptoms alongside chronic diarrhea, you need to see your doctor immediately. </p>
<p> Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency: In this condition, the pancreas does not produce enough digestive enzymes to fully digest the foods that you eat.﻿﻿ Although there is a test for pancreatic exocrine functioning that involves measuring the amount of fat in stools, researchers have theorized that this test may not be accurate in detecting a mild insufficiency that causes postprandial diarrhea. Research in this area is quite limited. A review found one study that showed a small percentage of IBS-D patients do suffer from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. In another small study, IBS-D patients who were given pancrelipase, a form of pancreatic digestive enzymes, reported a reduction in episodes of postprandial diarrhea. </p>
<p> What to Do for Chronic Diarrhea After Eating </p>
<p> Follow these tips if you have ongoing problems with diarrhea after eating: </p>
<p> Tell your doctor. Any unusual symptom should always be brought to the attention of your doctor. This helps to ensure that you receive a proper diagnosis and therefore a helpful treatment plan can be developed. </p>
<p> Follow your doctor's orders to best manage your underlying health problem. </p>
<p> Eat small meals throughout your day and avoid fatty foods, such as fried food, fatty meats, and thick gravy. Large meals and fatty foods can increase the strength of intestinal contractions and thus prompt a diarrhea episode. </p>
<p> Use relaxation exercises to calm your body. Due to the close connection between your brain and your gut, stress can be a trigger for diarrhea.﻿﻿ Many people deal with a lot of stress in their lives, not to mention the fact that having diarrhea after your meals is stressful. Both deep-breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation skills can be effective in calming your body and therefore offer the potential for slowing down the emptying of your bowels. </p>
<p> Theories on Postprandial Diarrhea Syndrome in IBS </p>
<p> New theories are emerging to suggest that something else might be going on for some patients who have been diagnosed with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Research on postprandial diarrhea is quite limited. Here are avenues that preliminary research has identified. </p>
<p> Postprandial Diarrhea Syndrome </p>
<p> Two IBS researchers, Drs. Money and Camilleri, have proposed three possible causes for what they call "postprandial diarrhea syndrome." They acknowledge that diagnostic markers are limited, and suggest that positive response to treatment of the theorized problem might serve as confirmation of the diagnosis. </p>
<p> They believe three diagnoses should be considered: bile acid malabsorption (BAM), pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and glucosidase deficiency. </p>
<p> Excessive Gastric Acid </p>
<p> Excessive amounts of gastric acid have long been associated with the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A small study found that GERD medications given to a group of IBS-D patients resulted in a significant decrease in symptoms of diarrhea and postprandial urgency. However, this finding has not been replicated. </p>
<p> Small Bowel Water Content </p>
<p> A group of researchers found that, compared to healthy control subjects, IBS-D patients have lower amounts of water in the small intestine and it passes through quicker to the large intestine, which may contribute to postprandial diarrhea. </p>
<p> This research dovetails with the FODMAPs theory for IBS as foods with high osmotic value (meaning they produce higher volumes of fluid) are particularly troublesome for people with IBS. If true, the development of medications that would slow transit time and thus better regulate the flow of liquid into the large intestine may be of value. </p>
<p> Clearly, research into the factors behind postprandial diarrhea in IBS is quite limited, and therefore no definitive conclusions can be drawn. In addition, despite the variety of plausible theories explaining the problem, data regarding treatments for this condition don't exist, so it's unclear thus far which treatments will help patients, and which do not. </p>
<p> Hopefully, further research will shed more light on the subject and offer some effective treatment options. In the meantime, if you tend to experience urgent diarrhea episodes after eating, discuss the subject with your physician to see if any of the proposed interventions would be a safe option for you. </p>
<p> A Word From Verywell </p>
<p> When diarrhea happens right after eating it becomes hard to enjoy a meal. You may become wary of what to eat and anxious about eating anything at all. You are not alone. Many people have this symptom. Work with your doctor to find the underlying cause. You may be able to find solutions so you can enjoy your meals without fear of needing to rush to the restroom. </p>

<p> Diarrhea Immediately After Eating – Causes (Diseases, Foods, Stress) </p>
<p> Diarrhea after eating is a symptom of several disorders affecting the bowel. There is a misconception that this stool is actually the food that was consumed in the last meal but this is not possible. It takes food that is eaten between 24 to 72 hours. Even in cases of diarrhea, the movement is much more rapid but not instantaneous in humans. </p>
<p> Diarrhea immediately after eating may occur with bowel irritation and prematurely triggered defecation reflexes. It can occur anywhere within seconds after completing a meal to minutes thereafter. Sometimes a person has an intense urge to pass stool while eating or immediately after a meal but does not need to defecate. </p>
<p> Reasons for Urging After Meals </p>
<p> It is not uncommon to defecate after a meal like breakfast is that is a person’s bowel habit. This may also be time related. However, if the need to pass stool occurs after every or any meal then it needs to be investigated further. Not all causes of diarrhea immediately after eating is a serious disease or disorder. </p>
<p> Defecation Reflexes </p>
<p> The bowel has two supplies of nerves. A network of nerves that run between different parts of the bowel and sometimes extend to the spinal cord. The other is the nerves carrying signals to and from the brain. Defecation reflexes are like an automated system that : </p>
<p> Fills the rectum with stool. </p>
<p> Elicits the urge to pass stool. </p>
<p> Allows for the anal sphincter to relax to pass stool. </p>
<p> Push out the stool in the lower bowel. </p>
<p> There are some reflexes which are stimulated higher up the bowels. For example, the gastrocolic reflex increases bowel motility in the colon when the stomach stretches from eating food. </p>
<p> Bowel Irritation </p>
<p> When the lining of the bowel (wall of the gut) is irritated or inflamed, it is hyper-reactive. Bowel transit time is reduced as the bowel walls push through the contents much faster than normal. These movements are known as peristalsis and occur as waves throughout the bowel wall. </p>
<p> Peristalsis commences as high up as the esophagus and extends all the way to the rectum. In some bowel disorders eating and the peristaltic waves associated with it can actually exacerbate the movements throughout the bowel even though the food has not reached the lower parts of the gut as yet. This can force out stool. </p>
<p> Diarrhea vs Normal Stool </p>
<p> While it is not entirely abnormal to have an urge to pass stool after eating, it is usually an urge that can be controlled and the stool is not of diarrhea consistency. It also does not occur after every single meal. However, with certain diarrheal illnesses a person may pass watery stool after eating while in other cases the stool is firm, soft and well formed. </p>
<p> Diarrhea in the strict definition is more than 3 bowel movements in a day, passing of very loose or watery stool that exceeds 200g or 200ml in weight or volume respectively. Diarrhea the stool indicates a problem in the bowel – either the bowel wall is irritated, water is not being reabsorbed from the bowel or excessive water is being pushed into the gut, or movement through the bowel is abnormally rapid. </p>
<p> Causes of Diarrhea After Eating </p>
<p> Diarrhea immediately after eating can occur with just about any bowel disease where diarrhea is a symptom. Often these conditions are acute. However, not all people who experience this symptom has a diarrheal illness. Some of these conditions may even be chronic and a part of daily life for many people. This can be inconvenient and even debilitating as a person is not unable to eat a meal without being close to a toilet. </p>
<p> Irritable bowel syndrome </p>
<p> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and more specifically the diarrhea-predominant variety is a common reason for diarrhea after eating a meal. IBS is a functional bowel disorder where the exact cause is unknown and there is no underlying disease process. In diarrhea-predominant IBS, the movement through the bowels is fast than normal. </p>
<p> Food poisoning </p>
<p> Food poisoning is where the lining of the gut is irritated and inflamed after exposure to toxins in foods. These toxins may be produced by microbes like bacteria, are naturally occurring poisons within certain foods, are artificial irritants that have contaminated food and water. The inflammation from these toxins may affect any part of the gut but usually affects the intestines. </p>
<p> Gastroenteritis </p>
<p> Gastroenteritis is irritation of the stomach, small and large intestine most commonly caused by a viral infection. It is commonly referred to as the ‘stomach flu’ or ‘tummy bug’. Bacteria and protozoa may also cause gastroenteritis. It is self limiting and usually resolves quickly. Gastroenteritis tends to be more common among children and spread quickly among them. </p>
<p> Inflammatory bowel disease </p>
<p> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease where the bowel walls are inflamed and may become ulcerated. IBD is a chronic bowel disease with acute episodes arising every now and then. It is usually during the acute episodes when diarrhea immediately after eating is seen. This is more likely to occur with ulcerative colitis. </p>
<p> Food intolerance </p>
<p> Food intolerance is where the body cannot digest and sometimes absorb certain nutrients. The most common is lactose intolerance where the body cannot digest milk sugar (lactose) due to a lack of the enzyme lactase. The undigested food in the bowels often leads to diarrhea. There are various other food intolerances although less common. It may include an intolerance to foods like gluten, sorbitol or fructose among other foods. </p>
<p> Anxiety </p>
<p> It is not uncommon to have unusual bowel-related symptoms with anxiety and psychological stress. Diarrhea after eating may be one such symptom. While it is more likely to occur in people with conditions like IBS or IBD, the effects of psychological stress can affect any person. Diarrhea after eating may even occur as one off episode and never occur again. </p>
<p> Weight Loss Surgery </p>
<p> Certain types of weight loss surgery, like a gastric bypass, may also be the cause of diarrhea after eating. It is more likely to occur with consuming certain foods or attempting to overeat. In these cases the diarrhea after meals can be avoided by controlling portion sizes and being selective with foods. This is known as dumping syndrome. </p>

<p> Find out how to </p>
<p> Did Jesus eat meat? </p>
<p> Answer </p>
<p> Yes, Jesus ate meat. Several passages lead to this clear conclusion. </p>
<p> Genesis 9:3 is the first mention of eating meat. After the Flood, God told Noah, “Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.” </p>
<p> Throughout the Old Testament, meat eating was the norm, from the Passover lamb (Exodus 12) to the quail that God provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16) to the portions of the animal sacrifices that the priests and Levites ate (Deuteronomy 18). Daniel and his three friends refused to eat the king’s food in Babylon, choosing only vegetables (Daniel 1), but this was probably because there was no guarantee that the meat would have been considered clean according to the Mosaic law. Vegetarianism was not the issue. </p>
<p> Jesus says nothing that would change or challenge the dominant meat-eating practices of the Old Testament. In Luke 24:41–43, Jesus ate fish. Jesus also served fish to His followers (Matthew 14), and He caused the fishermen’s nets to be filled on two different occasions (Luke 5 and John 21). The purpose of catching the fish was to sell them so they could be eaten. Jesus also cooked fish for His disciples (John 21:9). </p>
<p> The best biblical evidence that Jesus ate meat is that He observed the annual Feast of Passover. The lamb sacrificed at Passover time was roasted and eaten as part of the requirements of the law (Exodus 12:8). Jesus took part in the feast every year as a child (Luke 2:41), and as an adult He continued the observance of the law. The Lord attended Passover in John 2:13, John 5:1, and Matthew 26:17–30. Jesus would have been in disobedience of the Law if He had not eaten the Passover meal—a meal that included meat. </p>
<p> Mark tells us that Jesus declared all foods to be clean (Mark 7:19). The distinction between clean and unclean foods was among animals, not plants. Declaring all foods to be clean meant that more animals were being allowed. We also have some direct teaching from Paul the apostle. Romans 14:2–3 says, “One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him.” Later, we have this statement: “As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself” (verse 14). </p>
<p> In the last couple of decades, some animal rights enthusiasts have claimed that Jesus was a vegetarian. Some groups have tried to apply Jesus’ teaching about kindness and compassion to animals. Some reason that modern methods of raising and slaughtering animals are inherently cruel, and, therefore, eating meat should be avoided. The humane treatment of animals, however, is a different issue. The answer to the question, “Did Jesus eat meat?” is a clear “yes.” </p>

<p> Colonoscopy diet: your guide on what to eat before a colonoscopy </p>
<p> Around the time you turn 50 years old, having a colonoscopy becomes a routine procedure that is performed annually. But why exactly do you need a colonoscopy and what happens during the procedure? A colonoscopy exam allows your doctor to see the inside of your large intestine and rectum to check for colon polyps and detect colon cancer. Your physician may recommend a colonoscopy diet to prepare you for your procedure. </p>
<p> During a colonoscopy, you’ll be sedated and shouldn’t feel any discomfort. Your physician will then insert a long, flexible, tubular instrument with a tiny camera called a colonoscope through your rectum and into your large intestine. The colonoscope transmits images of your colon lining which are then displayed on a screen while your procedure is happening. </p>
<p> If necessary, polyps or other abnormal tissue observed can be removed through the scope for further testing. You may feel mild cramping during the procedure. Once the procedure is over and your physician has the information needed, the colonoscope is withdrawn while the lining of your bowel is examined. </p>
<p> Did you know? Colon and rectal cancers are the third most common type of cancer in men and in women and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. </p>
<p> What should you eat before a colonoscopy? </p>
<p> While the colonoscopy itself typically only takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete, you’ll need to follow the colonoscopy prep instructions given to you by your doctor in the days leading up to the exam. </p>
<p> In order for your physician to clearly see your colon during the procedure, it’s recommended to follow a colonoscopy prep diet to help decrease the amount of food residue during your procedure. This means changing to a low-fiber, low-residue diet for the five days leading up to your colonoscopy. Low-residue food refers to food that is easily digested. Eating less whole-grain bread and cereal, nuts, seeds, raw or dried fruits, and vegetables helps to clear your colon of residue and ease symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, gas, and cramping. </p>
<p> While your physician will provide clear instructions based on your circumstances, the following tips will give you an idea of what to expect during the week prior to your colonoscopy. </p>
<p> The colonoscopy diet: what to eat five days before your colonoscopy </p>
<p> Approximately five days prior to your colonoscopy, start eating a low-fiber diet. This means cutting out whole grains, raw vegetables, nuts, seeds, dried and raw fruit. You’ll also want to eliminate foods that are hard to digest like fried foods, tough meats like steak, popcorn, and vegetable skins. </p>
<p> During this time, it’s also imperative that you read food labels. Foods like yogurt, ice cream, and cereal may have added fiber that you don’t expect which can make them harder to purge. Unfortunately, when foods aren’t properly digested, they can get in the way of the camera during your colonoscopy. This could cause inaccuracies in the test. </p>
<p> While the five days prior to your colonoscopy may seem very restrictive, you’re still able to eat white bread, eggs, lean meat, pasta, tofu, smooth peanut butter, and well-cooked, skinless vegetables. </p>
<p> When preparing your food, try poaching, stewing, or steaming as much as possible. Roasting and grilling can dry out food which then makes it harder to digest. If you’re craving fruits, substitute raw with fruits that are canned, cooked, or pureed. </p>
<p> Reminder: drink extra fluids during this part of your colonoscopy prep diet to avoid constipation. </p>
<p> The colonoscopy diet: what to eat leading up to your colonoscopy </p>
<p> While it’s not 100% necessary, switching over to soft foods two days prior to the colonoscopy will make your cleansing process easier. Fortunately, there are plenty of great-tasting foods you can still enjoy including smoothies, soft fruits, vegetable soups, and scrambled eggs. </p>
<p> The Colon Cancer Alliance recommends the following sample menu for the days leading up to your colonoscopy: </p>
<p> Breakfast: Greek yogurt with bananas and honey on top </p>
<p> Lunch: Omelet with a side of sliced honeydew </p>
<p> Dinner: Vegetable broth with steamed veggies </p>
<p> Dessert: Jello or gelatin without added fruit or red or purple dye </p>
<p> The colonoscopy diet: what to eat in the 24 hours before your colonoscopy </p>
<p> The most crucial time leading up to your colonoscopy is the 24 hours before it happens. During this time, your doctor will place you on a clear liquid-only diet. This will allow your body to purge the remainder of the waste remaining inside of your colon. While this part of the preparation can be difficult for some, you can still intake: </p>
<p> Water—While you’re spending a lot of time focusing on foods during your colonoscopy preparations, it’s imperative to keep drinking water. It’s easy to become dehydrated when your body is purging itself of so much waste. </p>
<p> Soda—Here’s a trick, carbonated beverages can actually trick your body into feeling full. </p>
<p> Jello and clear broth—Tip: first eat cold Jello and then follow it with hot broth. The warm broth will expand the gelatin in your stomach and make you feel full. </p>
<p> Clear apple and grape juices </p>
<p> Tea </p>
<p> During this time, you shouldn’t have any alcohol, even it’s it’s clear. You should also avoid any milk products. Ask your doctor whether you should discontinue any prescription and over-the-counter medications in the days prior to your procedure. </p>
<p> The colonoscopy diet: what to eat the night before your colonoscopy </p>
<p> In the twelve hours leading up to your colonoscopy, you will only be able to drink a strong laxative prescribed by your doctor to clear out any remaining waste from your colon. Some doctors recommend splitting the laxative—taking half the night before your exam and the other half six hours before your exam. If your colonoscopy is scheduled first thing in the morning, you will have to finish the entire laxative before midnight. No food is allowed during these twelve hours. </p>
<p> While prepping for your colonoscopy may be uncomfortable, it’s important to do it right. This is the best way to make sure that your procedure can be done accurately in order to diagnose any potential problems. </p>
<p> The colonoscopy diet: what to eat the day after your colonoscopy </p>
<p> Colonoscopies are typically performed in outpatient facilities, so you’ll be able to leave soon after your procedure. Since you’ll be sedated during the colonoscopy procedure, a friend or family member will need to take you home afterward. You shouldn’t plan on driving for at least 8 hours. </p>
<p> Once at home, you’ll still want to watch what you eat. Rehydrating after days of purging is extremely important—be sure to drink fluids and electrolytes during your colonoscopy recovery. For the next 24 hours, drink a lot and eat soft foods that won’t irritate your stomach, including: </p>
<p> Yogurt </p>
<p> Jello </p>
<p> You’ll want to avoid the flowing foods and drinks for the 24 hours following your colonoscopy: </p>
<p> Raw vegetables </p>
<p> Corn </p>
<p> If you feel up to it after a day, you can safely eat your regular diet again. </p>
<p> Finding a fair price for your colonoscopy </p>
<p> The national average for a colonoscopy is $2,750. If you’re worried about affording the high cost of a colonoscopy, New Choice Health’s Colonoscopy Assistance program may be right for you. Patient Assist works with a select group of doctors and facilities to provide high-quality medical care at affordable prices.

<p> Diet in Hinduism </p>
<p> Diet in Hinduism varies with its diverse traditions. The ancient and medieval Hindu texts recommend diet which is easy to digest and does not involve violence towards animals.[1][2] Many Hindus follow a Lacto-vegetarian diet that they believe is in sync with nature, compassionate, respectful of other life forms.[1] </p>
<p> Diet of non-vegetarian Hindus can include fish, poultry and red meat (mainly lamb and goat, but occasionally pork and wild boar[3]) in addition to eggs and dairy products. For slaughtering animals and birds for food, meat-eating Hindus often favor jhatka (quick death) style preparation of meat since Hindus believe that this method minimizes trauma and suffering to the animal.[4][5] Ancient Hindu texts describe the whole of creation as a vast food chain, and the cosmos as a giant food cycle.[6] </p>
<p> Hindu mendicants (sannyasin) avoid preparing their own food, relying either on alms or harvesting seeds and fruits from forests, as they believe this minimizes the likely harm to other life forms and nature.[6] </p>
<p> The Vedic texts have verses that scholars have interpreted to either mean support or opposition to meat-based food. [7] Early Vedic texts such as the Rigveda (10.87.16), states Nanditha Krishna, condemns all killings of men, cattle and horses, and prays to god Agni to punish those who kill.[8][9][10] The Shatapatha Brahmana (3.1.2.21) condemns the consumption of beef from cows and oxen as a sin.[11] The Atharvaveda mentions that "rice, barley, bean, and sesamum" are the food allotted for human consumption.[12] According to Harris, from ancient times, vegetarianism became a well accepted mainstream Hindu tradition.[7][13] </p>
<p> While Jha and Bhaduri contend that some of the verses also support the eating of flesh, especially beef, on some occasion,[14] Maneka Gandhi points out that in context, and consistent with other Vedic verses and the Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, the verses have been mistranslated.[15] Edwin Bryant points out that although references to animal sacrifice and consumption of animal flesh is found in the Vedas, these acts were not fully accepted as there were signs of unease and tension owing to the 'gory brutality of sacrificial butchery' dating back to as early as the older Vedas.[16] The concept of ahimsa (non-injury to living beings) is first observed as an ethical concept in the Vedas that found expression as a central tenet in Hindu texts concerned with spiritual and philosophical topics.[17] </p>
<p> Vegetarian diet is favored in many ancient Hindu texts. A vegetarian plate is shown above. </p>
<p> The Upanishads form the basis for Vedanta, which is considered the culmination of the Vedas and the philosophical paradigm of Hinduism,[18] and support the abstention from injuring living beings, proposing ahimsa as a necessity for salvation or enlightenment (Chandogya Upanishad 8.15).[19] </p>
<p> The Upanishads and Sutra texts of Hinduism discuss moderate diet and proper nutrition,[20] as well as Aharatattva (dietetics).[21] The Upanishads and Sutra texts invoke the concept of virtuous self-restraint in matters of food, while the Samhitas discuss what and when certain foods are suitable. A few Hindu texts such as Hathayoga Pradipika combine both.[22] </p>
<p> Moderation in diet is called Mitahara, and this is discussed in Shandilya Upanishad,[23] as well as by Svātmārāma as a virtue.[20][24][25] It is one of the yamas (virtuous self restraints) discussed in ancient Indian texts.[note 1] </p>
<p> Some of the earliest ideas behind Mitahara trace to ancient era Taittiriya Upanishad, which in various hymns discusses the importance of food to healthy living, to the cycle of life,[27] as well as to its role in one's body and its effect on Self (Atman, Spirit).[28] The Upanishad, states Stiles,[29] notes “from food life springs forth, by food it is sustained, and in food it merges when life departs”. </p>
<p> Many ancient and medieval Hindu texts debate the rationale for a voluntary stop to cow slaughter and the pursuit of vegetarianism as a part of a general abstention from violence against others and all killing of animals.[30][31] Some significant debates between pro-non-vegetarianism and pro-vegetarianism, with mention of cattle meat as food, is found in several books of the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, particularly its Book III, XII, XIII and XIV.[30] It is also found in the Ramayana.[31] These two epics are not only literary classics, but they have also been popular religious classics.[32] </p>
<p> The Bhagavad Gita includes verses on diet and moderation in food in Chapter 6. It states in verse 6.16 that a Yogi must neither eat too much nor too little, neither sleep too much nor too little.[33] Understanding and regulating one's established habits about eating, sleeping and recreation is suggested as essential to the practice of yoga in verse 6.17.[33][34] </p>
<p> Another ancient Indian text, Tirukkuṛaḷ, originally written in the South Indian language of Tamil, states moderate diet as a virtuous lifestyle and criticizes "non-vegetarianism" in its Pulaan Maruthal (abstinence from flesh or meat) chapter, through verses 251 through 260.[35] Verse 251, for instance, questions "how can one be possessed of kindness, who, to increase his own flesh, eats the flesh of other creatures." It also says that "the wise, who are devoid of mental delusions, do not eat the severed body of other creatures" (verse 258), suggesting that "flesh is nothing but the despicable wound of a mangled body" (verse 257). It continues to say that not eating meat is a practice more sacred than the most sacred religious practices ever known (verse 259) and that only those who refrain from killing and eating the kill are worthy of veneration (verse 260). This text, written before 400 CE, and sometimes called the Tamil Veda, discusses eating habits and its role in a healthy life (Mitahara), dedicating Chapter 95 of Book 7 to it.[36] Tirukkuṛaḷ states in verses 943 through 945, "eat in moderation, when you feel hungry, foods that are agreeable to your body, refraining from foods that your body finds disagreeable". Tiruvalluvar also emphasizes overeating has ill effects on health, in verse 946, as “the pleasures of health abide in the man who eats moderately. The pains of disease dwell with him who eats excessively.”[36][37] </p>
<p> Verses 1.57 through 1.63 of the Hathayoga Pradipika suggests that taste cravings should not drive one's eating habits, rather the best diet is one that is tasty, nutritious and likable as well as sufficient to meet the needs of one's body and for one's inner self.[38] It recommends that one must "eat only when one feels hungry" and "neither overeat nor eat to completely fill the capacity of one's stomach; rather leave a quarter portion empty and fill three quarters with quality food and fresh water".[38] Verses 1.59 to 1.61 of Hathayoga Pradipika suggest a mitahara regimen of a yogi avoids foods with excessive amounts of sour, salt, bitterness, oil, spice burn, unripe vegetables, fermented foods or alcohol. The practice of Mitahara, in Hathayoga Pradipika, includes avoiding stale, impure and tamasic foods, and consuming moderate amounts of fresh, vital and sattvic foods.[39] </p>
<p> According to Kane, one who is about to eat food should greet the food when it is served to him, should honour it, never speak ill, and never find fault in it.[6][40] </p>
<p> The Dharmasastra literature, states Patrick Olivelle, admonishes "people not to cook for themselves alone", offer it to the gods, to forefathers, to fellow human beings as hospitality and as alms to the monks and needy.[6] Olivelle claims all living beings are interdependent in matters of food and thus food must be respected, worshipped and taken with care.[6] Olivelle states that the Shastras recommend that when a person sees food, he should fold his hands, bow to it, and say a prayer of thanks.[6] This reverence for food reaches a state of extreme in the renouncer or monk traditions in Hinduism.[6] The Hindu tradition views procurement and preparation of food as necessarily a violent process, where other life forms and nature are disturbed, in part destroyed, changed and reformulated into something edible and palatable. The mendicants (sannyasin, ascetics) avoid being the initiator of this process, and therefore depend entirely on begging for food that is left over of householders.[6] In pursuit of their spiritual beliefs, states Olivelle, the "mendicants eat other people's left overs".[6] If they cannot find left overs, they seek fallen fruit or seeds left in field after harvest.[6] </p>
<p> The forest hermits of Hinduism, on the other hand, do not even beg for left overs.[6] Their food is wild and uncultivated. Their diet would consist mainly of fruits, roots, leaves, and anything that grows naturally in the forest.[6] They avoided stepping on plowed land, lest they hurt a seedling. They attempted to live a life that minimizes, preferably eliminates, the possibility of harm to any life form.[6] </p>
<p> The Manusmriti discusses diet in chapter 5, where like other Hindu texts, it includes verses that strongly discourage meat eating, as well as verses where meat eating is declared appropriate in times of adversity and various circumstances, recommending that the meat in such circumstances be produced with minimal harm and suffering to the animal.[41] The verses 5.48-5.52 of Manusmriti explain the reason for avoiding meat as follows (abridged), </p>
<p> One can never obtain meat without causing injury to living beings... he should, therefore, abstain from meat. Reflecting on how meat is obtained and on how embodied creatures are tied up and killed, he should quit eating any kind of meat... The man who authorizes, the man who butchers, the man who slaughters, the man who buys or sells, the man who cooks, the man who serves, and the man who eats – these are all killers. There is no greater sinner than a man who, outside of an offering to gods or ancestors, wants to make his own flesh thrive at the expense of someone else's. </p>
<p> In contrast, verse 5.33 of Manusmriti states that a man may eat meat in a time of adversity, verse 5.27 recommends that eating meat is okay if not eating meat may place a person's health and life at risk, while various verses such as 5.31 and 5.39 recommend that the meat be produced as a sacrifice (Jhatka method).[41] In verses 3.267 to 3.272, Manusmriti approves of fish and meats of deer, antelope, poultry, goat, sheep, rabbit and others as part of sacrificial food. However, Manusmriti is a law book not a spritiual book. So it permits to eat meat but it doesn't promote. [42] In an exegetical analysis of Manusmriti, Patrick Olivelle states that the document shows opposing views on eating meat was common among ancient Hindus, and that underlying emerging thought on appropriate diet was driven by ethic of non-injury and spiritual thoughts about all life forms, the trend being to reduce the consumption of meat and favour a non-injurious vegetarian lifestyle.[43] </p>
<p> Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita – two major ancient Hindu texts on health-related subjects, include many chapters on the role of diet and personal needs of an individual. In Chapter 10 of Sushruta Samhita, for example, the diet and nutrition for pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children are described.[44] It recommends milk, butter, fluid foods, fruits, vegetables and fibrous diets for expecting mothers along with soups made from jangala (wild) meat.[45] In most cases, vegetarian diets are preferred and recommended in the Samhitas; however, for those recovering from injuries, growing children, those who do high levels of physical exercise, and expecting mothers, Sutrasthanam's Chapter 20 and other texts recommend carefully prepared meat. Sushruta Samhita also recommends a rotation and balance in foods consumed, in moderation.[44] For this purposes, it classifies foods by various characteristics, such as taste. In Chapter 42 of Sutrasthanam, for example, it lists six tastes – madhura (sweet), amla (acidic), lavana (salty), katuka (pungent), tikta (bitter) and kashaya (astringent). It then lists various sources of foods that deliver these tastes and recommends that all six tastes (flavors) be consumed in moderation and routinely, as a habit for good health.[46] </p>
<p> This is a typical vegetarian food pyramid; however, many Hindus consider eggs to be derived from the animal life cycle, and therefore are non-vegetarian. </p>
<p> Hinduism does not explicitly prohibit eating meat, but it does strongly recommend ahimsa – the concept of non-violence against all life forms including animals.[1][2] As a consequence, many Hindus prefer a vegetarian or lacto-vegetarian lifestyle, and methods of food production that are in harmony with nature, compassionate, and respectful of other life forms as well as nature.[1] </p>
<p> India is a strange country. People do not kill any living creatures, do not keep pigs and fowl, and do not sell live cattle. </p>
<p> —Faxian, 4th/5th century CE Chinese pilgrim to India[47] </p>
<p> Hinduism does not require a vegetarian diet,[48] but some Hindus avoid eating meat because it minimizes hurting other life forms.[49] Vegetarianism is considered satvic, that is purifying the body and mind lifestyle in some Hindu texts.[50][51] </p>
<p> Lacto-vegetarianism is favored by many Hindus, which includes milk-based foods and all other non-animal derived foods, but it excludes meat and eggs.[52] There are three main reasons for this: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals,[53] the intention to offer only vegetarian food to their preferred deity and then to receive it back as prasad, and the conviction that non-vegetarian food is detrimental for the mind and for spiritual development.[50][54] Many Hindus point to scriptural bases, such as the Mahabharata's maxim that "Nonviolence is the highest duty and the highest teaching",[55] as advocating a vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> A typical modern urban Hindu lacto-vegetarian meal is based on a combination of grains such as rice and wheat, legumes, green vegetables, and dairy products.[56] Depending on the geographical region the staples may include millet based flatbreads. Fat derived from slaughtered animals is avoided.[57] </p>
<p> A number of Hindus, particularly those following the Vaishnav tradition, refrain from eating onions and garlic during Chaturmas period (roughly July - November of Gregorian calendar).[58] In Maharashtra, a number of Hindu families also do not eat any egg plant (Brinjal / Aubergine) preparations during this period.[59] </p>
<p> The followers of ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Hare Krishna) abstain from meat, fish, and fowl. The related Pushtimargi sect followers also avoid certain vegetables such as onion, mushrooms and garlic, out of the belief that these are tamas (harmful).[57][60] Swaminarayan movement members staunchly adhere to a diet that is devoid of meat, eggs, and seafood.[61] </p>
<p> Butter chicken, one of many meat preparations found in the Indian subcontinent. Chicken is one of the primary source of meat consumption among Indians. </p>
<p> Although most Hindus are vegetarians, a large proportion consume eggs, fish, chicken and meat. According to a survey, 13% of all non-vegetarians in India are Hindus,[68] although another survey suggests a much larger fraction. According to an estimate, only about 10% of Hindus in Suriname are vegetarians and less than five percent of Hindus in Guyana are vegetarians.[69] </p>
<p> Non-vegetarian Indians mostly prefer poultry, fish, other seafood, goat, and sheep as their sources of meat.[70] In Eastern regions of India, fish is a staple of most communities. Fish is also the staple in coastal south-western India. It should, however, be noted that in other parts of India, even meat-eating Hindus have lacto-vegetarian meals on most days.[71] [72] Overall, India consumes the least amount of meat per capita.[73] </p>
<p> Hindus who do eat meat, often distinguish all other meat from beef. The respect for cow is part of Hindu belief, and most Hindus avoid meat sourced from cow[57] as cows are treated as a motherly giving animal,[57] considered as another member of the family.[74] A small minority of Nepalese Hindu sects sacrificed buffalo at the Gadhimai festival, but consider cows different from buffalo or other red meat sources. However, the sacrifice of buffalo was banned by the Gadhimai Temple Trust in 2015.[75][76] </p>
<p> Some Hindus who eat non-vegetarian food abstain from eating non-vegetarian food during auspicious days like Dussera, Janmastami, Diwali, etc.[79] </p>
<p> The preferred production method for meat is the Jhatka method, a quick and supposedly painless death to the animal.[4] Among the Hindus of Nepal, annual festivals mark the sacrifice of goats, pigs, buffalo, chickens and other animals, and ritually produced Jhatka meat is consumed.[80] </p>

<p> Do All Kingfishers Eat Fish? </p>
<p> One might think that this question is a no-brainer. A kingfisher must surely be the best in the world at catching fish? I mean, they are the kingfishers. However, don’t be fooled by a name… </p>
<p> A woodland kingfisher throws a scorpion into the air to reposition it. Birds will reposition their prey by throwing and twisting it so that it can easily be swallowed head first. Image by David Dampier. </p>
<p> Although I am not an expert at identifying fish species, in the image above one can clearly see that the woodland kingfisher is eating what appears to be a scorpion, not a fish. Surprisingly, only four out of the ten kingfisher species found in South Africa eat fish as their main diet. Based on this statistic, one starts to question whether “kingfisher” is in fact an appropriate name after all! </p>
<p> A male giant kingfisher holds a Tilapia species of fish in its beak. Giant kingfishers are the largest kingfisher in the region and actively hunt for fish, but also feed on aquatic invertebrates such as crabs. Image by Mike Sutherland. </p>
<p> If one takes a closer look at the fish-eating versus insect-eating kingfishers, there is no really major difference physically. They all have similar body and bill designs. There is however, a difference in their behaviour: the insect-eating kingfishers are predominantly migratory. Have a look at the comparison of the seasonal movement and diet of the different kingfisher species in the table below. </p>
<p> A pied kingfisher hovering directly above a waterbody against the backdrop of a setting sun. Pied kingfishers will hover several metres above water looking for fish to catch. Image by Kate Neill. </p>
<p> The bill shape of kingfishers is perfectly adapted for catching both insects or fish. Although all closely related to each other, in time, kingfishers have evolved to exploit different prey niches. What this means is that the birds have diverged away from each other in terms of what they eat so as not to be in direct competition with each other. This will have caused different species to form over many years. In the process, the kingfishers have developed slightly different body designs that best suit their habits and their diet. For example, if one looks at the largest kingfisher – the giant kingfisher – one sees that it has a large, heavyset bill. This is perfectly adapted for breaking through the shells of prey items such as crabs upon which its focuses its feeding. However, giant kingfishers will still fish, mainly by perching on the side of a water source and then bomb diving in at an angle to catch their prey. </p>
<p> A male giant kingfisher perches off to the side of a waterhole, looking for any potential prey items from small fish to crabs. Note the feeding method of perching and searching rather than hovering overhead, like other aquatic kingfishers. Image by Talley Smith. </p>
<p> A malachite kingfisher emerges from a pool of water. This would have been an unsuccessful fishing attempt as it has no fish in its bill. Image by James Tyrrell. </p>
<p> Some of the insect-eating species arrive back on Londolozi in the summer months, coinciding with the first rains, when the insect populations suddenly boom. This also coincides with some very high temperatures. Oftentimes one will see species such as the woodland kingfisher around the edge of waterholes, periodically diving in. If one was to watch for an extended period of time, one would notice that these dives never result in a fish being caught. This is because the birds are simply using the water as a bath and a means to cool down! A common mistake that people make is to assume that a kingfisher is fishing when it dives into a pool of water. Take note of the species before making this assumption. </p>
<p> A woodland kingfisher sits perched with a freshly caught solifuge in its mouth. These migratory kingfishers eat mostly small invertebrates and insects, but not fish. Image by Talley Smith. </p>
<p> Fish supplies are fairly constant throughout the year – wherever there is a constant supply of water, fish can be found. Thus, fish-eating kingfishers have little to no need to travel far to find food. On the contrary, insect populations spike in summer and drastically drop in number over the dry winter months. This is the reason that a lot of the insect-eating kingfishers are migratory, as they will follow the summer rains and warmer weather in order to capitalise on the abundance of insect prey over summer. </p>
<p> Hopefully now we will all take a closer look when viewing kingfishers around water sources and not jump to conclusions as to exactly why they are there! </p>

<p> on Do All Kingfishers Eat Fish? </p>
<p> It makes sense that the migratory species are all insect-eaters (though the brown-hooded manages to get by). I have noticed, though I’ve not yet seen one, that mangrove kingfishers have very thick bills (like the giants) which I’m now led to presume is because they regularly feed on crabs in the mangroves? </p>
<p> Interesting facts about kingfishers Pete. We have the brown hooded in our garden most of the year. They help control the cricket population. We get the woodlands moving through in summer. </p>
<p> I was aware of just several types of Kingfishers, but totally unaware of the variety of species, whether they migrated and their preferred food sources. I always thought they were magical birds! Now learning that they “toss” their food to better ingest isn’t necessarily the first moment they’ve captured it. I’d reposition a scorpion to go head first too, rather than stinger first myself! Actually … just give me a fish! </p>

<p> Do Buddhists Eat Meat? </p>
<p> There are certain rules and norms that one follows within the Buddhist tradition. Buddhists must know what behaviors are encouraged, as well as things which must be taken in moderation or completely avoided. In Buddhism, there are certain rules and norms that may vary across different traditions. This is the case with Buddhist vegetarianism. </p>
<p> In this guide, we will discuss the history of Buddhist practices generally. We touch on how eating meat is viewed in the different schools of Buddhist thought. We will take a brief look at the different customs with regard to meat eating across the belief system. </p>
<p> Buddhist Ethics </p>
<p> Ethics is a field of thought and action that seeks to find the best and most moral way to act in any circumstance. Buddhism has its own specific set of ethics that help inform the teachings and practices carried out within the tradition. Buddhist ethics is of a set of views that are agreed upon and lived by those of us taking the path towards Enlightenment. </p>
<p> For the Buddhist, ethics and morality play a huge role in the very foundation of the belief system. These guidelines for how to live a right and just life are key tenets across all forms of Buddhism. In some ways, Buddhist ethics should be considered a code of conduct that followers subscribe to when they accept the teachings. </p>
<p> Harmony, compassion, restraint, and avoiding doing harm are huge parts of the ethical system of Buddhism. This extends beyond just actions with other people. When the Buddha taught to do no harm, he did not just mean harm to fellow humans. He meant to do no harm generally, to any life. This extends the ethical system to non-human living beings. For the Buddhist, do no harm applies to plants and animals as well as people. </p>
<p> Main Principles of Buddhist Ethical Systems </p>
<p> Nonviolence is at the very core of the Buddhist ethical system. This is true across all types of Buddhism. To the Buddhist, living a just, ethical, and moral life is a conscious commitment that we make. This means that it takes a conscious effort to live in accordance with the tenants set forth by the Buddha and other important teachers. </p>
<p> Not only does the Buddhist see living by the axiom of “do no harm” to be just, but they also feel that this is the way to enlightenment. A Buddhist who wishes to achieve enlightenment must internalize not only the teachings, but the spirit behind the ethical system. This is what they rely on when it comes to make the right or moral choice in a given situation. </p>
<p> How Ethical Systems Relate to Daily Choices </p>
<p> The ethical tenets that Buddhist commit themselves to extend beyond their thought and relations. These tenets help inform what one should or should not do to make one’s living. They will inform how one interacts with others in the commercial realm. And it also affects how followers feel about certain customs like whether to eat meat or not. </p>
<p> There are many people who assume that to be Buddhist means to abstain from all meat. It is easy to understand why this is so as it is hard to see how eating meat can “do no harm” to the animal involved. The Buddha himself was a vegetarian. He did not partake in the consumption of any animal flesh. For this reason, many followers adopt a strict vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> Vegetarianism in Buddhism </p>
<p> As noted above, in some of his sutras, the Buddha explicitly says that his followers are not to eat the flesh of a being with sentience. This is interpreted to mean that you do not eat the flesh or meat of any animal, including fish. The Mahayana school still follows the Buddhist teachings strictly and prohibit the eating of any animal flesh. This applies to followers as well as monks. If I refrain from taking life means that all flesh is something I should avoid. </p>
<p> You are not entirely forbidden to eat meat across all Buddhist tradition. The popular Theravada tradition allows for the eating of pork, chicken, and fish, but there are caveats. Meat can be eaten so long as the monk knows the animal is not killed for his consumption; he will eat certain types of meat if the food is not specifically prepared for him but rather just offered. </p>
<p> Mahayana Buddhism </p>
<p> This is a more strict form of Buddhism that more closely allies their practices with the direct teachings of the Buddha. In this view, one of the original Buddha’s final teachings related to the eating of sentient beings. These teachings prescribe a very strict vegetarianism in conjunction with the maxim “do no harm.” It goes even further in that followers of this school do not even believe they should eat food that has come into contact with meat. </p>
<p> The Mahayana Buddhist can’t simply pick around the meat in a dish. The whole meal must be vegetarian in its entirety, including preparation. This tradition points to Buddhist teachings and the bodhisattva for their stance on avoiding meat. Spreading compassion, avoiding harm, and so on are not conducive to meat eating. </p>
<p> Monks may not accept gleaned meat (meat that was scavenged). And while many monks rely on donations from followers, they are not to eat meat provided as an offering. </p>
<p> Theravada Buddhism </p>
<p> This is one of the most popular forms of Buddhist practice and this school allows for the consumption of some meat. According to tradition, the Buddha accepted any food offerings that were provided to him. This included meat which he ate when offered. Monks given food donations will take and eat what is given, regardless of whether it is vegetarian or not. </p>
<p> Theravada Buddhists point to his discussing his early privilege as it relates to vegetarianism. In one of the Sutras, he describes his family as being wealthy enough to feed both the family and servants a vegetarian diet. He understood that this is not an option for some and that living this way was a privilege. </p>
<p> Vajrayana Buddhism </p>
<p> This is a less common form of Buddhism, but some adherents to this school can not only eat meat, but also drink alcohol. You must abstain from alcohol in most Buddhist traditions. Many of the practices are only relevant for monks at the temple. For the most part, even monks in this tradition abstain from meat and alcohol. </p>
<p> Lay Buddhism </p>
<p> Many of the rules and traditions described above only apply to monks in Buddhist temples. The strict food requirements don’t necessarily extend to lay followers. Many practicing Buddhists are not vegetarian at all. Some are mostly vegetarian. There are some sects that allow for the eating of poultry or fish, but no red meat. There are many Buddhists who observe a vegetarian diet at least during certain parts of the year. </p>
<p> Other Food Exclusions </p>
<p> Something that may seem odd to an outsider is that for the Buddhist, pure vegetarianism also means the avoidance of certain herbs and vegetables. You must also avoid pungent or fetid vegetables – things like onions, garlic, shallots, and coriander. Some sects call for abstention of all meat, as well as eggs and dairy. </p>

<p> 6 simple lifestyle changes for health and happiness </p>
<p> Does Eckhart Tolle eat meat? </p>
<p> It’s such a curious question isn’t it: “Are spiritual people, truly enlightened people, vegetarians?” And the answer is clearly “not necessarily.” </p>
<p> If you look at the great spiritual masters, there’s no common theme with regards to meat eating. Buddha wasn’t rigid about it and said it was okay if you were offered it, the Dalai Lama follows this path and is vegetarian at home but will eat meat if away. </p>
<p> Jesus fed the 5000 fish and loaves which he magically produced. Jesus said “What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.” Matthew 15:11. And “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.” Luke 12:22 </p>
<p> And enlightened master Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, of “I AM THAT” fame, had no issue with meat eating or even smoking. Here’s an excerpt from I AM THAT… </p>
<p> Q: My body influences me deeply. In more than one way my body is my destiny. My character, my moods, the nature of my reactions, my desires and fears — inborn or acquired — they are all based on the body. A little alcohol, some drug or other and all changes. Until the drug wears off I become another man. </p>
<p> M: All this happens because you think yourself to be the body. realise your real self and even drugs will have no power over you. </p>
<p> Q: You smoke? </p>
<p> M: My body kept a few habits which may as well continue till it dies. There is no harm in them. </p>
<p> Q: You eat meat? </p>
<p> M: I was born among meat-eating people and my children are eating meat. I eat very little — and make no fuss. </p>
<p> Q: Meat-eating implies killing. </p>
<p> M: Obviously. I make no claims of consistency. You think absolute consistency is possible; prove it by example. Don’t preach what you do not practise. </p>
<p> Similarly, here’s what Ramana Maharshi had to say on the subject: </p>
<p> M: Habit is only adjustment to the environment. It is the mind that matters. The fact is that the mind has been trained to think certain foods tasty and good. The food material is to be had both in vegetarian and non-vegetarian diet equally well. But the mind desires such food as it is accustomed to and considers tasty. </p>
<p> D: Are there restrictions for the realised man in a similar manner? </p>
<p> M: No. He is steady and not influenced by the food he takes. </p>
<p> Eckhart Tolle sees life as one dynamic whole; an inter-connectedness, an inter-action, oneness. Life eats life, everywhere… </p>
<p> I saw on TV the other day, whales hunting. They pincered a shoal of fish and then came from underneath to catch thousands in one mouthful. Does that make a whale evil? </p>
<p> Having had my head into nutrition for over 20 years, I’m uncomfortable from a health point of view with pure vegetarianism (and the dairy industry is crueler than the meat industry so I’m told by vegans). </p>
<p> Interestingly, I’ve seen Eckhart Tolle dodge this question many times in seminars and TV interviews. He just advises to… </p>
<p> “Be present with whatever your food choices are and then the right food choice will happen for you… it needs to come from within rather than as something from without.” </p>
<p> This view is perfectly echoed by non-physical beings Abraham, channeled by Esther Hicks… </p>
<p> “Imagine if you could let being aligned be your first priority — a lot of vegans would be inspired to a lot of eating that their veganism would not allow, but the source within them would call them toward.” — Abraham-Hicks </p>
<p> And here is another wonderful and enlightening explanation from Abraham about using/killing animals for food. The clearest explanation I’ve come across… </p>
<p> Safransky: Could killing animals to eat them come from wholeness? </p>
<p> Adyashanti: Sure. Life is killing. If we eat a vegetable, we’ve killed it. If we eat an animal, we’ve killed it. To be a living organism is to kill. There is no life without death. When we die, we’re going to be nutrients for something else. </p>
<p> I don’t see life as “anything goes,” but I have seen wholeness move through different people in different ways. That’s why I’m always talking about action that comes from wholeness, not from division, nor rejection, nor grasping, nor pushing away. What motivates us when we’re not pushing or grasping, not relying on conditioned concepts of right and wrong, good and bad? Is there something else that can move us? And what is that? Action that is an expression of a clear and undivided state of consciousness is what the Buddha meant by “right action.” To exercise right action we must be functioning from a place outside of all egoic self-interest. We must be awake within the dream and be able to express that perspective. </p>
<p> The take-home message from these spiritual masters is clear: Be whole, then see what you do. </p>
<p> People’s pre-judgement on the basis of this issue would be detrimental to their own enlightenment. Because if you saw as Eckhart does, life as oneness, then you would probably also not be overly concerned about any particular FORM, as all the forms are continuously morphing and changing. In fact, there is only life and it is ONE life, there is no death anywhere to be seen! And… life eats life, everywhere. My cat isn’t evil for eating mice. </p>

<p> 201 thoughts on “Does Eckhart Tolle eat meat?” </p>
<p> There is no spirituality on diet. The fact that someone sees someone else, which his mind considers spiritual to have some kind of eating habits, and than wants to imitate him will only end up in disaster for his body. First find out if what these people say has any significance in our daily lives. And find out for yourself if there is some other kind of living. If this clearing that comes through real meditation which is to see yourself without evaluating than real eating will arise. The organism with its own intelligence will know daily what it wants to eat and what not to. So to imitate is to destroy the organism. Only through clarity of the mind will clarity of eating come. </p>
<p> While I am not certain that the eating of meat is wrong per se, the way in which factory farms treat and slaughter animals is very wrong indeed, leaving the animal with nothing but a life filled with pain. This is certainly not spiritually correct. Perhaps I would feel differently if animals were well-treated and then slaughtered humanely, but this is not the case with most of our sources of meat, therefore in my opinion eating meat is usually not compatible with spirituality. </p>
<p> The act of eating another animal in itself is not the issue. However how animals are now grown to be fed is much different than when all these spiritual leaders lived. In addition alternatives were not as much as it is today. Most people go to the grocery store now. Animals are no longer part of the circle of life but man controls when they born eat breathe move procreate and die. We have taken the God role and in most cases are in conditions which are focused on maximizing profit with little regard to doing what is more humane. </p>
<p> If you asked an animal, he would not like what you have just said. The act of eating animals is as important as enslaving, persecuting, and objectifying them. If we provided them nice and livable spaces, but slaughter them at the end, our PROVISION would be false. We did it for ourselves, to ease on our GUILT and bad conscience – not for animals. Nothing feels better than CARE and KINDNESS. </p>
<p> Those who EAT ANIMALS and justify it DO NOT see that they are destroying SENTIENT lives – they see animals as objects. On the other hand, they WOULD NOT slaughter their favorite PETS, because they see them as sentient beings. It’s a CONTRADICTION and a confusion on their part. </p>
<p> Humans are capable of UNDERSTANDING compassion and becoming compassionate. The CAT catches the mice, because his instincts tell him to do so. However, compassion OVERRIDES instincts and lust. This is what ENLIGHTENMENT is. Also, humans aren’t in grave NEED to eat animals. We have other plant based MARVELOUS food resources. Neither have we SENSIBLE or coherent arguments to defend our carnivorous habit. </p>
<p> Compassion does not only LIBERATE animals from human captivity and destruction, but favorably TRANSFORMS their role in this great “circle of life.” We have to STOP controlling this “circle” and the destiny of others. There is nothing greater than HUMILITY. We hide behind fancy spiritual teachings and arguments, because it makes it EASIER to justify our misdeeds. I personally take none of these “masters” seriously. Their times has passed. Next… </p>
<p> Amazing to read this clear obvious reality response, so many excuses for pleasing their taste buds. Very sad. </p>
<p> “I personally take none of these “masters” seriously.” </p>
<p> Exactly my thoughts, Nice work </p>
<p> Totally agree with everything you said and it makes so much sense. Congrats for explaining it so easy to understand. ‘Is whale evil for eating fish?’might be the most stupid question I’ve ever came across to… I am trully dissapointed with Mr Tolle’s way of approaching the subject. We don’t need to eat fish as whales do. We can survive without meat and have the judgment to choose something else to achieve our needs. </p>
<p> Bravo! </p>
<p> Just wanted to say that was a beautiful response. It amazes me me spiritual gurus continue to consume the flesh of sentient animals. They love their cats and dogs but when it comes to chickens, pigs, cows, fish etc no big deal its the circle of life and culture tho and it aided in our evolution etc. </p>
<p> The practical element of ENLIGHTENMENT is COMPASSION. However, without compassion, ANYBODY can claim to be enlightened. Enlightenment is just a fancy, yet EMPTY concept. You can learn it, and if you are a charismatic debater, you can convince your self and the crowd just about anything. We are HUNGRY for new ideas. </p>
<p> However NOT MANY can claim to be COMPASSIONATE, because compassion is DEMANDING. It demands you to act in a SELFLESS way! However, those who eat meat or hurt others are BUSTED on the spot! So, without compassion enlightenment is just the act of SELF-IMPORTANCE and VANITY. It’s good for you, but USELESS for others. </p>
<p> From the point of view of COMPASSION (passion for all or suffering with others) DOES NOT matter what other “masters” have done or thought. It does not matter who they are. Taking them as examples, imitating and following them is only a momentary relief. INTERDEPENDENCE, the master-follower dependency only leads to false feelings of wellness. They need you, you need them – you indulge in each others STUPIDITY. This stupidity is what really is mistaken for ENLIGHTENMENT. Ultimately, you’ll remain miserable, just like most of self proclaimed “masters.” </p>
<p> Well said Attila. I would not follow any so-called spiritual teacher/leader who eats animals and takes part in their horrific cruelty and suffering. Many are hypocrites. Authentic spiritual teachers are vegan and live what they preach. </p>
<p> Absolutely agree . I assumed Tolle was a vegan , I would expect nothing less . His teachings are still based on ancient truths and as valid today as ever . If you see all life as sacred , and all creatures as fellow beings , then meat is murder . </p>
<p> My two cents Human Being are the most intelligent creature on earth so we should act as one. there was a time when human being was not so intelligent when we hunted for food. We are past those time and are now intelligent to grow our own food. So we should act like a intelligent creature on this planet. We know how to grow food and survive. Why take away a life of an animal for our taste buds. We are more intelligent than an animal who does not know how to grow food therefore some animals have to follow hunting protocol. We should not fall to the level of an animal thought process even though we know we can grow our food. Plants do no bleed like animals when they are butchered. More over we are stealing away all the proteins and fats from the meat of the animal that the animal worked hard to build its muscle by eating plants (Take the case of a cow) Cow does not eat other living being or any form of meat. Yet we butcher cow and make beef burgers for our palate and taste buds. we have no authority or right to take away life of a living creature for our taste buds. we can very well survive on plant food and live a healthy life with less risk of having colon cancer or high cholesterol or mad cow disease. Lets take ownership and act like an intelligent creature on this planet. Lets not be a thief and steal away muscle that the animals have made with hard work eating vegetarian food. Lets grow our food and eat and stay healthy. Also eliminating diseases like cholesterol, colon cancer, mad cow disease to name a few. In addition what if the meat of the animal has some kind of virus or disease that effect our health. </p>
<p> Hello Could you please tell where eckhart tolle mention this “life is dynamic whole where life eats life”i couldnot find it.In any of his book or video?? </p>
<p> Hi Priti. It wasn’t a direct quote by Michael, it was a summarizing statement. Hope this helps. </p>
<p> I think it is a matter of personal values in which there is no definite right way. I do not think we need to jugde each other, ask who is more spiritual or not based on if someone eats meat yes or no. We do not know their motives. Of course, there will be people who do not have the animals interests at heart. What those people need is understanding. Room for conversation. Room for explanation. People who live a more enlightened life will understand that they have the power to understand others, despite them being “wrong”. To not jugde someones disability to live according to what they think is right. I think the reason spiritual leaders do not tell us what to do, is because they encourage us to do things from within. That separates them from cult leaders and such. And if you find yourself judging other spiritual people for not being as spiritual as you, because they eat meat or for any other reason, maybe you should aks yourself what it is, that is triggering you in this way. </p>
<p> I don’t believe a truly enlightened human being could eat dead animal flesh . Presumably his reverence for nature and all life , only applies when he’s not eating it . We are not carnivores , a carnivore doesn’t have a choice , we do . And we can choose not to have another unconscious human being kill and butcher are fellow beings for our gratification . Most Buddhists are vegan , and it’s Buddhism he’s teaching . Shame , he talks the talk …. </p>
<p> We are all one and we all give and take from one another the energy is always being transferred from one being to the next because we’re all extensions of the same source the same universe therefore being a carnivore or vegan will make you any greater or lesser than the next being. </p>
<p> I was very disappointed to read nothing but excuses from Mr. Tolle on why he eats animals. Very sad, his book left me with the impression that he had to be vegan. SMH </p>
<p> As all truly enlightened persons perceive every other being as of the same essence as themselves, they would not knowingly and selfishly cause any other being suffering, pain, fear, distress or death. </p>
<p> The idea of a truly enlightened person justifying the cruel treatment, harm, and depriving of life of other animals to sustain their own life is therefore inherently contradictory. </p>
<p> All beings value their own life. No animal, fish or bird chooses suffering, pain and death. </p>
<p> As it is extremely easy now to live perfectly normal, healthy, full, compassionate, lives on vegan diets, therefore we can safely conclude that any person who justifies eating the flesh of slaughtered animals to satisfy their own tastes and self-centred desires is NOT a completely enlightened being. </p>
<p> SUMMARY: No truly enlightened person will preserve their own well-being by basing it upon the suffering of other beings. </p>
<p> °°° </p>
<p> Ramana of Arunachala never ate meat. </p>
<p> Jesus and his earliest followers were part of the Essene community and were strict vegetarians. </p>
<p> The first five Sikh gurus were also vegetarian, as were their disciples. </p>
<p> Prince Siddhartha the Buddha (the awakened) according to the earliest texts did not eat meat nor did he allow his monks to eat meat, not even if it was received as alms. </p>
<p> The Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra presents itself as the final elucidatory and definitive Mahayana teachings of the Buddha. On the very eve of his death, the Buddha states there that “the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of Great Kindness”, adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals found already dead) is prohibited by him. He specifically rejected the idea that monks who go out begging and receive meat from a donor should eat it: “it should be rejected… I say that even meat, fish, game, dried hooves and scraps of meat left over by others constitutes an infraction… I teach the harm arising from meat-eating.” The Buddha also predicted in this sutra that later monks will “hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma” and will concoct their own sutras and falsely claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas he says he does not. Likewise, a long passage in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra records the Buddha speaking out very forcefully against meat consumption and unequivocally in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion that a Bodhisattva should strive to cultivate. </p>
<p> Thank you Christopher for your extremely thoughtful and well presented comment. Is a dolphin evil because it eats fish? I have my head into the nutrition space very deeply and I see so many people who try really hard to be vegans only to have health crashes a year or two down the road. Sometimes it takes longer 15, 20, 25 years as was the case with Lierre Keith who wrote The Vegetarian Myth. I have seen miraculous healings when people eat only meat and stop eating foods that are harmful to the human body such as grains, some vegetables and for some people… dairy products etc. It is not compassionate to suffer oneself for decades eating a malnourishing diet. I also know of people eating carnivore diets who are the brightest, most caring people around. The big fish eats the little fish and that is the way of life. There is no death-free food. </p>

<p> Do Geese Eat Fish? What About The Canadian Geese? </p>
<p> Since geese live on the water, a lot of people do wonder whether geese eat fish. We suppose this makes sense, right? After all, most animals that live on the water tend to eat fish. However, geese do not. Let us explain. </p>
<p> Do Geese Eat Fish? </p>
<p> Definitely! Nearly every single breed of goose has been reported as eating fish. Although, the chances of any goose eating fish will be quite slim. This will be for several reasons: </p>
<p> Geese are unlikely to need to eat the fish to survive. Geese will only eat fish if they have a nutritional deficiency. </p>
<p> The goose is unlikely to be able to catch the fish. There are better protein sources for them (i.e. bugs) that will be a lot better. </p>
<p> They are very, very picky eaters. While they are regarded as foragers, they do not really eat everything. </p>
<p> If you own geese, you will see that there are some foods that they will just never touch. This is a stark contrast to chickens who would eat your grandmother given the chance! </p>
<p> If a goose does decide to start picking animals out of the water, it is unlikely to be a fish to begin with. Most geese will stick with smaller crustaceans. </p>
<p> They are easy to catch and, we suppose, they are going to be a lot more palatable to the geese. You will likely find that they end up eating the crustaceans during the winter months of the year. </p>
<p> That isn’t to say that the goose wouldn’t kill a fish. If, at any time, the goose feels as if a particular fish is at risk to them or their young, then they wouldn’t have any issues attacking it and killing it. In fact, they are very good at this. It is just unlikely that they will eat it after. </p>
<p> As a result, this means that geese probably wouldn’t do well in areas that have aggressive fish in them. </p>
<p> Do Geese Eat Fish In Ponds? How to Protect Your Fish? </p>
<p> If you have domestic geese and a fish pond, then you may want to know how to protect your fish from being eaten, even if the chances of that happening are going to be incredibly rare. </p>
<p> Obviously, geese need water in order to survive. Although, they do not need a huge amount of it. They just need access to water that they can swim on. </p>
<p> If they do not have this, then they are just going to fly away and find somewhere else to live. Since geese are migratory birds, you always need to do your best to ensure that they are kept as happy as they possibly can be. </p>
<p> This means that covering up the water source where the fish is probably not going to be a good idea. This is unless you have one place where your geese can swim, and another where the fish can live. </p>
<p> This often means that many people with rare fish ponds will keep all off their best fish in the same location, completely covered. We know that it will ruin the aesthetics of the area, but it is probably going to be a lot better than having fish that have been munched on, right? </p>
<p> Of course, if the water isn’t covered, there is nothing that is really going to stop the geese from eating the fish. The chances of this are going to be incredibly low, but there is still a chance. </p>
<p> Perhaps your best hope in this case is to ensure that your goose has a decent diet of food. Make sure it is nice and balanced so they have all of the nutrients that they need rolling in. </p>
<p> If the geese are getting everything that they need from one source, it is unlikely that they will need to branch out and eat other foods. </p>
<p> Do Canadian Geese Eat Fish? </p>
<p> Since Canadian Geese are among the most popular breeds of goose in Canada, a lot of people do wonder ‘can Canadian geese eat fish?’. The answer? Probably. </p>
<p> Canadian Geese are more ‘vegetarian’ than most other geese. This means that if they do eat fish, it does tend to be somewhat of a last resort for them. </p>
<p> If you have domestic geese and you feed them properly, then the chances are pretty slim that they will eat fish. We are not saying that it is impossible that they are going to be eating fish, so if you do have a prized fish pond loaded to the brim with them then you may want to keep it covered, but the chances are going to be pretty slim. </p>
<p> Remember; no matter what breed of goose you have, there is always going to be the chance that they will eat fish. </p>
<p> Geese need to eat too. While they are primarily vegetarians, they will tuck into other food if they require it. However, surprisingly, geese are going to be very, very picky eaters. </p>
<p> This means that if you do catch them eating the fish, it is either down to the fact that they are really hungry, or they managed to get a taste for fish in the past. </p>
<p> Final Thoughts – Geese are Vegetarians </p>
<p> For the most part, geese are vegetarian birds. Even though geese may eat fish sometimes as we said before, they spend the bulk of their time eating grass, with a few berries and other plants thrown in for good measure. </p>
<p> If they are in a pond or lake that has a lot of plants growing, then they may also dip their head in and feast upon that. However, most of the food that they get is from the land. </p>
<p> This applies even if the goose is lacking certain nutrients. As you know, the vast majority of animals are never going to stick to the same diet. This is mostly carnivores that do. </p>
<p> If Geese find that they are lacking some sort of nutrient, or if food seems to be a little bit scarce, then they may look to alternative sources. This means that you will find a lot of wild geese munching down on bugs on occasion. </p>
<p> It will never be a main part of any geese diet, but will keep them going during some months, particularly during the winter time. </p>

<p> Do Giant Pandas Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> 190 </p>
<p> Shares </p>
<p> Whenever we think of Pandas, we come up with a picture of a velvety panda in our minds. But do we see it eating fruits? Well, at least whenever I think of a panda, I imagine it eating leaves or stalks of a bamboo tree. That’s a notion that we hold about them, right? </p>
<p> But do giant pandas eat fruit? </p>
<p> Well, after a little insight into the panda lifestyle, we will get to know that they do! Giant pandas eat a lot other than Bamboo, which is a good thing! Although they are carnivorous and should technically eat meat, their peaceful and calm nature made them switch to bamboo instead. It might be because bamboo was readily available, and they did not have to fight for it. </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> Do giant pandas really eat fruit? </p>
<p> Yes! Giant pandas do eat fruits. Surprisingly, not even a particular one but a wide variety of fruits. This is because their carnivorous body, and a metabolic system that is meant for meat need high amounts of proteins in their diet. However, when they are unable to get it, they have to eat a considerable amount of food to overcome their nutritional deficiencies. </p>
<p> In addition to bamboo, they eat many fruits, vegetables, and leaves. So now, when someone asks that do giant pandas eat fruit, make sure that you answer with a clear yes! This is such a loveable thing about a certain animal that anyone would love to keep. </p>
<p> What kind of fruits do giant pandas eat? </p>
<p> We eat many types of fruits, and we know a lot more. Coming to what kind of fruits pandas love to eat, I initially thought anything that would be green and looked like bamboo. But you will be surprised to know that it’s not necessary. This is an even bigger question than do giant pandas eat fruit, and the answer is even more surprising! </p>
<p> The giant pandas eat the following fruits that are so readily available (and human eat them too): </p>
<p> Bananas </p>
<p> Mangoes </p>
<p> Berries </p>
<p> As we speak of it, we can find out that pandas generally eat everything that’s sweet. Once in a while, when we do a little research about pandas, we see wild pandas eating grasses, insects, mice, and lambs. On the sweeter side, they will eat puddings and panda cakes that are made from rice flour, soybean powder, corn and egg. So, probably the bamboo-munching giant pandas have a sweet tooth too! </p>
<p> Do giant pandas eat bananas? </p>
<p> Giant pandas would love to eat bananas. And maybe the banana tree leaves as well. The banana tree, although it is not very tall, but has very long and large leaves. As Pandas’ first choice is to eat something that’s green and look like bamboo, they would love to eat banana tree leaves. </p>
<p> Bananas are green when they are not ripe, so they look a lot like bamboo, or leaves. No wonder, maybe they could sense colors or what – but something green is what they will always prefer. </p>
<p> However, if we particularly talk about bananas, they do so. When bananas are available, they will eat them happily. On the other hand, if we leave them with a lot of bamboo on one side and bananas on the other, they might surprise you by preferring bamboo over bananas. Ah! Pandas love for bamboo. </p>
<p> Do giant pandas eat berries? </p>
<p> Giant pandas eat berries – and almost all types of them. According to research in China, it is claimed that a certain type of wild berry had been protecting the endangered giant pandas in the forests of China. </p>
<p> As the officials paid attention to it and advised the farmers to avoid the giant panda breeding areas, their population had had a rise of 17% in 2017 from 1994. This indicates that these berry vines have provided shelter and food for the giant pandas. </p>
<p> In addition to this, the giant pandas eat other types of berries such as cranberries, raspberries, and strawberries. If we consider grapes as a type of berry, pandas eat them too. So, now we know the answer to do giant pandas eat fruit. They do not only eat one fruit but a whole lot of them – no matter what type exactly! </p>
<p> Do giant pandas eat apple? </p>
<p> If we talk about the favorite fruit of giant pandas, it’s apples! After bamboo, if we see them eating something, it’s actually the apples. As we talked about it earlier, they surely have a sweet tooth for sweet things. There are so many things that make pandas more loveable and cutie bears. Now, things have come far from do giant pandas eat fruit. </p>
<p> We talk about what fruits they eat, and it’s pretty amazing that everything that we (humans) eat – which is a good thing after all. </p>
<p> All the panda lovers out there would be so relieved, happy, and maybe awe-stuck to know that these fluffballs love to eat simple, sweet fruit. Like there is nothing to worry about any particular “panda food.” </p>
<p> Do giant pandas eat mangoes? </p>
<p> If you love giant pandas, and you love mangoes, boom! Giant pandas eat mangoes too. Great, isn’t it? </p>
<p> You can sit with a giant panda and eat your favorite fruit with your ever-loving giant panda. Giant pandas love to eat mangoes. So, summers will become more exciting and cool with mangoes and pandas. This is such great news for everyone out there who is thinking of keeping the panda at home. </p>
<p> Not only mango as in fruit, but giant pandas would also love to eat mango popsicles too. Moreover, they are often found eating flavored mango cupcakes as well. </p>
<p> Can giant pandas eat other food? </p>
<p> After talking about do giant pandas eat fruit, we should think about what else do they eat. Well, we know they eat bamboo and love it, to be precise. This is where they fulfill most of their nutritional requirements from. </p>
<p> In addition to that, you will find giant pandas eating vegetables such as carrots, zucchini, beans, broccoli, and green corn, etc. For this reason, many people believe that pandas are herbivores, but they are not. They primarily used to be carnivores, but with the passage of time, they started eating herbs – particularly bamboo stems and leaves. Therefore, now we can call them omnivorous. </p>
<p> Suppose you are planning to live somewhere with giant pandas and get to take care of them. You would be pleased to know that there is a wide variety of foods that they can eat. This might include anything like steamed cornbread, panda cakes, fruits, vegetables, and meat too. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> So far, we have come to know that do giant pandas eat fruit or not – and it’s a relief to know that they do. It’s great that such an adorable bear-like giant panda is so low maintenance. It eats everything that we have to offer – be it fruits, vegetables, cakes, or even bamboo. </p>
<p> Now imagine a giant panda sitting in the middle of a garden, eating a bunch of fruits such as mangoes in the mid-summer day. Wouldn’t it be too adorable for you to resist? That’s one reason why there are so many people who would love to keep pandas at home. </p>
<p> In short, we can conclude that pandas eat apples, mangoes, grapes, berries, and bananas in fruits. In addition, they have a special menu for the vegetables as well. These include carrots, zucchini, broccoli, beans, and corn. </p>
<p> Not only this, but provided that they have a sweet tooth for everything sweet and nice, they might love a popsicle, or a cupcake or pudding too! </p>

<p> Hinduism does not require a vegetarian diet, but many Hindus choose to not eat meat. Hindus who do choose to be strict vegetarians will not eat any kind of meat, including fish, or animal-based foods, such as eggs. Most Hindus, however, will consume milk-based products like butter, cheese, or yogurt. </p>
<p> The reason some Hindus do not eat meat is because a central teaching of Hinduism is ahimsa, or respect for all living things and the importance of not committing violence against others. This means having compassion towards animals and all living things in nature. Many sacred texts in the Hindu tradition emphasize the importance of nonviolence, and these texts are often interpreted by Hindus as supporting a vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> There are also many religious teachings in the long tradition of Hinduism which strongly advise against eating meat for spiritual reasons. This is because many Hindus believe that in the act of eating meat, people consume the emotional pain and fear of the animal who was slaughtered, and this energy can have negative spiritual consequences. This is why Hindu religious leaders, priests, yogis, and others striving to achieve a higher plane of personal spirituality tend to practice strict vegetarianism. In Hinduism, the types of food a person eats is considered to play an important role in the success of their spiritual pursuits. As a result, there exists a variety of diets specific to Hindus who are focusing on their spiritual development, such as the sattvic diet. These diets are all vegetarian. </p>
<p> Many Hindus, especially laypeople, do eat meat. For Hindus who eat meat, some will still refrain from eating any kind of beef. This is because the cow is a beloved animal in Hinduism, and holds a special place of honor in the religion. Some say the honor given to the cow is because Krishna was a cow herder as a child, but the most common reason given for honoring the cow is because the cow is valued as a symbol of selfless giving. Cows provide humans with milk, which can be used for many foods, and this act of providing sustenance is considered worthy of respect and honor. Therefore, particularly in India, the cow is simply not considered a food animal (this is similar to how many countries do not consider certain pets, who provide humans with joy, to be food animals). As a result, many Hindus who eat meat, such as chicken or goat, will not eat any meat derived from a cow. </p>
<p> Some Hindus who do eat meat will only do so if the animal has been slaughtered by jhatka, a slaughtering technique in which the animal is killed with a single blow to the back of neck. This method is considered in Hinduism to be the least painful for the animal, and thus cause the least trauma and stress. Some Hindu religious texts advise that animals killed through jhatka are thus permissible for Hindus to eat, though most Hindus will still say that it is not the ideal food for a person trying to follow a specifically specialized spiritual path. </p>
<p> Today, whether or not a Hindu will eat meat is also partly a question of location and culture. Many Hindus who grow up in communities where it is very common for people to be vegetarian, such as the south of India, will not eat meat. For Hindus who do not eat meat, their meals will usually consist of grains, such as rice, and a variety of vegetables, stews, and spices. For Hindus who grow up in the U.S., Europe, or even northern Indian, where meat-eating is more common, the consumption of meat likewise is more common. </p>

<p> Top 9 Reasons You Don’t Feel Good After You Eat </p>
<p> Eating fuels your body with the nutrients it needs to maintain your tissues and organs, keep your cells running properly, and ultimately give you the energy to live your life to the fullest. But what happens when you’re constantly feeling sick after eating? </p>
<p> You’re about to dive into a plate full of delicious food. You get started, savoring the first bite, but then quickly devouring the rest, your plate whipped clean. You find yourself wishing you had more. But then it starts. The bloating. The gas. The abdominal pain. A familiar mix of symptoms that make you feel like crap and you have no idea why. Find out what and how you’re eating can play a part in why you don’t feel good after you eat. </p>
<p> 5 reasons you don’t feel good after you eat </p>
<p> 1. You’re stressed </p>
<p> Whether you realize it or not, stress greatly impacts digestive function. When you feel stress or anxiety, your body goes into fight or flight mode, a natural response that increases your heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and tightens muscles. In this state, the gut becomes vulnerable to inflammation, permeability (leaky gut), reflux, IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), and even food allergies. </p>
<p> The fix: The next time you sit down to eat, take a deep breath, relax, and be present while you eat—don’t multitask. This will go a long way in helping you properly digest and absorb the nutrients from the food you eat. </p>
<p> 2. You’re not chewing properly </p>
<p> Did you know that digestion begins in the mouth? Even before you take a bite, your salivary glands are activated, secreting key enzymes that will break down your food. While you don’t really have to worry about that, you do need to be mindful of actually chewing your food. As your teeth tear up food, saliva softens and breaks it down to make it easy for the next stage of digestion, which happens in the stomach. But if you don’t chew your food enough, the breakdown doesn’t happen thoroughly, resulting in more work for the rest of the digestive tract. The act of swallowing huge chunks of food without chewing until your food pretty much liquefies can result in gas, bloating, and stomach pain. </p>
<p> The fix: Be sure to chew your food around 20 times before swallowing. This will help kick off the digestive process properly, creating less work for your stomach and intestines further down the line. It will also make the nutrients in your food more readily absorbable for your cells, allowing you to get more out of what you eat. </p>
<p> 3. You have food sensitivities </p>
<p> If you are constantly experiencing pain and discomfort after eating, it’s time to do some investigating. Take note of what you eat at every meal and log it in a food diary. After a few weeks, it’s time to see if there is a pattern. Does bloating happen anytime gluten is involved? Does gas hit you hard anytime you snack on cheese? Is your afternoon coffee causing your evening diarrhea? </p>
<p> The fix: Whatever you discover, it’s time to give your body a break and stop eating the foods that trigger negative reactions. An elimination diet can help you discover which foods are giving you problems. Starting with the most common culprits—gluten, dairy, egg, soy, corn, peanuts, and artificial sweeteners—your doctor and health coach can help you refine your diet to identify any triggers. If these dietary changes don’t work for you, your doctor may recommend specialty testing to get to the bottom of things. </p>
<p> 4. You’re lying down after meals </p>
<p> While it might feel good to lay down immediately following a meal, you’ll quickly realize it feels a lot worse than if you were to have gone for a stroll or remain upright. This is because laying down puts the body in a position prone to indigestion and heartburn. </p>
<p> The fix: Give yourself at least two to three hours before bed to digest dinner. To help digestion, stay upright after eating. You can even go for a walk after you eat, which research has shown helps speed up the time it takes for food to travel from your stomach to your small intestine. </p>
<p> 5. You’re overdoing it on carbonated drinks </p>
<p> Drinking carbonated drinks in excess can put stress on the digestive system and cause uncomfortable bloating that doesn’t seem to dissipate. Such symptoms can occur after drinking more than just one glass of a carbonated beverage. This is because when you’re drinking carbonated beverages, much of what you’re ingesting are large pockets of air. These pockets can get trapped in your stomach and cause bouts of abdominal pain and gas as a result. </p>
<p> The fix: Rather than opting for a bubbly beverage like sparkling water or kombucha, opt for something flat without bubbles. This will be easier on your stomach and actually aid digestion and ease of elimination, something carbonated beverages don’t encourage. </p>
<p> 6. Your gut bacteria is out of balance </p>
<p> Your gut is home to over 100 trillion bacteria—some of it good, some of it bad. Making sure you have the right balance of this good and bad bacteria in your gut microbiome is one of the most important things you can do for your digestive health. In fact, this ratio can impact everything from your immune system to your inflammatory response and mental health. The root cause of many digestive issues, including bloating, diarrhea, and constipation often ties back to imbalanced gut bacteria, or gut dysbiosis. </p>
<p> The fix: A probiotic is a great, preemptive way to ensure you are getting good bacteria in your system. Probiotics are live microorganisms that restore the good intestinal bacteria that exist in your gut microbiome and maximize your body’s ability to extract nutrients from the food you eat. However, if you suspect you may already have a gut dysbiosis, talk to your doctor about gut microbiome testing and treatment. </p>
<p> 7. You’re not eating enough fiber </p>
<p> Fiber is one of the most important nutrients when it comes to your digestive health, but most people are eating about half of the recommended daily intake (we like to aim for 30 to 50 grams a day). Without enough fiber to move things along, it’s possible your digestive tract could be backed up and making you feel sick when you eat. Fiber passes through your digestive tract relatively intact, allowing it to feed on gut bacteria and push out toxins. And not only does it promote digestion, but it’s also known to keep you fuller longer, balance blood sugar, and regulate estrogen levels. </p>
<p> The fix: Fiber can be found naturally in many foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Incorporating more of these fiber-rich foods into your diet regularly can be a great way to promote a health gut. If you find that you’re still having trouble reaching your 30 grams per day, try adding some chia seeds or ground flaxseed—both forms of concentrated fiber—into your morning smoothie. </p>
<p> 8. You’re taking a lot of medication </p>
<p> Unfortunately, some medications may be doing some harm in their process of trying to help. Take antibiotics—while they’re known to kill bacteria that are threatening your health, oftentimes they can wipe out the good bacteria already living in your gut. And the same can be said for other, seemingly harmless medications like hormonal birth control or over-the-counter pain relievers like Advil. By throwing off that important balance of good to bad bacteria in your gut microbiome, these medications could be at the root of your discomfort when eating. </p>
<p> The fix: At Parsley Health, our doctors are sure to prescribe medication only when necessary, and help guide you through the process should you decide to come off any existing medication. Diet and lifestyle changes can help take the place of some medications that may have been contributing to your feeling sick after eating. </p>
<p> 9. You have a thyroid issue </p>
<p> The thyroid is a butterfly shaped gland in your neck that is at the heart of so many processes in our bodies, including digestion Whether you have an overactive thyroid (your body produces too much thyroid hormones) or an underactive thyroid (your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones), either could be contributing to why you feel sick when you eat. Typically, high thyroid function causes overactive digestion, leading to diarrhea, and low thyroid function slows everything down and ultimately leads to constipation. </p>
<p> The fix: Everything from your environment to how you eat, your stress levels, and lifestyle can impact how your thyroid functions and things can change over time, so it’s good to get your thyroid levels tested annually. Parsley Health doctors use advanced thyroid testing to monitor levels and treat thyroid issues using lifestyle changes and medication if necessary. </p>
<p> Eating is supposed to be a pleasurable experience, not a painful one. If you’ve been experiencing abdominal pain, gas, bloating, brain fog, and irregular bowel movements, it may be a sign that there’s something deeper going on. </p>
<p> How to improve your digestive health </p>
<p> Since your digestive system is a long and complex system, starting from your mouth and ending at your anus, there are many things that can go wrong along the way. We know that how we live and eat has a direct impact on our digestive system and how well it functions. By incorporating these biohacks for a healthier gut, you may be able to help your digestive system function more efficiently. </p>
<p> If you regularly experience symptoms of feeling sick after you eat and still aren’t sure what could be causing it, it’s best to consult with a doctor to help you determine what it could be. </p>
<p> At Parsley Health, our doctors and health coaches will take the time to get to the root cause of your discomfort by listening to your unique experience and symptoms and recommending the proper testing, like an advanced gut microbiome test. They can then work with you to determine the proper protocols for healing your gut, taking into account what works best for your and your lifestyle. Between elimination diets, a low-FODMAP diet, even improving your mental health, there are plenty of natural treatment options to fit your needs. </p>
<p> Final Thoughts on Why You Don’t Feel Good After You Eat </p>
<p> Eating is supposed to be pleasurable, so if you experience regular pain, gas, bloating, brain fog and IBS, it’s time to consider what is at the root cause of your symptoms. </p>
<p> Top reasons you may feel nauseous after you eat include a potential undiagnosed food sensitivity, chronic stress, or not chewing your food properly. </p>
<p> Improving your digestive health will help your digestion function more efficiently and can improve your overall health. </p>

<p> Do Rabbits Eat Meat, Chicken, or Fish? </p>
<p> We love meat, fish, poultry, pork, wild boar, venison, and other animal meats. Sometimes, one may want to share these foods with rabbits. Should we share these foods with them or not? </p>
<p> Should they eat meat, chicken, or fish? </p>
<p> No. Rabbits should not eat raw, roasted or cooked meat, fish, chicken, turkey, pork, duck, wild boars, or any other animal meat or product such as bacon, hotdog, salami, ham, sausages, eggs, chicken nuggets, corned beef, and etcetera. Here is why: </p>
<p> 1. Rabbits are herbivores </p>
<p> To begin with, rabbits, hares, and jackrabbits herbivores. While in the wild eat mainly grass as well as some herbs, twigs, sprouts, tree barks, leaves, seeds, fruits, and other plant material. Similarly, domesticated rabbits derive their nutrients from similar foods. </p>
<p> In a typical rabbit food list, hay, especially grass types, should account for 80%, high-quality pellets 5-10% of their diet, and fresh foods 10-15%. Fresh foods are mainly leafy veggies and plants with fruits and non-leafy vegetables fed as treats. </p>
<p> Therefore, their digestive system is only adapted to handle plant materials, not animal products. They lack some enzymes necessary to facilitate the digestion of meat, fish, poultry, and so forth. </p>
<p> 2. High fats and proteins </p>
<p> Nutritional analysis of nutrition of 70% lean raw meat, fish, chicken with skin (broiler or fryers: </p>
<p> Additionally, some have small quantities of riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B5, B6, E, K, folate, iron, manganese, copper, sodium, and potassium, among others. </p>
<p> Looking at the above table, meat, chicken, and fish are high in calories, have lots of fats, cholesterol, proteins, especially if you consider the quantities on dry matter basis by removing water. </p>
<p> Excessive proteins will slow gut motility, increase urine production, strain their kidney and liver, while changing their cecum microflora balance and pH. Expect enteritis, soft stool, diarrhea, stomach upsets, among others. Also, they will fatten your bunny. </p>
<p> On the other hand, rabbits require only 1-3% of fats, while these foods have higher fats, which can lead to hepatic lipidosis, obesity, and GI issues. </p>
<p> 3. Low to no fiber </p>
<p> Fiber is essential as it helps in wearing their teeth, promoting gut motility, cecotrophy, and source of energy (via hindgut soluble fiber fermentation), and so on. Therefore, your bunnies will suffer from all these problems, should they eat these foods in large amounts. </p>
<p> Therefore, don’t allow your rabbit to eat meat, fish, poultry, other animal meats or products. </p>
<p> What happens if a rabbit eats meat? </p>
<p> As curious animals and chewers, it is normal for them to want to eat almost anything they come across. If your rabbit ate a small amount of meat, don’t worry. It won’t kill them. However, they may suffer from some gastrointestinal problems. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if your rabbit eats a lot of meat, fish, chicken, pork, and other meats and consistently, they may suffer from severe GI and digestion issues, including inflammation or even die. Therefore, also ensure you don’t leave these foods in any places that your rabbits can access. </p>
<p> Reports of rabbits eating meat, chicken or fish </p>
<p> While they are not meat-eaters, there have a few cases of this happening. For instance: </p>
<p> A pet rabbit owner reported that his Fleming giant bunny picked and ate pork several pieces of cooked lamb chops. </p>
<p> The story on previous owned but now feral bunnies New York City eating chicken wing by Dnainfo.com. </p>
<p> Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in Yukon’s Territory in Canada caught on camera scavenging for and eating carcasses, including their main predator, the lynx, their kind as well as grouse loon’s feathers during winter. This shocking case was by an ecology Ph.D. student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Michael Peers, to Northwestern Naturalists. </p>
<p> For the case of snowshoe hares, while they are also herbivores, they don’t belong to the same genus with a domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus Cuniculus). However, the behavior may have been influenced by food scarcity, the encroachment of their habitat, among other reasons. </p>
<p> For others, this may be a case of nutritional deficiencies, pica, or curiosity. These animals have a sweet tooth, just like human beings. </p>
<p> Rabbit cannibalism </p>
<p> Bunny cannibalism characterized by does or bucks eating offspring does occur but on rare occasions. Some common triggers include the following: </p>
<p> 1. Malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies </p>
<p> Lack of some vital nutrients may be a reason why does eat their offspring. This cannibalism happens to help them gain the nutrients and energy they require. Also, inadequate food may cause it. </p>
<p> 2. Survival tactic </p>
<p> This carnivorous tendency may be a survival tactic if they live near predators or sight one. They don’t want their nests discovered, a reason the reason why does may eat their placenta, defective or stillbirths as well as leak any blood near their nesting area. </p>
<p> When they note survival chances are low, bunnies would instead regain their energy by eating their progenies that having then discovered and devoured by predators. </p>
<p> 3. Extreme stress </p>
<p> When extremely stressed, some female bunnies may eat their kits and not because they are hungry. Injury, small cages, the sight of a predator, and so on can make them stressed. </p>
<p> 4. Competition </p>
<p> Some males may eat kits to remove competition, especially when they want to mate again. </p>

<p> Do Snakes Eat Fruit? [What Kind Of Foods Do Snakes Eat?] </p>
<p> Owning a pet snake comes with its own range of considerations. Diet is an important one. You may be have questions regarding what they can and cannot eat. But what about fruit? Where does this fall; is it safe and healthy for a snake to consume it? I decided to conduct some research into the topic. I’ll be sharing that with you here today. </p>
<p> So, do snakes eat fruit? Snakes do not, nor should not eat fruit. Snakes are strict carnivores and do not have the necessary microbes in their gut to process and break down the fiber and sugars found in fruit. This reptile’s gut system cannot support plant-eating behavior, so you should avoid feeding fruit at all costs. </p>
<p> Most reptiles are carnivorous; however, some species can eat plants. Crocodiles occasionally feed on fruits, and aquatic iguanas enjoy eating algae. Snakes, on the other hand, are one of the few animals that eat a strictly meat-based diet. </p>
<p> Snakes are predatorial animals and enjoy hunting after their prey; they get great satisfaction from hunting. Some species prefer to eat fish over a mouse, but all in all, you won’t ever see these animals looking for sweet berries in the wild. </p>
<p> Let us now take a closer look as to why snakes do not pursue fruit, and why it is not a good idea to feed it if you own a pet snake. Then, we will take a look at what a snake should be eating so be sure to read until there end. You’ll be surprised as to what you learn! </p>
<p> Can Snakes Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> We know that snakes instinctively do not eat fruit; they seem to enjoy hunting, killing, and eating live prey. These serpents are dedicated meat-eaters; studies (1,2,3) show that their gut system does not support a plant-based diet; this includes fruit. </p>
<p> Herbivorous animals can break down the plants they consume; they have the required enzymes in their gut to process fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p> The reason why they have the necessary microbes to break down plants is through their adaptation and socialization habits. These animals tend to stick close by to their kin, and they introduce bacteria to one another through touch and their feces. </p>
<p> Not only this, but these kind of animals have a specific digestive system capable of extracting such nutrients. In fact, herbivores have a longer gut is necessary because plant material is more difficult to digest than animal material. </p>
<p> Interestingly, scientists studying snakes have discovered plants and vegetables with the stomachs of snakes. This would seem out of character for these reptiles, but swallowing plants is purely accidental. </p>
<p> Snakes can ingest plant matter by mistake whilst eating prey whole and some plants are known to smell like meat or fish, confusing the snake into consuming it. </p>
<p> Other times, small amounts of plant matter may be inside the prey in which the snake consumes. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, and in each context, not much plant matter is ever eaten nor is inside the snake at any one time. </p>
<p> Snakes cannot eat fruit or vegetables in larger amounts; it is not in their nature to do so. </p>
<p> Are There Vegetarian Snakes? </p>
<p> No, there are no vegetarian snakes, none exist. </p>
<p> All snakes eat meat, some species consume warm-blooded prey (like rabbits, birds, and rodents), whereas others eat frogs, toads, insects, fish, worms, slugs, eggs, and other reptiles. These serpents don’t take dainty little bites- they swallow their prey whole! </p>
<p> The typical diet of many pet snakes includes prey like rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils. If you own a bigger snake, you will have to feed whole rabbits to your pet. Many owners have an issue with feeding whole animals to their snakes, so these are therefore less commonly owned. </p>
<p> Watching your slithery companion eat whole animals may not make for the most pleasant viewing, but eating this way is nutritionally complete; it avoids many of the dietary-related illnesses commonly found in other reptiles. </p>
<p> That being said, snakes in captivity shouldn’t eat live animals, instead, train them to eat dead animals. Dead and frozen prey is commercially available, and you can thaw it and feed it to your snake. </p>
<p> What Kind Of Food Do Snakes Eat? </p>
<p> As previously discussed, some snake species eat warm-blooded animals, whereas others prefer to eat insects, amphibians, and eggs. </p>
<p> Let’s look at the diets of five most widely kept species of snakes, to get a better understanding of their feeding habits: </p>
<p> 1- King Snakes </p>
<p> All king snakes make excellent pets, but the most popular type is the California King Snake. </p>
<p> They are non-venomous constrictors that are only about ten inches as infants. As these snakes grow, they can reach a length of 3 to 4 feet. </p>
<p> In captivity, these snakes eat rodents, but owners are advised to feed freshly killed rodents as opposed to living rodents to their pets. </p>
<p> 2- Ball Pythons </p>
<p> This snake is widely praised among snake owners and the most popular pet species. The reason why they are popular is due to their shy and docile nature. These snakes are constrictors and non-venomous. </p>
<p> In the wild, these snakes wrap their bodies their prey and suffocate them to death. </p>
<p> In captivity, ball pythons require a diet of rodents like mice and rats, pre-killed is best. Feed these snakes every one or two weeks. </p>
<p> There are times in the year when ball pythons do not eat; this is normal; monitor your snake’s well-being and appearance. </p>
<p> 3 – Boa Constrictors </p>
<p> The Boa Constrictor can reach an incredible length ranging between 5 to 10 feet, and they easily weigh up to 60 pounds. </p>
<p> If you are planning to own a Boa, you must plan how you will care for this breed. Despite their intimidating size, these snakes are very docile. </p>
<p> When you first bring your Boa home, you must allow it time to acclimate to your home, do not attempt to feed it during this period of acclimation. Feed your Boa Constrictor, a diet of quality mice and rats of the right size. </p>
<p> 4 – Corn Snakes </p>
<p> Despite being named corn snakes, these serpents do not eat corn; they are given this name due to the pattern on their belly resembling corn kernels. </p>
<p> Corn snakes are not venomous but constrict the prey they hunt. </p>
<p> These snakes have a more varied diet. The infants can eat baby mice, as well as lizards and small frogs. Adult corn snakes eat birds and their eggs. </p>
<p> Mice are the most popular food to give pet corn snakes. Adults must eat once every seven to ten days. </p>
<p> 5 – Milk Snakes </p>
<p> These snakes eat mice and rats in proportion to their size. </p>
<p> Do not feed animals that are bigger than the widest part of your milk snake. If animals are bigger, these snakes will struggle to digest their food correctly. </p>
<p> Young milk snakes must eat once every five days, whereas adult milk snakes must eat once every ten days. </p>
<p> Finally </p>
<p> Remarkably, snakes are perhaps the only reptile without a herbivorous species. </p>
<p> So back to our original question as to whether snakes eat fruit; we know for sure, they do not nor should not. </p>
<p> As an owner, do not attempt to give any species of snake fruit, it will not do them any good and in fact can be dangerous to do so. </p>
<p> Snakes eat meat; they need meat and only meat. </p>
<p> In the wild, serpents devour their prey alive and whole. </p>
<p> In captivity, you must not feed live animals as snakes could be harmed dead and frozen animals are available commercially and are suitable for your pet’s nutritional needs. </p>
<p> While most of us can’t resist a sweet and apple or pear, and many animals love to eat fruit, snakes are just one of those species of animal that simply cant. They have no natural instinct to do so anyway so do not fear that they are missing out! </p>
<p> Related Questions </p>
<p> Do Snakes Eat Apples? No, snakes cannot nor should not eat apples. They are not naturally inclined to want to consume apples, nor do they have the digestive capabilities in order to effectively do so. </p>
<p> Do any snakes eat plants? No, there are no species of snake that eat plant matter or material. All species of snake are strictly carnivorous. </p>

<p> Do Vegans Eat Fish? </p>
<p> If you’re new to veganism, it can be confusing to keep track of the difference between vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians, flexitarians, and so on! One particular issue is the common confusion over whether vegans can eat fish. </p>
<p> So, do vegans eat fish? Vegans do not eat fish, as they do not eat any animal products. The correct term for a vegetarian who eats fish is “pescatarian.” Controversially, some vegans do eat bivalves such as oysters because they don’t have a central nervous system. Otherwise, vegans do not eat seafood or fish. </p>
<p> That’s the quick answer! But there’s a lot more we can dig into here. Read on to learn more about the distinction between vegans, vegetarians, and pescatarians, along with why vegans don’t eat fish, and how vegans can get the health benefits of fish (omega-3s) on their more restricted diets. </p>
<p> Vegan vs Vegetarian vs Pescatarian </p>
<p> To start with, let’s just clarify some terms. </p>
<p> Definition of “Vegan” </p>
<p> A vegan is someone food doesn’t eat any animals or animal products—no dairy, no eggs, no meat, no fish, no animals at all. Typically, vegans also avoid wearing animal products such as leather and fur. </p>
<p> Some vegans may be purely motivated by health reasons, but more often, the term “vegan” is associated with people who have an ethical belief in animal rights or concern for animal welfare. </p>
<p> Many vegans also boycott zoos and circuses that exploit animals for entertainment, along with avoiding products tested on animals. </p>
<p> Definition of “Vegetarian” </p>
<p> A vegetarian is anyone who doesn’t eat meat. Typically, vegetarians do not eat red meat, poultry, fish, or any other dead animals. </p>
<p> Most vegetarians do still consume dairy products and eggs. The technical term for this is lacto-ovo-vegetarian (Lacto meaning milk and ovo meaning egg), but most people just call it vegetarian. </p>
<p> Definition of “Pescatarian” </p>
<p> Vegan Alternatives to Fish: What to Eat Instead </p>
<p> There are tons of ways to replace fish in any meal or recipe to make it vegan-friendly. </p>
<p> If you’d like a recipe for a home-made fish alternative, you can check out this list of 17 vegan “fish” recipes from PETA (it includes pictures) or this guide to different vegan seafood substitutes. </p>
<p> There are also some products you can buy in the store like these fishless filets, which are a ready-made fish alternative. I also believe I’ve seen vegan fish sticks in a store once or twice. </p>
<p> Otherwise, you can also just replace fish with any protein-rich plant food like beans, tempeh, tofu, seitan, or any mock-meats you find at the store, like veggie burgers. </p>
<p> When I visit my parents, they’ll often make a fish dinner for themselves, and I’ll eat the same basic meal but with a simple veggie burger to replace the fish part. Everyone’s happy! </p>
<p> Why Vegans and Vegetarians Don’t Eat Fish </p>
<p> Vegans and vegetarians can be driven by various motivations to their diet. But typically, their reasons not to eat fish will fall into one of the following three categories: </p>
<p> 1. Animal Welfare or Animal Rights Concerns </p>
<p> It is generally believed that fish feel pain. Indeed, in the Smithsonian ran an article titled “It’s Official: Fish Feel Pain.” </p>
<p> Fish have nociceptors, a kind of neuron used to detect harm from heat, pressure, or irritation. They also produce endogenous opioids (natural painkillers) in the same way that we do. </p>
<p> In experimental research, when chemical irritants were applied to fish, they rubbed their bodies against the sides of the tank, lost their appetite, and showed other signs of pain. </p>
<p> From an ethical perspective, if you’re a vegetarian or vegan opposed to hurting and killing mammals, I don’t see a strong argument for why it would be okay to hurt or kill fish. </p>
<p> Add to that, the excessive cruelties of modern-day commercial fishing, where fish are often cut open alive or left to suffer for days in huge nets—and there’s a strong animal welfare case against eating fish. </p>
<p> 2. Environmental Concerns </p>
<p> Many forms of commercial fishing today result in a huge amount of bycatch—extra animals being caught that were not the intended target. </p>
<p> Bycatch greatly reduces the biodiversity in our oceans. It is estimated that 650,000 marine mammals (dolphins, whales, and porpoises) are injured or killed in nets intended for fish each year. </p>
<p> One of the more objectionable practices in modern commercial fishing is bottom trawling. Huge nets are dragged along the ocean floor, catching just about everything. </p>
<p> You can actually see the impact of bottom trawling from space. I couldn’t believe it when I saw this, but now it makes sense to me that bottom trawling is the ocean equivalent to clear-cutting forests. </p>
<p> 3. Health Concerns </p>
<p> It’s pretty well-known that fish can contain high levels of mercury, as well as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls). </p>
<p> The EPA declared that PCBs are likely to cause cancer in humans, and studies have linked them to birth defects in the children of women who consume lots of fish high in PCBs. </p>
<p> Since these toxins accumulate in animal fat, they become more and more concentrated as you move up the food chain. </p>
<p> Even when you consume animals raised on fish farms, they are often fed wild-caught fish that are contaminated with PCBs, so you can end up with fish that actually have higher concentrations of toxins than wild-caught fish. </p>
<p> Of course, many people consume fish for the healthy omega-3 fats. But to others, the threat of PCBs can be a strong counterpoint. Below, I’ll cover how to get omega-3 fats without the fish on a vegan diet. </p>
<p> Ostrovegans: Vegans Who Eat Oysters and Other Bivalves </p>
<p> Ostrovegans, sometimes called bivalvegans, are vegans who eat oysters and other bivalves (mussels, clams, and scallops). </p>
<p> The idea is that, unlike fish, bivalves like oysters are believed by many in the scientific community to actually not feel pain. </p>
<p> Bivalves lack a central nervous system, so although they have nerves, they don’t have brains or anything resembling it. Still, it is a controversial issue among vegans. PETA argues to still avoid eating bivalves. </p>
<p> I actually wrote a whole article on ostrovegans here, which goes into a lot more depth on whether bivalves feel pain and what it means for vegans. </p>
<p> Seagans: Vegans Who Eats Fish </p>
<p> I’m not sure how common this term is, but I have just recently heard the term “seagan” to refer to vegans who eat fish and seafood. </p>
<p> Seagans are different from pescatarians, then, because pescatarians still eat dairy products and eggs. Seagans eat a fully vegan diet besides the fish and seafood. </p>
<p> The rationale for a seagan diet is the supposed health benefits of eating fish for the omega-3 fatty acids. Here’s a seagan FAQ about it. But as I’ll cover in the next section, you can get your omega-3s from plant foods. </p>
<p> Getting Omega-3 Fats without Fish or Fish Oil </p>
<p> Many people talk about the need to eat fish for omega-3 fats, as if there are no other sources of omega-3 fats on the planet. You can still get your healthy omega-3s as a vegan. </p>
<p> Personally, I take a vegan DHA/EPA supplement every day, and I recommend the same to other vegans. DHA and EPA are two of the more bioavailable forms of omega-3s which non-vegans get from fish or fish oil. </p>
<p> You can also get omega-3 fats from food, but the forms of omega-3 found in vegan foods are not as bioavailable as the EPA and DHA. Your body has to convert it, and there is some concern over whether you can really convert it efficiently enough. </p>
<p> Still, you can load up with omega-3 rich vegan foods: flaxseeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and walnuts are some of the best sources. </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> Vegans do not eat fish or any other seafood. Ostrovegans and seagans provide two different exceptions to this rule if you count them as vegans (controversial!). </p>
<p> Luckily, there are plenty of yummy fish alternatives you can use in your cooking, and there are also ways for vegans to get healthy omega-3 fats even without consuming fish. </p>

<p> Do Vegans Eat Fish: The Low-Down On Alternative Diets </p>
<p> Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, flexitarian - many people are making the switch to these and other diet alternatives for many reasons ranging from health to ethics. What do they mean? Can vegans eat fish? We're here to clear up the confusion. </p>
<p> There are many confusing terms thrown around these days to describe almost every diet choice under the sun. For the diets mentioned above, let's break them down a little further. </p>
<p> There are several types of vegetarian diet, including lacto, ovo, and lacto-ovo vegetarians; some vegans choose to consume honey, and some choose not to eat white sugar and other products that are processed by animal products. The dietary options are seemingly endless, which can be confusing. </p>
<p> Can a vegetarian or vegan eat seafood? Is fish meat? Read below for more on what defines each alternative diet and what types of foods are considered part of a vegan diet. </p>
<p> Can you eat fish on a vegan diet? </p>
<p> Do vegans eat seafood? No, vegans don’t eat fish. Veganism is defined as a diet that is entirely free of any animal by-products. At its core, veganism was created in 1944 and is a lifestyle that is void of any animal products to limit animal exploitation. </p>
<p> Nowadays, people follow vegan diets but may not always subscribe to "veganism" and may enjoy the health benefits of eating a plant-based diet. </p>
<p> Vegans don't eat fish, being an animal product, but many make exceptions to build a diet that works for them. At that point, they don't follow traditional veganism but can still enjoy many of the benefits of a "vegan plus fish" diet of their own definition. </p>
<p> Is fish vegan? No. If you eat a plant-based diet but you also eat fish, your diet falls under the umbrella of "pescatarian." </p>
<p> Alternative Fish Products for Vegans </p>
<p> If you’re a vegan, have no fear. There are plenty of fish alternatives for you to enjoy: </p>
<p> #1. Algae and mushrooms </p>
<p> You can use these two ingredients to make a plant-based alternative to fish stock. Algae has a salty and savory flavor of the sea and makes for an excellent fish substitute. You can also use soya sauce and miso paste as a fish alternative. </p>
<p> Algae can also be used to make vegan caviar. </p>
<p> #2. Tofu-based alternatives </p>
<p> Tofu is a vegan’s best friend. It’s made from soaked and compacted soya beans that have been mixed with a coagulant. It has a very bland and neutral taste, that absorbs all the flavors of the food or sauce that it’s cooked with. Cook it with vegan fish broth, ground algae and crispy bread. It makes a delicious alternative to fish fingers. </p>
<p> #3. Seitan and jackfruit </p>
<p> Seitan is gluten-based and is neutral like tofu. It can be seasoned and marinated in delicious ways. It’s great for plant-based fish fillets and burgers. </p>
<p> Similarly, jackfruit absorbs the flavor of the food it’s cooked with, and makes fantastic fish alternatives. </p>
<p> #4. Marinated carrots </p>
<p> The way you prepare the carrots is key here. Cut them into thin strips and soak them for a few hours in a mixture of oil, vinegar, algae and liquid smoke. The carrot strips absorb all of this and taste like salmon! </p>
<p> #5. Tomatoes </p>
<p> Skin, pitted, filleted and marinated in the right spices and you can get tomatoes to taste just like tuna! </p>
<p> #6. Vegan sushi </p>
<p> You can use cucumber, avo and bell pepper to make vegan sushi. </p>
<p> Other Alternative Protein: Vegan Food Products </p>
<p> If you want to follow a diet that omits all animal by-products, some incredible meat alternatives are available to up your protein intake in any vegan meal. </p>
<p> Tofu is the #1 most popular plant-based protein enjoyed by those that eat vegan diets. It's incredibly versatile, high in protein, and contains essential minerals. You can stir-fry, bake, steam, or grill tofu - it's even delicious deep-fried, like in this tasty tofu tempura. </p>
<p> Other beans and legumes like lentils, black beans, and chickpeas are fantastic sources of protein and fiber that can be eaten fresh on salads or baked into meatless burgers. </p>
<p> Nuts and seeds like walnuts, peanuts, almonds, and sunflower seeds, are high in protein and brain-protecting fats; enjoy them raw, or blend soaked cashews to make a mean vegan cheese sauce. </p>
<p> Fermented, gut-healthy tempeh is an excellent substitute for bacon with its salty flavor and chewy texture, while wheat-based seitan has an uncanny resemblance to meat in both texture and flavor. </p>
<p> Do vegetarians eat fish? </p>
<p> Vegetarians abstain from eating the flesh of animals and fish but generally continue to enjoy products from animals, like dairy, eggs, honey, and more. </p>
<p> A vegetarian that eats fish also falls under the definition of "pescatarian." </p>
<p> Pescatarian vs. Vegetarian Diet </p>
<p> Pescetarians follow a mostly no meat diet but also choose to eat fish.So they will eat animal by-products like eggs, dairy, gelatine, and honey. They won’t eat red meat or chicken. If you’re interested in finding out more about the health benefits of vegetarianism and pescetarianism, read this article. </p>
<p> Pescatarian vs. Veganism </p>
<p> People who are vegan but eat fish are pescatarians. A vegan that eats fish might think of themselves as vegan, but any vegan diet with fish is best classified as pescatarian. </p>
<p> Why follow a pescatarian diet? </p>
<p> Vegetarian and vegan diets can feel quite restrictive, and sometimes finding food to eat outside of your own cooking can be challenging. Although vegan food availability seems to be improving, restaurants often don't have a ton of vegan options, if any at all. </p>
<p> Fish has some incredible health benefits, as they're incredibly rich in nutrients. Seafood is exceptionally high in protein and many essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B12, which is commonly far too low in many vegans. </p>
<p> Why? B12 is in many plant-based foods, but our bodies don't absorb B12 from plants as readily as animal by-products. </p>
<p> Fish also provides vegans and vegetarians with high doses of other essential nutrients. Omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA & DHA), for example, are almost non-existent in plant-based foods. These two fatty acids are crucial for optimal brain health, heart health, and proper fetal development. </p>
<p> Vegetarians can get omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and convert it in the body to EPA and DHA. Still, the process is complicated, leaving many vegetarians low in these two crucial fatty acids. </p>
<p> Ostrovegan diet </p>
<p> There are many people who follow a plant-based diet, who also eat oysters and mussels. This is because they feature many of the same characteristics as plants. What are these characteristics? </p>
<p> They are stationary; they can’t move around by themselves </p>
<p> They don’t have central nervous systems, and therefore can’t experience pain </p>
<p> They are not sentient beings; they have no senses </p>
<p> They can be farmed responsibly </p>
<p> Which diet should I choose? </p>
<p> Choosing to follow a specific diet is complicated; keep all of your most essential considerations in mind to find one that aligns with your values. </p>
<p> Here are a few things to consider when choosing a diet: </p>
<p> Health risks and potential improvements </p>
<p> Environmental implications </p>
<p> Following any of these diets is a choice, not a self-imposed restriction. Choose based on what you want to do for yourself and not from outside pressures. Don't worry about breaking the rules because you choose your own to live by and decide when it's okay for you to break them. </p>
<p> The term "flexitarian" defines the ever-growing complexity of dietary choices - it encompasses people that are mostly vegetarian or vegan but sometimes choose to consume animal products. </p>
<p> Final notes: Veganism with fish </p>
<p> Can a vegan eat fish? We've learned that no, a vegan who eats fish isn't a vegan, but a pescatarian. </p>
<p> A pescatarian diet can allow flexibility for those that mostly follow a vegan or vegetarian diet and who want to include fish and seafood. And even further along that spectrum, a flexitarian eats other animal by-products on occasion while mostly avoiding them in their diet. </p>
<p> There are many health benefits to pescetarianism, flexitarianism, as well as vegetarianism, and veganism. Weigh your values and determine what works best for you - there is no shame in doing what feels right for you, no matter the choice. It all comes down to personal preference. </p>

<p> Do Vegetarians Eat Fish or Seafood? </p>
<p> Vegetarian eating has become increasingly popular in recent years, and people may choose to eat this way because of ethical, environmental, religious, or health reasons. </p>
<p> A vegetarian diet emphasizes plant foods and includes some animal foods, so you may wonder if vegetarians eat fish or seafood. </p>
<p> This article provides an overview of whether you can eat fish on a vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> Vegetarians do not eat the flesh of animals. Thus, by this definition, fish and seafood are not vegetarian (1). </p>
<p> Some vegetarians, known as lacto-ovo-vegetarians, eat certain animal products, such as eggs, milk, and cheese. Still, they do not eat fish. </p>
<p> If vegetarians include fish and seafood in their diets but still avoid the flesh of other animals, they’re considered pescatarians. </p>
<p> However, whether pescatarians are labeled as such may be up to interpretation. Some people may still consider those who mostly eat a fully plant-based diet — with rare consumption of fish and seafood — vegetarians. </p>
<p> Those who follow other forms of predominantly plant-based eating patterns, such as the flexitarian or Mediterranean diet, may also eat fish and seafood (1). </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> Since fish and seafood are considered animal flesh, they’re not technically vegetarian. If someone eats these foods while otherwise following a vegetarian diet, they’re typically referred to as a pescatarian. </p>
<p> Eating fish or seafood can add more variety to a diet and allow more options for protein sources at meals. </p>
<p> Fish and seafood are rich in protein and provide numerous vitamins and minerals, including zinc and vitamin B12, which are vital for your immune and nervous systems. It can be difficult to get enough of these nutrients on a strict vegetarian diet (2, 3, 4). </p>
<p> For example, a single oyster provides 85% of the Daily Value (DV) for zinc and 78% of the DV for vitamin B12 (5). </p>
<p> Fish, especially salmon, herring, and sardines, is also the best dietary source of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). On the other hand, very few plant foods contain EPA and DHA (6). </p>
<p> These essential nutrients are important for proper fetal development and optimal brain and heart health throughout your life (7). </p>
<p> Certain plant foods provide the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which your body can convert into EPA and DHA, but it’s not easily converted. Thus, some vegetarian diets may lack omega-3 fatty acids (8). </p>
<p> The variety of vital nutrients that fish and seafood provide may be one of the main reasons that pescatarians choose to incorporate them into their otherwise plant-based eating patterns. </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> Pescatarians may choose to add fish to their vegetarian diets for more variety, as well as the protein, micronutrients, and omega-3 fatty acids that fish and seafood contain. </p>
<p> However, a pescatarian diet is a primarily plant-based diet that incorporates fish and seafood. </p>
<p> People may choose to follow a pescatarian eating pattern instead of a strictly vegetarian one for more variety, as well as the nutritional benefits of fish. </p>

<p> Do Vegetarians Get Sick If They Eat Meat? 9 Ways To Reintroduce Meat </p>
<p> As a vegetarian, we have all experienced that moment when we realize there is chicken broth in the soup we just ate or bits of meat in the casserole. We also may just wonder can I binge on one burger without any negative effects. Do vegetarians get sick if they eat meat? </p>
<p> Vegetarians may experience temporary digestive symptoms when reintroducing meat back into their diets. Your “gut flora” and meat disgesting enzymes need time to readjust to the digestion of meat again. Gradually reintroduce meat products starting with broth and then small pieces of fish or poultry moving on to heavier and fattier meats last. </p>
<p> What Happens When A Vegetarian Eats Meat? </p>
<p> A vegetarian can experiance eating meat in one of two ways. </p>
<p> They’ve accidentally consumed meat in a meal. </p>
<p> The person has intentionally reintroduced meat. </p>
<p> Regardless of the way the vegetarian has eaten meat they may experience phycological and physical effects after consuming meat. </p>
<p> In this article, I will share the most common symptoms of consuming meat after being a vegetarian and how to best reintroduce meat if you choose to do so. </p>
<p> The Psychological Reaction Of Eating Meat As A Vegetarian? </p>
<p> Many vegetarians have chosen to abstain from eating meat due to their compassion for animals. If a vegetarian has eaten meat accidentally or intentionally they may start to feel physicological effects. </p>
<p> A person may feel guilt or shame </p>
<p> One may feel regretful </p>
<p> Having these feelings may cause a person to feel physical effects. Depending on how upset the person becomes they may feel nausea, lightheadedness, uneasiness, stomach pain, and headache. </p>
<p> The Amount Of Meat You Eat Matters </p>
<p> The amount of meat you eat after being a vegetarian will affect how your body responds. </p>
<p> It’s better to reintroduce meat slowly. Your body will respond much better to consuming small amounts of meat compared to a large steak, hotdogs, and burgers. </p>
<p> If the meat consumption was accidental it’s likely that the amount was small and you should not experience any negative symptoms. </p>
<p> The Quality Of The Meat You Eat Matters </p>
<p> It makes a difference if you are eating a lean piece of chicken or fish compared to a bacon double cheeseburger. The quality of the meat being consumed matters. </p>
<p> If you are going to eat meat again after abstaining for some time it’s best to reintroduce small amounts of lean meats like fish, chicken, turkey, and pork. These meats are much easier to digest and are less likely to cause any negative side effects. </p>
<p> Your Digestive System Does Not Like Change </p>
<p> Everyone’s digestive system has built its own custom bacteria “gut flora”. This “gut flora” is based on the diet that one consumes and adjusts over time to suit that person’s diet. </p>
<p> If a person stops consuming meat products the enzymes needed to properly digest meat may decrease as they are not needed. </p>
<p> The reduction of meat digesting enzymes is not permanent. Your gut is amazing and will adjust to the needs of the foods being consumed. If your diet is drastically changed like eliminating meat or adding a lot of fiber-rich vegetables you may experience symptoms while your gut adjusts to its new needs. </p>
<p> Anytime you eat something different it can upset the balance of your “gut flora” and your gut will need time to adjust. </p>
<p> Drastic changes to your diet will affect your “gut flora” and can cause a temporary upset to your body. It’s best to make gradual dietary changes to lessen any symptoms you may experience. </p>
<p> You May Be Experiencing Food Poisioning </p>
<p> It’s possible that when someone has accidentally or intentionally eaten meat after being a vegetarian that they have gotten food poisoning. </p>
<p> The symptoms of food poisoning can be severe. The most common symptoms are. </p>
<p> Stomach Cramps </p>
<p> Food poisioning can last from several hours to days. </p>
<p> Some People Have Food Sensitivity To Meat </p>
<p> A meat sensitivity may cause digestive discomfort for some people like bloating, stomach issues, nausea, and headaches. If you’ve reintroduced meat for some time and you are still experiencing discomfort start keeping a log of your symptoms. </p>
<p> You can be tested for food sensitivities to know if you should be avoiding meat permanently. </p>
<p> Some Vegetarians May Have A Meat Allergy </p>
<p> Less than 1% of the population has a meat allergy. Those that have a meat allergy will have symptoms that are similar to other allergies like runny nose, eyes, congested air passages. These symptoms are much different and can be life-threatening compared to the typical discomfort of a diet change. </p>
<p> It’s unlikely that a person would develop this allergy while being a vegetarian. Most likely a person would’ve always had an allergy to meat. </p>
<p> What Symptoms Have Vegetarians Experienced When They’ve Eaten Meat? </p>
<p> Do vegetarians get sick if they eat meat? The side effects of eating meat after following a vegetarian diet will vary from person to person. Some people may not experience any symptoms while others may experience many. </p>
<p> The most common side effects are. </p>
<p> STOMACH PAIN </p>
<p> Some people have complained of stomach pains after reintroducing meat into their diets. </p>
<p> BLOATING </p>
<p> As your digestive system tries to adjust to the consumption of meat it is common to experience some abdominal bloating. </p>
<p> NAUSEA </p>
<p> The smell or consumption of meat has been known to cause nausea in vegetarians that have abstained from meat for a while. </p>
<p> SKIN PROBLEMS </p>
<p> Some vegetarians have experienced acne outbreaks after reintroducing meat to their diets. On the other hand, many people have experienced their acne problems disappearing and clearing up. </p>
<p> HORMONAL PROBLEMS </p>
<p> Women may experiance an increase in severity of menstrual symptoms. </p>
<p> TIREDNESS </p>
<p> Some people feel tired after eating meat. It may be due to the amount of energy needed to digest meat compared to plant products. </p>
<p> ACHINESS </p>
<p> People have complained of body aches after consuming meat. </p>
<p> GUILT </p>
<p> Most vegetarians are animal lovers and suffered from guilt after consuming meat. </p>
<p> How To Reintroduce Meat After Being A Vegetarian </p>
<p> You want to reintroduce meat back into your diet but, you’ve been a vegetarian for some time. These are my tips on how to best make this transition. </p>
<p> Re-introduce Meat Slowly </p>
<p> After being a vegetarian for some time the worst thing you can do is to binge eat meat. It’s best to gradually reintroduce meat products one at a time and in small portion sizes. Start with fish, poultry and then add red meat. </p>
<p> 2. Have Vegetables Remain The Staring Role </p>
<p> Your body has been used to consuming vegetables. Keep those vegetables in the staring role of your meals. Pasta with vegetables and small chunks of chicken. A baked sweet potato, roasted broccoli with a side of salmon. Your body will adjust better when your diet remains similar to what it has been. </p>
<p> 3. Support Your Gut Bacteria </p>
<p> Eat fermented foods and take a probiotic supplement for at least two weeks before reintroducing meat. </p>
<p> 4. Start With Bone Broth </p>
<p> If your digestive system has been sensitive to meat in the past start with bone broth before moving on to solid meat. </p>
<p> 5. Use Marinades With Acids </p>
<p> Marinate your meat in acids like vinegar and pineapple juice to help tenderize the meat before consumption. </p>
<p> 6. Consider Taking Digestive Enzymes </p>
<p> If you experience a heavy feeling after consuming a meal and have a difficult time digesting food talk to your doctor about reintroducing meat and taking digestive enzymes. </p>
<p> 7. Purchase High Quality Meats </p>
<p> Look for the highest quality meat you can purchase organic, grass-fed, and grass-finished meats. </p>
<p> 8. Consider The Source Of Your Meats </p>
<p> There is a good chance you became a vegetarian due to the unethical treatment of animals. Make sure if you transition back to consuming meat that it is sourced from places and ways that align with your personal ethics. </p>
<p> 9. Give Yourself Time </p>
<p> It doesn’t need to be a race. Slowly take your time with the reintroduction of meat and do what feels best for you. Most likely you transitioned slowly to a vegetarian diet. Take the same approach when exploring adding meat back into your diet. </p>
<p> CONCLUSION </p>
<p> Do vegetarians get sick if they eat meat? </p>
<p> After not consuming meat for some time a vegetarian may experience some digestive symptoms when reintroducing meat. </p>
<p> Gradually reintroduce meat products starting with broths then small pieces of fish and poultry. Avoid eating a steak or fattier meats like burgers, sausage, and hot dogs until you are well adjusted to consuming meat again. </p>
<p> Give your gut the time it needs to adjust. The enzymes in your gut are not used to digesting meats. Over time your gut will build up the required enzymes needed to fully digest meat. </p>
<p> You should not experience any severe discomfort. If you do you may be experiencing food poisoning, food sensitivity, or a food allergy. Talk with your doctor about any symptoms you experience. </p>
<p> Whatever your reasons were for becoming vegetarian or adding meat back into your diet, it’s best to listen to your body and fuel it with what it needs to thrive. </p>

<p> ​When (and what) To Eat After Dental Cleaning Procedures </p>
<p> A funny phenomenon we’ve seen in our dental office is as soon as a patient has had their bi-annual dental cleaning, they immediately ask us how long they need to wait to eat. </p>
<p> It is an understandable concern. No one wants to undo the dental cleaning work but many people come into the office without eating for hours prior to the appointment. </p>
<p> There are a few factors which may influence when you should eat after your appointment. Check and see which of these apply to your particular case. </p>
<p> Carefully Eat Right After Dental Cleaning </p>
<p> You don’t have to wait for hours to eat after your dental cleaning. In fact, you don’t have to wait at all! That’s right, you can eat right after a dental cleaning. You just might not want to eat anything. </p>
<p> Dental cleaning can cause your teeth and gums to be sensitive. Very cold or very hot foods may be too intense for freshly cleaned teeth. </p>
<p> Fluoride Treatment Means You Should Wait </p>
<p> Okay, in most cases you can eat right after a dental cleaning. Except if you receive a fluoride treatment with your dental cleaning. </p>
<p> A fluoride treatment can help strengthen your teeth against decay, repairing the enamel on your teeth. To receive the most out of this treatment, you will need to wait 30 minutes after your dental cleaning to eat or drink. By waiting 30 minutes, the fluoride treatment has enough time to seal around your teeth. </p>
<p> What To Eat After A Dental Cleaning </p>
<p> While you can eat whatever you want after a dental cleaning, there may be some things you want to avoid. Some foods to avoid for a while after a cleaning are foods which are: </p>
<p> Citruses </p>
<p> Spicy </p>

<p> It’s no secret that many of us like to gorge on fish and chips on Fridays, but are you aware that fish is traditionally what you’re ‘meant’ to eat on Good Friday? </p>
<p> Eating fish on the Friday before Easter Sunday is a ritual lots of people, religious or not, choose to follow every year. </p>
<p> It’s a tradition that is as essential to Easter, as lovely chocolate eggs, except it goes back much further - and most folks don’t even know why. </p>
<p> The custom started with the Catholics, who gave eating warm-blooded animals the swerve on Fridays, to acknowledge and do penance for the death of Jesus. </p>
<p> Good Friday marks the day Jesus Christ was crucified and, according to Christianity, Jesus sacrificed his flesh on Good Friday, when he was executed and died for our sins. </p>

<p> It's one of the many ways that you can read the news that matters to you from EssexLive. </p>
<p> This is why the Church advises Christians to ‘abstain from meaty flesh’ on the anniversary of the Messiah’s death, as a reminder. </p>
<p> And it’s not only Good Friday you do this (if you’re a conservative follower), as Catholic law claims that Catholics aged 14 and older should avoid eating meat on every Friday during Lent. </p>
<p> In ancient times, meat was seen as a delicacy and therefore a worthy sacrifice and only slaughtered when there was something to celebrate. </p>
<p> It was seen as something eaten during feasts whereas fish was an ‘everyday thing’, especially as most people were fishermen. </p>
<p> But our eating habits have changed considerably over the years with many fish widely viewed as the classier of the two. </p>
<p> Why is the Friday before Easter called Good Friday? </p>
<p> It's down to the actual meaning of the word ‘good’, according to the Oxford Dictionary. </p>
<p> The word ‘good’ traditionally “designates a day on (or sometimes a season in) which religious observance is held”. </p>
<p> Some people also say that ‘good’ means holy and others suggest it’s actually a corruption of ‘God’s Friday.’ </p>
<p> Is anything else prohibited on Good Friday? </p>
<p> Gambling was banned in Britain on Good Friday until just over a decade ago. </p>
<p> Betting shops have only been given permission to open up on the holiday since 2008, and racing was forbidden on the day until 2014. </p>

<p> Getting a tooth extraction means you’ll have a tender wound in your mouth for at least a week. It may seem daunting to think of foods that won’t hurt to eat or irritate the wound, but it’s easier than you might think. The idea is to get the nutrients you need with as little chewing as possible. Knowing what kinds of foods to avoid is also key to ensure your gums heal quickly and without complications. </p>
<p> Wait at least 1 hour after your surgery to remove the gauze and eat. It’s normal for the area to bleed for the first 24 hours after your surgery. Your dentist will have placed gauze on top of the extraction site after your surgery and may have given you some to take home. If the site starts to bleed again while you’re eating (or at any time), gently bite down on a fresh piece of gauze or a damp tea bag until the bleeding stops.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> If you plan to take pain medication, you’ll need to eat something to help coat your stomach and prevent nausea. </p>
<p> You may not feel like eating anything after your surgery, and that’s okay because the wound will need at least an hour to form a blood clot so it can stop bleeding. </p>
<p> If your dentist didn’t give you gauze to take home and you don’t have any tea, you can buy dental gauze from most drugstores. </p>
<p> Take in liquids or mushy items only for the first 2 days of your recovery.[2] X Expert Source Alina Lane, DDS Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. From the swelling to the jaw pain, eating might be a little rough the first couple of days. You’ll need to stick to a liquid or near-liquid diet to get as many nutrients as you can with the least amount of chewing (and pain).[3] X Research source </p>
<p> A few days before your surgery, stock up on fruits and veggies for smoothies or buy as many pre-made shakes you need to get through the first 48 hours. </p>
<p> Incorporate small, soft solid foods 3 to 4 days after your surgery. For the first 1 to 3 days, you’ll need to follow a liquid or mushy diet. Once the swelling has gone down and you can talk or move your jaw without so much pain, you can try to eat small bits of solid foods like fish or well-cooked vegetables.[4] X Research source </p>
<p> Just be sure to chop or process solids like meats and veggies into small bits the first day you transition away from liquid or mushy foods. </p>
<p> Take small bites to avoid overwhelming your jaw. Your mouth and jaw will likely be swollen and sore for a few days after your surgery. Smaller bites will be less taxing than trying to deal with large quantities of food in your mouth.[5] X Research source </p>
<p> Let the food rest on your tongue for a bit so your saliva can soften it up. </p>
<p> Don't chew food on the same side of your mouth as the extraction. Use the other side of your mouth to gently chew your food until you’re fully recovered.[6] X Expert Source Alina Lane, DDS Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. This will minimize the chance that any food bits will irritate your gums or get stuck in the site of the extraction.[7] X Research source </p>
<p> If you accidentally get food lodged in the extraction site, gently swish it out with warm saltwater.[8] X Expert Source Alina Lane, DDS Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. Don’t pick at it or try to get it out with your finger, a toothbrush, or a toothpick. </p>
<p> If the food doesn’t come out after swishing and exacerbates any pain or swelling, call your dentist or oral surgeon right away. </p>
<p> Avoid sucking anything through a straw. Straws create pressure in your mouth, which can dislodge the blood clot. Not only will this reopen the wound and cause bleeding, but it will slow down the healing process.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> Using wide-mouthed straws or 2 straws isn’t a better option so try to avoid straws altogether. </p>
<p> Drink healthy smoothies or meal-replacement drinks. Add lots of water or milk so the smoothie is thin and easy to drink. You won't be able to use a straw, so make sure it's loose enough to drink normally out of a cup. If you don’t want to make your own smoothie or don’t have access to a blender, buy pre-made meal replacement shakes instead.[10] X Research source </p>
<p> Try adding cocoa powder, banana, or frozen berries to sweeten up your smoothie. </p>
<p> Don't add any small seeds like flax or chia because they could scrape your gums or get lodged in the site of the extraction. </p>
<p> Avoid making smoothies with fruits like blackberries and strawberries because the seeds may not fully break down in the blender. </p>
<p> Sip on smooth, brothy soups free of chunks or chewy bits. For pre-made soups, use a strainer to take out any noodles, vegetables, or protein chunks. You can also whip up your own brothy soup from scratch by putting well-cooked vegetables into a blender with water, cream, or broth.[11] X Research source </p>
<p> If you like, grind up the vegetables, noodles, and chicken and put them back into the soup for a serving of protein. </p>
<p> Make sure the soup or broth isn't too hot because excessive heat can irritate the wound. </p>
<p> Get whole grains and fiber with warm, runny oatmeal. Use regular oats or instant oats and avoid steel-cut varieties because they're too tough and the small bits may get lodged in the wound. Make sure the oats aren’t steaming hot when you eat them because exposing the wound to heat may increase blood flow to the area and cause the wound to start bleeding again.[12] X Research source </p>
<p> Oats contain a type of fiber that boosts your immune system, speeding up your recovery process. </p>
<p> Try making overnight oats by combining equal amounts of old-fashioned (rolled) oats and your choice of milk in a bowl or jar. Stir or shake the mixture before sealing and refrigerating it for at least 6 hours. </p>
<p> Start the day with soft scrambled eggs 1 to 3 days after surgery. Set your stove to medium heat and stir the whisked eggs as they're cooking. Once they've barely firmed, remove them from the stove, let them cool a bit, and dig in. [13] X Research source </p>
<p> You can also make soft poached, boiled, or sunny-side-up eggs. </p>
<p> Add thin slices of avocado on top for a healthy serving of omega 3 fatty acids. </p>
<p> Get your protein from soft white fish, refried beans, and pureed legumes. Beans are an excellent source of protein and fiber that will fill you up with less chewing. Buy pre-made refried beans or cook your own and mash them up in a food processor. If you eat fish, soft white varieties like sole, cod, and trout are good options.[14] X Research source </p>
<p> Feel free to add spices and herbs like paprika, cilantro, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, and thyme for a burst of flavor. </p>
<p> Snack on soft cheeses or add them to meals. Cottage cheese, cream cheese, and soft cheeses like brie and feta are ways to get probiotics, protein, and healthy fats while the wound is healing. Avoid eating large or thick slices of hard cheeses like smoked gouda, parmesan, cheddar, and manchego because you'll have to do extra chewing. [15] X Research source </p>
<p> If you want to have harder cheeses, use a fine grater to shred them first and don't eat the tough skins. </p>
<p> Mash skinned potatoes any way you like. Skin, chop, and boil whatever variety of potato you like—sweet potato, russet, red, white, or new potatoes are all nutritious options. Just be sure to peel the potatoes first because the fibrous skins can get stuck in the gap where your tooth used to be.[16] X Research source </p>
<p> You can add solid proteins and vegetables to your potatoes after day 3—just be sure to cook and dice them well so you don't have to chew as much. </p>
<p> Add water or milk to the potatoes before you mash them to make them thinner. </p>
<p> Treat yourself with pudding, jello, frozen yogurt, or ice cream. Lucky for you, these soft, sweet treats can glide down your throat with little to no chewing! Stock your fridge or freezer with any variety of pudding, jello, frozen yogurt or ice cream—just make sure to choose varieties that are free of hard chunks and toppings.[17] X Research source </p>
<p> For instance, avoid getting a flavor of ice cream that has waffle cone pieces or chewy cookie bits in it. </p>
<p> You should also avoid yogurt that has blackberries or strawberries blended at the bottom. The seeds can get stuck in the wound. </p>
<p> Cut out all varieties of bread for at least 4 days. Bread requires lots of chewing, so you'll have to wait until your gums are strong enough and the excavation site has mostly healed. Crunchy toast can also scratch your sensitive gums so it’s best to skip bread altogether until at least 5 days to 1 week after your surgery.[18] X Research source </p>
<p> This includes all types of tortillas, flatbreads, and pizzas. </p>
<p> You may be able to enjoy extremely soft varieties of bread like sweet Hawaiian rolls after 1 week. </p>
<p> Don’t eat rice or foods with small, granular pieces.[19] X Expert Source Alina Lane, DDS Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. All varieties of rice are off-limits because the small, granular grains can get stuck in the extraction site. Bulgar, quinoa, farro, barley, and couscous will also have to wait for at least 7 days or until you’re able to eat normally again.[20] X Research source </p>
<p> This includes soups with rice or grains in them. If you only have pre-made soup with these grains, use a fine mesh strainer to remove them. </p>
<p> Forego hard, crunchy snack foods.[21] X Expert Source Alina Lane, DDS Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. Crackers, popcorn, pretzels, chips, seeds, and nuts are too sharp and crunchy to eat with exposed, tender gum tissue in your mouth. Snack on soft foods like yogurt, applesauce, and soft cheese for the first week or until the wound has completely healed.[22] X Research source </p>
<p> Hard, crunchy foods should be the last thing you reintroduce into your diet once you're healed up. </p>
<p> Stay away from spicy foods and condiments for 1 week. Hot sauce, spicy peppers, and spices like cayenne can irritate the wound and prolong the healing process. Instead, use salt, pepper, and mild, non-fibrous herbs to flavor your food.[23] X Research source </p>
<p> For example, pieces of dried rosemary leaves can scratch or get stuck in the extraction site, so choose ground rosemary powder instead. </p>
<p> Avoid chewy and al dente varieties of pasta. Unfortunately, most varieties of pasta are going to be extremely difficult to chew. They may even stick to the site of the excavated tooth. Penne, spaghetti, orzo, and bowties and other varieties are off-limits for at least 5 days or until the wound has healed.[24] X Research source </p>
<p> If you can't go without pasta, macaroni and cheese is a soft, easy-to-eat option. Be sure to use lots of milk or water so it’s soft and creamy. </p>
<p> Cooked polenta is also a great way to satisfy a craving for pasta while your gums are recovering. </p>

<p> Power of Positivity September 19, 2020 16:03Last modified September 19, 2020 20:56 </p>
<p> To eat or not to eat, that is the question on many fitness enthusiasts’ minds. Are you still baffled as to whether you should eat before or after working out? Many experts say that there’s no easy answer because it depends on the person. </p>
<p> Do you exercise as soon as you get up, or do you wait until the evening? That’s a factor to consider for your food choices during the day. How your body will respond is based on whether you eat before or after your workout. </p>
<p> Some people prefer to wait until after exercising to refuel their bodies, called a fasted workout. If you have a bite to eat before you hit the gym, it’s known as a fed workout. Before you make your decision, here are some points to consider about each option. </p>
<p> Eating Afterwards: Fasted Workout Pros </p>
<p> Here are the benefits of a “fasted workout.” </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> Fasted Workouts Allow Your Body to Burn Fat for Fuel </p>
<p> Think of your body as an automobile. Instead of gasoline, your body is fueled by carbohydrates and body fat. When you eat, your body breaks the food down and converts the fat to triglycerides and the carbohydrates like sugar and glycogen. The triglycerides are stored in your fatty deposits, and the glycogen is stored in your muscles and liver. </p>
<p> If you eat a meal before you work out, your body will use the carbs from that food for immediate fuel. Your blood glucose and levels will also be higher after you eat. Fasting workouts make your body use its fat reserves for energy, meaning you will burn more fat. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> Fasted Workouts May Help You Avoid Indigestion </p>
<p> Maybe you’re one of those people who feel queasy while trying to exercise after eating. If you do a fasted exercise session, you may not get the usual nausea and indigestion. Meals heavy in carbs can also give you that groggy feeling similar to where you stuff yourself at the Thanksgiving table. </p>
<p> Fasted Workouts May Stop Exercise Procrastination </p>
<p> How many times have you been determined to get up a half-hour earlier in the morning for your exercise routine? Maybe you’ve been intent on doing a workout right after work, instead. Deciding when to eat and when to exercise can make a big difference in following your goal. </p>
<p> Before you plan your time slot for exercising, think about your usual mornings at home and your days at work. You wrestle the kiddos out of bed, make sure they are ready for school, feed them breakfast, and rush them out the door to catch the bus. Then, you grab a health shake and hope you make it to work on time. </p>
<p> While running back and forth at the office, you may be tempted to grab something not-so-healthy from the vending machine. Maybe you eat lunch while trying to finish emails or make important phone calls. No wonder you procrastinate working out after work. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> Instead, you might consider a fasted workout in the morning, even if you need to set your alarm clock to get you up earlier than usual. Did you know that exercise can make your body produce hormones that boost your moods and performance? Not only can you burn some extra body fat, but you’ll have a jump start on your day. </p>
<p> Cons of Fasted Workouts </p>
<p> Here are a few reasons a fasted workout might not work for you. </p>
<p> Less Energy During a Session </p>
<p> Knowing when to eat is a vital tool for working out. You may do your best when you eat before exercising. It may boost your energy and help you have a more productive session. </p>
<p> However, exercise regimens must be tailored to the individual. Are you one of the many people who notice a less intense workout if you don’t eat beforehand? Many individuals experience this energy droop. </p>
<p> For an optimal training session, your body needs glucose for its fuel mix. If you don’t have some available in your bloodstream at the time, your body must tap into your reserves that are stored as glycogen in your muscles. </p>
<p> What if you don’t have enough glycogen in your reserves? Then, your body will turn to its fat reserves for energy. Unfortunately, fat isn’t oxidized as quickly as carbs (glycogen) in your body, so your exercising performance may be lackluster. </p>
<p> Your workout intensity will also help you decide when to eat. The average person doing a 30-minute session a day may not have an issue with fasted workouts. However, you may not reach peak performance for high-intensity training without a pre-workout meal. </p>
<p> Low Blood Sugar </p>
<p> If you are following an exercise routine, you are also probably maintaining a healthy diet. Are you trying one of the many diets that encourage a low-carb and high-protein intake? You’ll have less glycogen stored in your muscles, so your body won’t have the extra fuel it needs for a workout. </p>
<p> In this case, fasted workouts can cause a sudden drop in your blood glucose levels, and you may feel groggy and nauseous. You may even be tempted to binge-eat. If this is your experience, a fasted workout may not be the best option for you. </p>
<p> Eating Before: Fed Workout Pros </p>
<p> Here are some great reasons to opt for a fed workout. </p>
<p> You’ll See Fewer Drops in Blood Sugar </p>
<p> Do your blood glucose levels drop significantly before eating? A fed workout may minimize this condition. Knowing when to eat when you have an insulin sensitivity is essential for your health and your workout success. </p>
<p> You Will Have More Energy for Workouts </p>
<p> It stands to reason that if you want energy and strength for an optimal workout, you need fuel. Having a small meal before your exercise session will provide your body with protein and carbs to burn. You’ll notice that you can exercise harder and longer. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> Deciding when to eat for the best workout can make a difference in how many calories you burn. A pre-workout meal may help you sustain longer sessions and lift heavier weights. These benefits can result in burning more fat and sculpting a leaner body. </p>
<p> Preserves Your Muscles </p>
<p> Muscle preservation is an essential component of strengthening and toning your body. Did you know that some people lose more nitrogen during a fasted workout than a fed one? Nitrogen is critical for processing protein that builds and maintains healthy muscles. </p>
<p> Helps Burn More Calories After Your Workout </p>
<p> Did you know that your body continues to burn calories after you finish an exercise session? You are breathing harder and inhaling more oxygen, which burns more calories for a bit. This process is called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), which isn’t inhibited after a fed workout. </p>
<p> Fed Workout Cons </p>
<p> Here are some reasons that you might to skip the “fed workout.” </p>

<p> Email * </p>
<p> Submit </p>
<p> Need to Give More Thought to Your Snack </p>
<p> If you opt for a fed workout, pay close attention to what you consume. Skip milk, high-fiber, or high-fat foods, as you could get a stomachache if you work out after eating these. The Mayo Clinic suggests a smoothie, a piece of fruit, an organic energy bar, or a half of a peanut butter sandwich as great options. </p>
<p> You Might Feel Sluggish </p>
<p> Many fitness enthusiasts report feeling sluggish after eating, losing the motivation to work out after a meal. </p>
<p> Additional Tips on When to Eat in Relation to Your Exercise Sessions </p>
<p> Knowing what to eat for an optimal workout is just as important as knowing when to eat. Not all foods are created equal. If you decide that a fed workout is best for you, consider these points: </p>
<p> • Stay Hydrated </p>
<p> You lose a lot of water during a heavy exercise routine, so you should consider drinking some before you start. Keep plenty of water handy for during and after the workout. Some trainers also recommend sports drinks to replace essential electrolytes. </p>
<p> • Eat Some Carbs </p>
<p> Your body must have a certain amount of carbohydrates for energy and survival. Complex carbs are best for your pre-workout snack or light meal. Try steel-cut oatmeal, a slice of whole-wheat toast, a piece of fruit, or a low-sugar/low-fat energy bar. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> • Try a Protein Shake </p>
<p> For a healthy boost of protein, you can’t beat a tasty protein shake or a fruit and protein smoothie. Protein shakes are quick and easy to make. You may also enjoy a small handful of nuts, low-fat Greek yogurt, a boiled egg, or a lean slice of turkey. </p>
<p> What Should You Eat After a Workout </p>
<p> Do you do well with a fasted workout? It would help if you had some nourishment as soon as your session is complete. Rehydrate your body and replenish your electrolytes with water or a sports drink. Then, have a light meal or snack that’s high in complex carbs and protein. </p>
<p> If you choose, you can enjoy another health shake afterward. For the best post-workout food combination, try things like fish, brown rice, quinoa, beans, or a little tofu. </p>
<p> Final Thoughts on When to Eat–Before or After a Workout? </p>
<p> Have you ever finished an intense workout and felt like you could eat everything in the refrigerator? The feeling is incredibly potent if you’ve completed a fasted exercise session. Be careful not to give in to cravings. </p>
<p> If it helps, pre-portion your workout meals and snacks. You’ll have them on-hand before or after and won’t be grabbing the first thing that comes to mind. Fruit, health shakes, and low-fat protein bars are quick snacks when you are on the go from the gym. </p>
<p> Enjoy a balanced meal with protein, complex carbs, and essential fats. Eat the correct portions and keep your calories under control. Overeating and indulging in empty calories will only defeat your workout efforts. </p>
<p> Deciding when to eat for an optimal workout is a personal choice. Both fasted workouts and fed activities have their benefits and shortcomings. Before you make a choice or start any new exercise regimen, discuss it with your primary healthcare provider, a certified trainer, or a registered dietician. </p>

<p> Getting into shape can seem like an uphill battle. Everything seems to tie into each other, and complex juicing recommendations can only make things worse. It can be hard to determine what can be eaten during a juice cleanse. </p>
<p> Can you eat anything during a juice cleanse? Consuming solid food is not only permitted but also encouraged to help your body get rid of toxins. During and after your cleanse, it is important to only eat vegetables, either raw or steamed. Fruits and nuts are also acceptable to snack on during a cleanse. </p>
<p> Juicing doesn’t have to be as complicated as it seems. Below, we’ll go over what foods are the best to eat during a cleanse, as well as foods to avoid and cover the topic of juice cleansing more in-depth. </p>
<p> Foods You Can Eat and When? </p>
<p> The foods you will be allowed to eat are determined by how far into your cleanse you are. Expect to stick to fruit and vegetables for the first few days to get your body used to its new diet. </p>
<p> For the first time cleansers, you may need a higher caloric intake than dieters who have cleansed longer than you have. </p>
<p> With juicing comes three separate phases that have different food options to keep your diet on track. Each phase has a varying timeline of how long it should last. The three phases are known as </p>
<p> Pre-Cleanse (2-7 days depending on your lifestyle and diet) </p>
<p> During (3-10 days) </p>
<p> Post-Cleanse(Min. 5 days & up to 2 weeks) </p>
<p> Your body is going to need time to adapt to its new diet, so if you’re used to eating pizza, you may need to get your body used to juicing before committing to it completely for 3-10 days. </p>
<p> #1. Pre-Cleanse: It’s fine to add some proteins </p>
<p> Start off with a lighter but still healthy diet at least three days before you start your cleanse. This will help make sure that your body is able to fight off future cravings better, and you’ll be more likely to stick to the plan. </p>
<p> These are other acceptable things to eat other than fruits and vegetables or high-calorie foods during your first few days before the cleanse. The list below even features healthy proteins: </p>
<p> Whole Grains: Foods such as Rice and Quinoa are perfectly acceptable, but veer away from starch. </p>
<p> Eggs: Stick with organic eggs to play it safe and try to keep away from frying them because of the oils </p>
<p> Your main intake is going to be from blended up vegetables and fruits, so packing in some healthy protein can ensure that you stay full longer, and gives you a broader palette of options to choose from in the beginning. </p>
<p> By that we mean you have more foods to choose from and aren’t stuck with picking the same options repeatedly. </p>
<p> #2. During the Cleanse: Eat as little solid food as possible, but it’s fine to include some </p>
<p> During this time, your body is going to be going through the process of detoxifying. Which means the harmful toxins in your body are being flushed out. </p>
<p> Hunger pangs are common at this phase for those that are not experienced, and it is advised to eat small healthy snacks in between juicing. This phase can last anywhere from 3-7 days. </p>
<p> Many nutritionists stress having 100% of your daily nutritional intake comes directly from juicing. Why? Because eating solid foods run the risk of slowing down the juicing progress altogether. </p>
<p> That doesn’t mean that solid foods are prohibited at this pointed. If you do choose other alternatives, then follow the list below to help give you an idea of what would be best to eat without hurting the cleansing process. </p>
<p> Extra Virgin Olive Oil ( it contains heart-healthy fat and polyphenols, which act as antioxidants. Add 1-2 tbsp of olive oil to your salad is perfectly fine.) </p>
<p> Soaked Nuts and Seeds (These are great for getting nutrients such as the B vitamins. Chia seeds have great nutritional value at 4.6 grams ) </p>
<p> The two foods above make sure you don’t branch out too far from your diet plan. </p>
<p> #3. Post-Cleanse: time to slowly re-introduce solid foods </p>
<p> This phase can take up to two weeks, and its recommended to slowly escalate to more solid foods over time. This is a very key stage! Your stomach is very detoxed at this point. So, to correctly re-introduce solid food, it will prevent you from having post-cleanse diarrhea. </p>
<p> Here is the point where you will be able to slowly start reintroducing the foods you were practically banned from eating. </p>
<p> You may feel excited to start eating meals that you originally had before the plan, but that is not recommended. </p>
<p> Follow a diet that was similar to the juice cleanse at first. This will make sure that your body has completely gone through with the cleansing process before you put in any more potentially harming food back into your system. </p>
<p> Your first day after finishing the juice cleanse should still see foods that you ate during it as your main nutritional source. On the second day, these options begin to become more viable: </p>
<p> Brown Rice (You can also eat other rice such as couscous) </p>
<p> Eggs </p>
<p> Vegan Yogurt (foods like coconut or almond yogurt can be added) </p>
<p> Notice how protein and dairy are coming back in its healthiest forms? The list grows to cover protein sources like chicken and fish only five to six days after you finished your cleanse. </p>
<p> Don’t be afraid to add in a small amount of starch like the Brown Rice above, but make sure to limit the number of carbs you gain from them. </p>
<p> You can eat carbs to keep you full for a longer amount of time, but make sure not every food you eat is packed with them. </p>
<p> Remember that throughout this entire process, it is very important to stick with purely organic food. </p>
<p> With all these being said, below is a summary of things you are suggested to eat during a juice cleanse. </p>
<p> Please note that it’s better to choose less than 5 munchable food and stick to them during your juice cleanse day. </p>
<p> Studies show that limited food options can help you reducing craving needs, also it leaves your body enough energy for the cleansing process. </p>
<p> SUMMARY </p>
<p> STAGES </p>
<p> TYPES OF FOOD </p>
<p> EXAMPLES </p>
<p> Min. 60% fruit & vegetables Max. 40% healthy solid food </p>
<p> Brown rice Eggs, Vegan Yogurts </p>
<p> Foods to Avoid During A Juice Cleanse </p>
<p> If you are interested in juicing, then you will have to follow a rigorous diet. </p>
<p> There are some food out there that would be great for juicing if they didn’t have low water content. Foods like Bananas and Avocados are terrible for juicing but make for decent smoothies or just eat directly. </p>
<p> Besides, you are better off not only using foods that have very high water-content during juicing as it will be hard to properly blend them up. But it needs up to you to do the mix regarding the taste and texture. </p>
<p> Apricots and peaches </p>
<p> Overripe tropical fruits (Pineapple, Kiwis.etc) </p>
<p> However, below are the things that you should avoid these at all cost: </p>
<p> Alcohol: Drinks like a beer can be very high in calories and carbs </p>
<p> Caffeine: Slows or stops the process of the diet </p>
<p> Processed Foods: Often high in carbs and saturated fat </p>
<p> Meat: Has great protein, but the saturated fat can pose a problem for your body </p>
<p> Dairy: During a cleanse, dairy products can prevent unwanted weight gain and promote diseases. </p>
<p> The food mentioned in the list above can certainly bring their fair share of benefits, but consuming any of these during your cleanse can seriously set the progress back. </p>
<p> Many people flock to these foods because they are unable to properly control their cravings during the cleanse. </p>
<p> How to Deal With Cravings That Come With Cleansing </p>
<p> Hunger pangs and cravings are common for those just starting off the diet. It is also why so many people stop because they aren’t very well prepared. </p>
<p> This can mean the person didn’t pre-diet properly or didn’t know the options available to fight off these problems. </p>
<p> If these problems are becoming persistent throughout your diet, then you will be relieved to know that there are outside remedies that can tide you over. These are the best foods to keep cravings and stomach aches at bay </p>
<p> Vegetable Broth: Even Bone-broth is fine for you to eat. Salt should be added in moderation, and spices like fresh turmeric can add flavor </p>
<p> Carrots </p>
<p> Salads: Avoid Caesar salads as sometimes the chicken is processed. Chia seeds are great to add in along with olive oil and vinegar. Keep your condiments completely natural </p>
<p> Celery </p>
<p> Carrots and Celery aren’t the only vegetables you can eat. Any other vegetables are fine, but seeing how some are high in water-content, it may be best to not juice them. </p>

<p> It is also important to remember that scheduling your juicing sessions closer together can help you with this as well. </p>
<p> Don’t push them too far apart, or else you may see yourself growing more and more tempted to quit the cleanse altogether. Don’t drink too much whenever you juice, but make sure they are scheduled closely together </p>
<p> What Does A Juice Cleanse do to Your Body? </p>
<p> The main goal of a juice cleanse to detoxify the body and help it lose weight. It can provide the body with extra vitamins and nutrients since all of your body’s energy is going to come mainly from fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p> Juices also contain a fair amount of anti-inflammatory compounds that can help with your immune system. Broccoli is an ingredient that is advised to put in for its Vitamin K that helps with the compounds. </p>
<p> The anti-inflammatory compounds work hand in hand by supporting enzymes that help with a healthier digestive system. </p>
<p> Your body may see serious withdrawals since it will no longer be gaining energy from meat and poultry. </p>
<p> This is why we added the list above to help you fight off future cravings. Symptoms of withdrawal include </p>
<p> Low Blood Sugar </p>
<p> Dehydration </p>
<p> Dizziness </p>
<p> Constipation </p>
<p> Negative Side-Effects from Juicing </p>
<p> Juicing has its advantages, but it isn’t for everyone. There are a few risks that come with juicing. Drinking large amounts of the juice too often can result in diarrhea, kidney damage, as well as getting your body used to a drastically lower calorie intake than what it was used to. </p>
<p> The symptoms of this can encompass things such as shortness of breath and nausea, and many sufferers report bouts of fatigue </p>
<p> The nutrients you take in have a risk of not staying in your system since the juice also acts as a laxative, another issue that would not pair well with kidney damage. This means you may not retain everything you put in your body throughout the day. </p>
<p> Add in the fact that lower blood sugars are a common risk, and you’ll see that cheating on your diet doesn’t sound as dangerous as before. </p>
<p> By that we mean it’s not as harmful to have prohibited foods to keep your body’s nutrients balanced. </p>
<p> These factors are some of the reasons why you need to be hesitant about starting a juice cleanse. Yes, the diet does have its benefits, but you still need to steer clear of juicing companies that claim their products can cure diseases or act as a permanent solution to weight loss. Many of those claims don’t have the proper medical backing. </p>
<p> Can You Drink Coffee While Juicing? </p>
<p> Coffee can be very appealing for those that have had to ditch it and focus on their diet. Some dieters may also believe that a single cup couldn’t hurt. </p>
<p> Although you can, you run the risk of hindering the process of getting the toxins out of your body. </p>
<p> If you are having problems with caffeine withdrawals than organic coffee with no creamer or sugars can work for you. However, it is considered better for you to wean yourself off of caffeine a few days before your fast begins. </p>
<p> Coffee isn’t completely off the table for the diet; you just need to make sure that everything you put into your body throughout the cleanse is organic. </p>
<p> Water is your best friend for helping the juice gets rid of the toxins, so try and drink the recommended eight glasses of water every day along with your juice. </p>
<p> Caffeine isn’t just found in coffee, and it’s advised that you also stay away from other possible temptations such as </p>
<p> Green Tea </p>
<p> Black Tea </p>
<p> Chocolate </p>
<p> Because de-cafe doesn’t have any caffeine in it, you will still be able to enjoy it as you would outside of the juice cleanse. </p>
<p> The Verdict </p>
<p> Eating foods isn’t prohibited during a juice cleanse, and it is oftentimes recommended for those that aren’t used to juicing themselves. </p>
<p> Each phase is different in both time and what foods you are allowed to eat to not disturb the process your body is undergoing. </p>
<p> No matter what phase you are going through, there is always an option for you when you get hungry. </p>

<p> On Good Friday many households in Kent will be eating fish. </p>
<p> The Easter tradition is popular across the country and comes from Christianity. </p>
<p> For the more devout Christians, many abstain from meat every Friday of the year to follow a rule laid out by the Vatican which still stands today. </p>
<p> Others only implement the tradition on Good Friday as part of the Easter weekend's festivities. </p>

<p> This year's Easter is an early one and the holiday weekend is upon us, happening this week. </p>
<p> UK Bank Holidays are on the calendar for this Friday, April 2 and Monday, April 5. </p>
<p> The Friday is known as Good Friday and holds particular religious importance. </p>
<p> In The Bible, Jesus was executed on Good Friday and died for the sins of humanity. </p>
<p> Religious teachings say he sacrificed his flesh and on the anniversary of Christ's death, people should avoid eating the flesh of animals to commemorate the day. </p>
<p> The meat ban was first imposed by the Pope every Friday but was relaxed in the 1960s by Pope Paul VI. </p>
<p> Some Christian followers impose the meat ban for every day of the 40 days of Lent which lead up to Easter. </p>
<p> As an alternative, many opt for fish, which is permitted for consumption on Good Friday as it is seen as an alternative form of flesh. </p>
<p> The presence of fish in The Bible is strong with many of Jesus' followers being fishermen and Christ famously fed the 5000 with five loaves of bread and two fish. </p>
<p> Historically, fish shapes were also used by Christians to identify one another. </p>
<p> For those following the tradition in Kent, the county is blessed with a lengthy strip of coast that offers up plenty of fresh fish. </p>
<p> As it happens, it's not just fish that has been banned by religion on Good Friday in the past. </p>
<p> Betting was a no-go and bookies' shops were not allowed to open on the day until 2008. </p>
<p> There was also no racing on the religious day until 2014. </p>

<p> Ways Eating Fruit Can Help You Lose Weight, Say Dietitians </p>
<p> An apple a day can keep the doctor (and unwanted weight gain) away. </p>
<p> Cherries, grapes, white peaches. Bananas, apricots, cantaloupe. Watermelon, apples, pears. We could go on and on, but we'll get to the heart of it: Fruit is refreshing, delicious, and affordable. It's also really darn good for you and can help amp up your weight loss efforts—big time. To that end, we tapped dietitians to share all the amazing ways fruit can fill you up and slim you down. Read on, and for more on how to eat healthy, don't miss 15 Underrated Weight Loss Tips That Actually Work. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Fruit helps you feel fuller for longer. </p>
<p> "Fruit is low in calories but high in nutrients including fiber, which helps you feel full not just for the short term, but for many hours between meals. This often leads to less calories eaten and can therefore help manage your weight," comments Joanna Foley, RD, CLT. </p>
<p> Speaking of filling up, not all fruits are created equal. What's one of your best bets for filling up between or during meals to curb overeating? Every millennials' favorite: Avocados. "Avocados are one of the highest-fiber fruits and also have the benefit of providing healthy fats which also helps keep you full," she says, noting that there are many ways to load up on avocados from slipping them into smoothies to adding them to sandwiches as a healthy, satiating topping. </p>
<p> Fruits with a high flavonoid content may help you avoid packing on pounds. </p>
<p> "Eating fruit high in flavonoids may help with weight control and limit weight gain. Several classes of flavonoids have been shown to decrease energy intake which can assist with weight loss," says Tara Tomaino, RD, Registered Dietitian at The Park, a New Jersey-based work-life campus that offers wellness and concierge services, from The Connell Company. Just check out this research. "Strawberries and blueberries are two fruits high in flavonoids that should be included in a healthy diet. Add these richly colored berries to your day by topping oatmeal, cereal, or yogurt with sliced strawberries. Frozen berries are great added to a bowl of Greek yogurt or to a whole grain muffin mix," she adds. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Fruit improves insulin sensitivity. </p>
<p> "The fiber in fruit causes your blood sugar to not spike so much [compared to meals that don't contain fiber after eating] and makes your body respond better to insulin. Improved insulin sensitivity helps manage your weight," says Foley. "Berries are particularly great for balancing blood sugar and burning fat, and can be easily added to smoothies, oatmeal, yogurt, or eaten by themselves for a delicious and nutritious treat." Already a berry aficionado? These are the best states for berry picking. </p>
<p> Eating fruit can help reinforce other healthy decisions you're making. </p>
<p> Kick off a cycle of habits beneficial for you by making an effort to eat fruit every single day. "Making healthy choices (such as eating fruit) can often increase motivation to make other healthy lifestyle changes, which add up and can promote weight loss over time," comments Diana Gariglio-Clelland, RD, dietitian for Next Luxury. For some of the best weight-loss-friendly fruits, check out the nine best fruits for weight loss, approved by a nutritionist. </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Fruits can help curb your sweet tooth. </p>
<p> Instead of reaching for that pint of sorbet after dinner, a handful of frozen grapes may very well do the trick—without added sugar and with plenty of antioxidants and other polyphenols, says Toby Amidor, MS, RD, CDN, FAND award-winning nutrition expert and partner with Grapes from California. "Instead of soda, which is the number one way Americans get added sugar, replace it with a fruit smoothie," she also suggests. </p>
<p> Echoing Amidor, Gariglio-Clelland shares "fruit is naturally rich in sugar, making it a sweet alternative for added sugars in traditional desserts. Swapping ice cream for berries with a splash of cream is a decadent but more healthy treat, as is a fresh fruit smoothie without added sugars." Berries and cream coming right up, you don't have to tell us twice. </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> Fruit helps promote a healthy gut microbiome. </p>
<p> Mmmm, bring on the good-for-you gut bacteria. "Eating fruit can improve the diversity of your gut bacteria, which research shows plays an important role in weight management," comments Foley. "Apples contain a type of prebiotic fiber that helps feed the healthy bacteria in your gut," she adds, noting that some excellent ways to enjoy apples if you're not just chomping down on a whole fruit include slicing them into salads or oatmeal. </p>
<p> Watermelon, in particular, may help you drop pounds. </p>
<p> Many fruits are good for your waistline, but let's hear it for this summer favorite. "Watermelon, when consumed as a part of an overall anti-inflammatory diet may support weight loss. Participants in a study who consumed a more anti-inflammatory diet including watermelon experienced a reduction in body fat," says Tomaino, pointing to this research. "The high water content of watermelon promotes a feeling of fullness which may prevent overeating. Whip up a salad with watermelon, feta cheese, and mint leaves or blend watermelon with ice and lime juice to create a refreshing slushie," she suggests. </p>

<p> Eat Fruit Until Noon </p>
<p> Eat Fruit until Noon. That's a thing?! Yes, that's a real thing. I try to follow the Jesse Itzler fruit diet. It's pretty simple just eat only fruit until noon. Read more about the science of eating only fruit until noon. </p>
<p> Jesse Itzler Fruit Diet </p>
<p> This is how I started eating only fruit until noon. </p>
<p> A few years ago I attended the 10X Growth Conference in Miami, Florida hosted by Grant Cardone. One of the speakers was Jesse Itzler. Jesse is a self-made multi-millionaire. He's married to Spanx Founder Sara Blakely. </p>
<p> Jesse impressed me not because he's got a ton a money, but because of the way he lives his life. He has written a couple of really phenomenal books you should read. Living with a Seal is my favorite. This is where Jesse learns not to let any external force get in the way of a work out. It helps him to achieve intense results. Living with the Monks is interesting. Jesse goes and lives with Monks for a few weeks. His goal is to find out how they meditate and find peace. I think this book is interesting because it exemplifies how a person can find peace in any situation and no special circumstances are needed to achieve enlightment. </p>
<p> He helps people build their life resume. Jesse's main motivations in life lies in being a better person, not making more money. Although, I'm going to assume he likes making money. His course, Build Your Life Resume, helps people to make a meaningful life instead of a pre-determined life. </p>
<p> Jesse Itzler eats only fruit until noon. He shared this at the 10X Growth Conference. I was like what? But it made a lot of sense. Jesse was profiled on CNBC for his eat only fruit until noon diet. He says it helps him stay healthy and perform at the level of an elite athlete. Follow him on Instagram to watch him obtain massive fitness goals. </p>
<p> Eat Fruit for Breakfast </p>
<p> The acai bowl is one of the easiest vegan breakfasts on the plant. This acai bowl has all the fruit you need for breakfast. The rule is simple, just eat only fruit until breakfast. Acai bowls are an awesome way to eat fruit until noon. </p>
<p> Cut up fruit you have on hand. In the photo I've used Nectarines, Strawberries, Banana, and Blue Berries </p>
<p> Use a frozen acai packet from any grocery. Most are going to have this in the frozen foods isle. I've even found them at Safeway and Kroger. They are always available at Sprouts and Whole Foods. </p>
<p> Add to your blender: frozen acai packet, 1/2 a banana, a little maple syrup or agave if you'd like. For a soupier consistency add a bit of almond milk. </p>
<p> Blend in a few short bursts until you reach the consistency you like. </p>
<p> Pour acai in a bowl and top with cut fruit. I also topped it with these pepitas, I like to buy them on amazon because they are way less expensive and higher quality. </p>
<p> Enjoy! </p>
<p> The Best Blender for Acai Bowls </p>
<p> This ninja blender is perfect for acai bowls </p>
<p> Everyone knows the Vitamix is the Cadillac of Blenders, but I like to do my Acai Bowls in a smaller wattage, easier to get everything out blender. The best blender for acai bowls is the 400 Watt Ninja. </p>
<p> The Vitamix can be difficult to get everything out of the bottom. It also does just too smooth of a job for an acai bowl. This is where the mini Ninja shines. The smaller ninja is easy to take all the parts out of and allows you to get every single bit of acai out. It will allow you to do a single serving. The Vitamix is just too powerful a machine for this little job. I cannot reccomend using the 400 Watt Ninja for your acai bowls. </p>

<p> If you’re used to eating with cutlery, eating Indian food with your hands can be an intimidating concept. Fortunately, eating with your hands doesn't have to be a messy, uncomfortable experience. By following a few simple etiquette rules and learning how to eat different foods with your hands, you can sit down and confidently enjoy a traditional Indian meal. </p>
<p> Wash your hands before you eat. You want to ensure your hands are completely clean before you sit down for your meal.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> Eat with your right hand only. In Indian culture, the left hand is commonly viewed as dirty and unsanitary, and therefore rude to eat with. Avoid serving, eating, or touching any of the food with your left hand.[2] X Research source </p>
<p> Use only your fingers to pick up food. Avoid letting the food touch your palms. Hold the food near the tips of your fingers when you're bringing it to your mouth.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> Take bites of one dish at a time. It's custom to sample each dish individually. This goes for any main dishes and side dishes but does not include the bread, rice, or daal.[4] X Research source </p>
<p> For example, you wouldn't mix a vegetable dish with a meat dish in the same bite, or eat one of the side dishes with one of the main dishes in the same bite. </p>
<p> Take a small serving from each of the main dishes and side dishes. Traditionally you will be offered vegetables and meat as the main dishes, along with side dishes like pickles and papad.[5] X Research source </p>
<p> Break off a small piece of bread. Try to get a piece that's about 1 x 1.5 inches (2.5 x 3.8 cm). Place the bread over one of the main dishes on your plate.[6] X Research source </p>
<p> You can use the bread as a tool to break apart pieces of food on your plate that are too large to eat. Just place the bread over a piece of food and press down to break it into smaller pieces.[7] X Research source </p>
<p> Use the piece of bread to pick up food from a main dish. With the piece of bread resting over the vegetable or meat dish on your plate, fold the bread in half using your fingers, letting some of the food underneath get pinched in between the two halves of the bread. Bring your hand to your mouth and eat the bread.[8] X Research source </p>
<p> Use your fingers to try a side dish. Pick up a piece of food from a side dish and bring it to your mouth. Don't put your fingers in your mouth when you're eating it or lick them after you take a bite.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> Alternate between main dishes and side dishes until the bread is gone. Continue using the bread to pick up food from the main dishes. Eat a side dish in between each bite of a main dish.[10] X Research source </p>
<p> Serve yourself rice once you're finished with the bread. If you finished the main dishes on your plate, serve yourself some more to have with the rice.[11] X Research source </p>
<p> Pour some daal over your rice. Daal is a lentil-based stew traditionally served with rice.[12] X Research source Don’t go overboard with the daal at first; too much daal will make the rice mushy and hard to clump together. If your rice is bland or sticky, carefully add more daal until you like the taste and texture.[13] X Research source </p>
<p> Use your fingers to pack a portion of the rice into a ball. You can make the rice ball with just the rice and daal mixture, or you can pack in some of the main dishes too.[14] X Research source </p>
<p> Cup your hand like a spoon and pick up the rice ball. Position the rice ball near the tips of your four fingers, and hold it in place using your thumb.[15] X Research source </p>
<p> Bring your hand with the rice ball to your mouth. The palm of your hand should be face up, with the rice ball directly in front of your mouth.[16] X Research source </p>
<p> Use your thumb to push the rice ball into your mouth. Make sure you get all of the rice off your fingertips using your thumb.[17] X Research source </p>
<p> Alternate between eating the rice and side dishes until the rice is gone. Serve yourself more of the main dishes, side dishes, or rice if you run out at any point during the meal.[18] X Research source </p>
<p> Wash your hands after everyone has finished eating. Wash your hands in the sink if you’re at home or dining at someone else’s home. If you’re at a restaurant, wash your hands in one of the water bowls provided by your server.[19] X Research source </p>
<p> No. Rice is a type of grain, potatoes are vegetables. They are both carbohydrates, though. </p>

<p> Eating </p>
<p> "Eat" redirects here. For other uses of "eat", or "EAT" as an abbreviation or acronym, see EAT (disambiguation). </p>
<p> Amandines de Provence, poster by Leonetto Cappiello, 1900 </p>
<p> Eating (also known as consuming) is the ingestion of food, typically to provide a heterotrophic organism with energy and to allow for growth. Animals and other heterotrophs must eat in order to survive — carnivores eat other animals, herbivores eat plants, omnivores consume a mixture of both plant and animal matter, and detritivores eat detritus. Fungi digest organic matter outside their bodies as opposed to animals that digest their food inside their bodies. For humans, eating is an activity of daily living. Some individuals may limit their amount of nutritional intake. This may be a result of a lifestyle choice, due to hunger or famine, as part of a diet or as religious fasting. </p>
<p> Many homes have a large kitchen area devoted to preparation of meals and food, and may have a dining room, dining hall, or another designated area for eating. </p>
<p> Most societies also have restaurants, food courts, and food vendors so that people may eat when away from home, when lacking time to prepare food, or as a social occasion.[1] At their highest level of sophistication, these places become "theatrical spectacles of global cosmopolitanism and myth."[2] At picnics, potlucks, and food festivals, eating is in fact the primary purpose of a social gathering. At many social events, food and beverages are made available to attendees. </p>
<p> People usually have two or three meals a day.[3] Snacks of smaller amounts may be consumed between meals. Doctors in the UK recommend three meals a day (with between 400–600 kcal per meal),[4][5] with four to six hours between.[6] Having three well-balanced meals (described as: half of the plate with vegetables, 1/4 protein food as meat, [...] and 1/4 carbohydrates as pasta, rice)[7] will then amount to some 1800–2000 kcal, which is the average requirement for a regular person.[8] </p>
<p> Newborn babies do not eat adult foods. They survive solely on breast milk or formula.[12] Small amounts of pureed food are sometimes fed to young infants as young as two or three months old, but most infants do not eat adult food until they are between six and eight months old. Young babies eat pureed baby foods because they have few teeth and immature digestive systems. Between 8 and 12 months of age, the digestive system improves, and many babies begin eating finger foods. Their diet is still limited, however, because most babies lack molars or canines at this age, and often have a limited number of incisors. By 18 months, babies often have enough teeth and a sufficiently mature digestive system to eat the same foods as adults. Learning to eat is a messy process for children, and children often do not master neatness or eating etiquette until they are five or six years old. </p>
<p> Eating positions </p>
<p> Eating positions vary according to the different regions of the world, as culture influences the way people eat their meals. For example, most of the Middle Eastern countries, eating while sitting on the floor is most common, and it is believed to be healthier than eating while sitting to a table.[13][14] </p>
<p> Compulsive overeating </p>
<p> Compulsive overeating, or emotional eating, is "the tendency to eat in response to negative emotions".[17] Empirical studies have indicated that anxiety leads to decreased food consumption in people with normal weight and increased food consumption in the obese.[18] </p>
<p> Many laboratory studies showed that overweight individuals are more emotionally reactive and are more likely to overeat when distressed than people of normal weight. Furthermore, it was consistently found that obese individuals experience negative emotions more frequently and more intensively than do normal weight persons.[19] </p>
<p> The naturalistic study by Lowe and Fisher compared the emotional reactivity and emotional eating of normal and overweight female college students. The study confirmed the tendency of obese individuals to overeat, but these findings applied only to snacks, not to meals. That means that obese individuals did not tend to eat more while having meals; rather, the amount of snacks they ate between meals was greater. One possible explanation that Lowe and Fisher suggest is obese individuals often eat their meals with others and do not eat more than average due to the reduction of distress because of the presence of other people. Another possible explanation would be that obese individuals do not eat more than the others while having meals due to social desirability. Conversely, snacks are usually eaten alone.[19] </p>
<p> Initiation </p>
<p> German Shepherd puppy eating out of a human hand </p>
<p> There are numerous signals given off that initiate hunger. There are environmental signals, signals from the gastrointestinal system, and metabolic signals that trigger hunger. The environmental signals come from the body's senses. The feeling of hunger could be triggered by the smell and thought of food, the sight of a plate, or hearing someone talk about food.[22] The signals from the stomach are initiated by the release of the peptide hormone ghrelin. Ghrelin is a hormone that increases appetite by signaling to the brain that a person is hungry.[23] </p>
<p> Environmental signals and ghrelin are not the only signals that initiate hunger, there are other metabolic signals as well. As time passes between meals, the body starts to take nutrients from long-term reservoirs.[22] When the glucose levels of cells drop (glucoprivation), the body starts to produce the feeling of hunger. The body also stimulates eating by detecting a drop in cellular lipid levels (lipoprivation).[22] Both the brain and the liver monitor the levels of metabolic fuels. The brain checks for glucoprivation on its side of the blood–brain barrier (since glucose is its fuel), while the liver monitors the rest of the body for both lipoprivation and glucoprivation.[24] </p>
<p> Termination </p>
<p> There are short-term signals of satiety that arise from the head, the stomach, the intestines, and the liver. The long-term signals of satiety come from adipose tissue.[22] The taste and odor of food can contribute to short-term satiety, allowing the body to learn when to stop eating. The stomach contains receptors to allow us to know when we are full. The intestines also contain receptors that send satiety signals to the brain. The hormone cholecystokinin is secreted by the duodenum, and it controls the rate at which the stomach is emptied.[25] This hormone is thought to be a satiety signal to the brain. Peptide YY 3-36 is a hormone released by the small intestine and it is also used as a satiety signal to the brain.[26] Insulin also serves as a satiety signal to the brain. The brain detects insulin in the blood, which indicates that nutrients are being absorbed by cells and a person is getting full. Long-term satiety comes from the fat stored in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue secretes the hormone leptin, and leptin suppresses appetite. Long-term satiety signals from adipose tissue regulates short-term satiety signals.[22] </p>
<p> Role of the brain </p>
<p> The brain stem can control food intake, because it contains neural circuits that detect hunger and satiety signals from other parts of the body.[22] The brain stem's involvement of food intake has been researched using rats. Rats that have had the motor neurons in the brain stem disconnected from the neural circuits of the cerebral hemispheres (decerebration), are unable to approach and eat food.[22] Instead they have to obtain their food in a liquid form. This research shows that the brain stem does in fact play a role in eating. </p>
<p> There are two peptides in the hypothalamus that produce hunger, melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin. MCH plays a bigger role in producing hunger. In mice, MCH stimulates feeding and a mutation causing the overproduction of MCH led to overeating and obesity.[27] Orexin plays a greater role in controlling the relationship between eating and sleeping. Other peptides in the hypothalamus that induce eating are neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AGRP).[22] </p>
<p> Satiety in the hypothalamus is stimulated by leptin. Leptin targets the receptors on the arcuate nucleus and suppresses the secretion of MCH and orexin. The arcuate nucleus also contains two more peptides that suppress hunger. The first one is cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), the second is α-MSH (α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone).[22] </p>
<p> A chronic lack of nutritious food can cause various illnesses, and will eventually lead to starvation. When this happens in a locality on a massive scale, it is considered a famine. </p>
<p> Other animals </p>
<p> Mammals </p>
<p> To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive—mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals—this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum.[30] Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested.[31]:131–137 An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.[32] </p>
<p> The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type (Allen's rule). Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about 18 ounces (510 g; 1.1 lb) are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of an herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (carnivores that feed on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores).[33] Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than 18 ounces (510 g; 1.1 lb) usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects (ants or termites).[34] </p>
<p> Some mammals are omnivores and display varying degrees of carnivory and herbivory, generally leaning in favor of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous.[36] They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50–70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, and in some cases strong jaws for bone-crushing, as in the case of hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.[35] </p>
<p> Some physiological carnivores consume plant matter and some physiological herbivores consume meat. From a behavioral aspect, this would make them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, this may be due to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification.[37] For example, it is well documented that some ungulates such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients.[38] Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.[39] </p>
<p> Many mammals, in the absence of sufficient food requirements in an environment, suppress their metabolism and conserve energy in a process known as hibernation.[40] In the period preceding hibernation, larger mammals, such as bears, become polyphagic to increase fat stores, whereas smaller mammals prefer to collect and stash food.[41] The slowing of the metabolism is accompanied by a decreased heart and respiratory rate, as well as a drop in internal temperatures, which can be around ambient temperature in some cases. For example, the internal temperatures of hibernating arctic ground squirrels can drop to −2.9 °C (26.8 °F), however the head and neck always stay above 0 °C (32 °F).[42] A few mammals in hot environments aestivate in times of drought or extreme heat, for example the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius).[43] </p>
<p> Birds </p>
<p> Birds' diets are varied and often include nectar, fruit, plants, seeds, carrion, and various small animals, including other birds.[44] The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth.[45] Some species such as pigeons and some psittacine species do not have a gallbladder.[46] Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight.[47] Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein stored in many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.[48] </p>
<p> Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists.[44] Avian foraging strategies can vary widely by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes.[49] Combined, insectivorous birds eat 400–500 million metric tons of arthropods annually.[50] </p>
<p> Some species, including frigatebirds, gulls,[56] and skuas,[57] engage in kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%.[58] Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.[59] </p>

<p> How to Dine out Safely With a Shellfish Allergy </p>
<p> Victoria Groce is a medical writer living with celiac disease who specializes in writing about dietary management of food allergies. </p>
<p> Daniel More, MD, is a board-certified allergist and clinical immunologist. He is an assistant clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and currently practices at Central Coast Allergy and Asthma in Salinas, California. </p>
<p> With any food allergy comes a level of anxiety about eating, and especially eating out. It's natural and expected to feel some stress and fear when a certain food becomes a danger to you—in fact, it would be strange if you didn't have anxiety! But you don't have to settle for a lower quality of life due to a food allergy, and you don't have to live in fear. With the right guidelines and preparation, eating out can still be a safe, enjoyable experience for you. </p>
<p> Shellfish allergies are, in some ways, one of the easier "big eight" most common food allergies to live with, given that seafood isn't nearly as pervasive an ingredient as, for example, dairy or nuts. But because shellfish allergies tend to be so severe when they are triggered, and they carry the unfortunate risk of anaphylaxis, it's vital to take proper precautions when eating outside of your home. </p>
<p> Certain cuisines and dishes are riskier than others, and your best defense is information. Thankfully, there are many steps you can take to protect yourself. </p>
<p> Know the Safest Spots </p>
<p> The two safest types of restaurants for shellfish allergies are strict kosher restaurants and dedicated vegan or vegetarian restaurants, which forbid shellfish. German cuisine and Eastern European cuisine are other common cuisines that use less shellfish than many (though both do include fish). </p>
<p> Even when eating at a restaurant without visible shellfish on the menu, however, be sure to discuss your allergies, as shellfish may be used in stocks or as a garnish. </p>
<p> Stay Away From High-Risk Cuisines </p>
<p> Some types of restaurants are riskier than others because of cross-contamination issues or because a high percentage of dishes on the menu may include shellfish. These include seafood restaurants and sushi bars (which may store fish and shellfish in very close proximity, or which may use the same knives on both types of seafood), Cajun restaurants, and Chinese restaurants that specialize in seafood. </p>
<p> Be wary, too, of sharing tapas with friends, as much traditional tapas include shellfish and sharing dishes could be a major cross-contamination risk. </p>
<p> Check the Menu Online Beforehand </p>
<p> Before eating at a chain restaurant, be sure to check their website, as many now include information for the most common food allergens, including shellfish. While checking the website is no substitute for talking to onsite staff about your allergies and about cross-contamination concerns, website information can give you a good idea of whether you'll be able to find suitable options at a given restaurant, or whether some options that look safe really are. </p>
<p> Speak with Your Server and Chef When You Arrive </p>
<p> Make sure your server and the chef aware of your allergies when you arrive. They should know about the risks of cross-contamination and assure you that your food will be cooked in a shellfish-free area, on grills or pans that have not been used to cook shellfish. You can also visit the Food Allergy Research and Education organization's website and download a "food allergy alert chef card" which you can give to your server to pass to the chef.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Get to Know Cuisines From Around the World </p>
<p> American Cuisine. In addition to dishes like fried shrimp, surf'n'turf, or steamed mussels that clearly indicate shellfish, several traditional American dishes are made with shellfish. </p>
<p> Cioppino, a soup originating in San Francisco, is made from seafood and other shellfish. New England boiled dinners and Low Country boil both usually include shellfish. Be safe and ask before ordering. </p>
<p> Cajun specialties like gumbo and jambalaya are usually made from shellfish, and seafood muffuletta sandwiches may be found in coastal areas. </p>
<p> Finally, ask about the possibility of small shrimp being used to garnish salads. </p>
<p> Latin American Cuisine. Shellfish is not as prevalent in Mexican and Central American restaurants as in some other cuisines, but some restaurants do serve enchiladas or tacos with shrimp fillings, or shrimp versions of traditional Snapper Veracruz. </p>
<p> Ask about cross-contamination before ordering. Brazilian and Peruvian cookery features more shellfish, especially ceviche (fish or shellfish "cooked" by marinating it in citrus juice). Be wary of any Latin American dish with "mariscos" in the name, as this is the Spanish word for "seafood." </p>
<p> French and Western European Cuisine. Shrimp, prawns, lobster, and other shellfish feature prominently in French food and in the cuisine of the Mediterranean, so before eating at a Continental restaurant, it's wise to call ahead and make sure they can accommodate your allergies. </p>
<p> You should know that any French dish served "à l'Americaine" comes with a topping of lobster. Likewise, "crevettes," on a French or Continental menu always indicates shrimp. Italian cuisine may feature mussels or shrimp but will often include safe options on the menu. Greek cuisine, likewise, features a lot of fish but comparatively little shellfish beyond octopus. </p>
<p> Middle Eastern and Indian Cuisine. Shellfish is not a prominent part of Middle Eastern cooking, especially Lebanese (one of the more common types of Middle Eastern restaurants you're likely to find in many parts of America). However, you may find mussels or other steamed shellfish on the menu. </p>
<p> Indian restaurants vary greatly depending on which part of the country their cuisine is from. Many Indian restaurants are vegetarian and therefore safe. Cuisine from Goa, with its strong Portuguese influence, is more likely than others to contain shellfish. </p>
<p> East Asian Cuisine. Most popular East Asian cuisines—Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and Malaysian—include shellfish as a major part of their menus, so always check out the menu before going to one of these restaurants. </p>
<p> Hong Kong hot pots frequently include shellfish, though vegetarian and meat-based varieties do exist. In addition to asking about shellfish in the dishes themselves, be aware of the possibility of shellfish in condiments, stocks, and other hidden sources. </p>
<p> Chinese dried shrimp, Thai kapi and nam prik, and Vietnamese mam tom are among the condiments and sauces that always include shellfish. </p>
<p> Bring Your Rescue Medication Anyway </p>
<p> Even if you've followed all these steps and feel at ease about eating at a particular restaurant, always make sure you're prepared for emergencies. That means taking your rescue medication (epinephrine autoinjector and, if applicable, any asthma medication) with you. While it is unlikely that you'll need it, especially while taking all of these precautions, it's always possible—and carrying it with you can offer the peace of mind you need to truly kick back and enjoy your meal. </p>

<p> Find out how to </p>
<p> What does the Bible say about eating/drinking blood? </p>
<p> Answer </p>
<p> In Acts 10, the apostle Peter began to realize just how different this new Christianity was from Judaism. While praying on a rooftop, waiting for lunch, he had a vision. A sheet was lowered from heaven, containing many different types of animals. A voice encouraged him to eat. Peter balked, realizing that some of the animals in the sheet were forbidden under Jewish law. Three times the sheet lowered, and three times Peter refused. </p>
<p> The vision had a dual purpose. The most obvious was that, under the New Covenant, the ceremonial rules about dietary restrictions had been lifted. Christians are to be set apart and recognized by their love (John 13:35), not by their lunches. The second, and deeper, meaning was that Christ’s salvation was open to Gentiles just as it was to Jews. Immediately after the vision, Peter received a visit by messengers from a (Gentile) centurion named Cornelius who was ready to accept Christ. </p>
<p> Carnivorous Christians know and enjoy the message of Peter’s vision. But the vision does not directly address the subject of eating blood, unless that’s included in the revocation of kosher law. </p>
<p> The Bible’s first prohibition against consuming blood comes in Genesis 9:2-4, where God tells Noah, "Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything. But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it." This prohibition was most likely a ban on eating raw blood (i.e., uncooked meat). For the first time, animals were an allowable food source, and God was making sure that Noah did not eat them raw. A Jewish Targum comments on this verse: "But the flesh which is torn from a living beast at the time that its life is in it, or which is torn from a beast while it is slain, before all its breath is gone out, ye shall not eat." </p>
<p> Later, the prohibition of Genesis 9:4 is iterated in the Law of Moses. Leviticus 17:14 gives the reason behind command: “For the life of every creature is its blood: its blood is its life.” </p>
<p> It’s important to understand that New Testament believers in Christ have freedom from the Law, and we are to “stand firm” in that liberty (Galatians 5:1). We are not under the Law but under grace. “Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink” (Colossians 2:16). So, eating a rare steak, blood sausage, blood pancakes, blood soup, or blood tofu may not be palatable to all Christians, but it is allowable. </p>
<p> There is another passage to consider. In Acts 15, a question arose in the early church concerning what was necessary for salvation. Specifically, did a Gentile need to be circumcised in order to be saved (verse 1)? The issue came up in the church in Syrian Antioch, which had a mixture of Jewish and Gentile converts. To address this important issue, the leaders of the church met in Jerusalem for the very first church council. They concluded that, no, Gentiles did not need to follow Mosaic Law; circumcision is not part of salvation (verse 19). However, in verse 29, the leaders compose a letter with these instructions for the Gentiles in Antioch: “You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things.” At this point, we must keep the context foremost in our minds. These four commands from Jerusalem to Antioch all dealt with pagan practices associated with idolatry. Most, if not all, of the Gentile converts in Antioch were saved out of paganism. The church leaders were exhorting the new Gentile believers to make a clean break from their old lifestyles and not offend their Jewish brothers and sisters in the church. The instructions were not intended to guarantee salvation but to promote peace within the early church. </p>
<p> Later, Paul dealt with the same issue. It is perfectly all right to eat meat offered to idols, he says. “Nothing is unclean in itself” (Romans 14:14). But if eating that meat causes a brother in Christ to violate his conscience, Paul “will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall” (1 Corinthians 8:13). This was the same concern the Jerusalem leaders had in Acts 15: if the Gentile believers ate meat with the blood in it, the Jewish believers might be tempted to violate their conscience and join them in the feast. One’s conscience is a sacred thing, and we dare not act against it (see 1 Corinthians 8:7-12 and Romans 14:5). </p>
<p> In short, ordering your steak rare or well done is a matter of conscience and of taste. What enters the mouth does not make us unclean (see Matthew 15:17-18). Eating black pudding may not appeal to everyone, but it is not a sin. We live under grace. We have liberty in Christ. Others may have different convictions about food and drink, and in that case we voluntarily limit our freedom in order to better serve them and God. “Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification” (Romans 14:19). </p>

<p> Eating Fish Scraps and Fish Guts- A Kitchen Experiment </p>
<p> This post wasn't what I'd originally intended to write on my blog today, but that'll have to wait for another day, because I just did some very frugal, slightly crazy, but very rewarding things today, both while out, and in my kitchen, and I wanted to write it up already to share with you. I know, if you already read the title of the post, you know a good chunk of what I'm going to be sharing, (I write it that way to help Google searchers find me) but lets pretend that you didn't see that yet, so I can get into this post slowly but surely, so I don't scare you off before even reading it. So, first off, as you probably already guessed, this post is not for squeamish people, or die hard vegans. (If you fit into that category, consider yourself warned. There are lots of pics in this post. ) Nor is it for stuck up food snobs who think that people who eat "low brow food" are "less than". Not that I'm worried that any of my usual readers are food snobs, but I just still had to have that disclaimer. So, today, I went to town to buy some sardines to make my own homemade fish sauce. There are at least 10 fish mongers with stalls in the open air/farmer's market, and I wanted to do some price comparisons before I bought my sardines. </p>
<p> These are the fish heads I found... </p>
<p> As I was nearly at the market, as I was passing by the market's dumpster, I saw workers wheeling their carts of garbage to the dumpster. In the cart was a styrofoam box, and in that box, I saw this huuuuuuuge fish head looking at me. "Hey- why is this getting thrown out?" I wondered to myself. "Oh yea. Duh. People here don't eat fish heads. That's why." I asked permission, and "stole" the fish head- which turned out to be attached to a long skeleton and tail, as well as another fish head and skeleton, and another fish skeleton. All carp, I'm pretty sure. (If its not carp, I don't mind if someone corrects me and tells me what type of fish it is.) First off- in case you're wondering why I wasn't worried about the sanitariness of rescuing raw fish from the trash- the box that the fish was in was a box from the fish monger, filled only with fish parts, no other garbage. And it smelled totally fresh and fine, and there were no flies or anything nearby. There was nothing wrong with it. Just no one wanted it. So they tossed it. As do most of the fish stores in the market. I also knew that even if they were sitting out for a while, it was pretty cold out today, so they couldn't possibly have reached a temperature warm enough for bacteria to start breeding. And another thing- I washed the fish heads and skeletons off very well when I came home... And then cooked it. Now, what would I do with that fish head and skeleton? Why would I even want it, when obviously no one else does (or else it wouldn't have been thrown out)? Well, I got my idea predominantly from Jeff Yeager's performance in "Extreme Cheapskates". In Jeff's segment of the show, he wants to make a nice cheap meal for the family hosting him, and he makes what he calls "salmon carcass soup", which was basically made from the same parts of fish that I found heading to the trash- the heads and bones and tails- only salmon, and mine was carp. No reason why I couldn't do the same thing! There is a ton of meat on the bones, and a lot within the head- the meal could be more than just broth. P.S. I know I wrote in my post on Extreme Cheapskates that I had a problem with him serving fish carcass soup to his hosting family, but my issue is less with what he served and more with what he called it- he could have very easily just taken the meat off the bone and put it in the soup, and just called it salmon soup (the word carcass makes people think of rotting flesh being pecked at by vultures, not of yummy food)- spared the grossed-out-ness and the squeamishness, but be just as frugal and just as delicious... Once I got in my head to try to make something with these fish scraps, I decided to try out asking the fish mongers directly for scraps. Maybe I'd strike lucky. And I did. Now, not every shop keeper is happy to give things away free, especially once he knows people want it. They'll throw it out, no problem- but ask them to have it, and they start getting second thoughts- "Hey, if people want it, maybe I should be charging for this..." Shop keepers are more willing to throw something free in to a customer who is paying, and are more willing to give you the time of day if you show you're a serious customer, so I decided that my modus operandi at the fish mongers would be to first ask about the prices of sardines, and once they answered that, then ask them if they have any fish scraps. A few places didn't have sardine or scraps, a few places had sardines but no scraps, one place apologized, said they just threw theirs out and had none left, a few gave me a dirty look, etc... But one guy gave me a bag of fish heads, fish bones, and some fish innards, and apologized saying that he wished he had more, but he was out, and if I came back later, he'd give me more... For that, for his politeness, he got my sale- I bought sardines from him even though they were a drop more expensive than in other places. I saw a fish monger with a bunch of salmon skeletons- he wouldn't be able to tell me that no, he didn't have any scraps... so I go to him asking him what he does with those bones, and he says he sells them. "Ok, so how much are they?" I ask, expecting to hear a low price. "$2.40 a pound" he tells me. Seriously. What a rip off... The fish monger in the stall right across from him gives me a bunch of salmon skins... And while I was at it, I asked a butcher in the market if he had any meat scraps- he gave me some chicken bones and skin (which I plan on using to make rendered chicken fat and soup- but this post is about fish scraps, not chicken scraps, even if they're related...). The one thing that annoyed me about this whole deal... Two things really... Firstly, that most of the shop keepers, when I asked them if they had any fish scraps, asked me if I had a cat. No, I don't have a cat- this is for me and my family. Why do people assume that these scraps are for a cat, when there are so many useful and yummy things to do with them for people? What am I supposed to answer, when they ask "So, this is for your cat?" "No, its for my family"? Anyhow... And I also didn't get why fish mongers glared at me when I asked them for scraps. I would have happily bought from them if they named me a low price. And I would have happily bought sardines from them if they were more polite to me... I'm not looking to steal from them... Not long after that, I passed by a sushi restaurant. Know what was on the menu? Salmon skin sushi! Ha! I got a bunch of free salmon skins! </p>
<p> So, when I got home, I washed off all the scraps I got, and put the salmon skin in the freezer for another date. I cleaned the fish heads, took out any innards that were attached to them, put them into a large pot, covered with water, and boiled to make stock. My friend Vera said that she was always told to take out the gills, because they make stock bitter, but I didn't bother... </p>
<p> While the fish heads and bones were cooking, I decided to see if I could do anything with the fish innards. I was always told that you throw away fish innards, because they taste so bitter and disgusting that no one wants to eat them. I once thought people were exaggerating about that, and tried boiling some innards to make stock, and learned that yes, it was disgusting. But all fish innards can't be all disgusting, I thought. For two reasons. Animal innards, aka organ meats, are edible- for the most part, fish have the same internal organs. There's no reason why the same organs that are edible in animals should be inedible in fish. And secondly, because there certainly are some fish internal organs that not only are eaten, but are considered either classy or expensive health foods, like caviar- fish eggs- and fish livers... Yes, I know that the caviar and livers commonly eaten aren't from every fish, but again, if they're edible in one fish, reason would say that they'd be edible in all the different types of fish... And I wanted to be able to eat their organs. Because organ meats tend to be the most nutritious type of meat, because that's where the body stores its nutrient stores. If I could get this nutritious for free from fish, then why not? So while my broth was cooking, I decided to do an experiment. Try and cook each internal organ of the fish separately, and see how it tasted. That way, if some were good and some weren't, I'd be able to pinpoint which was the culprit that was ruining everything else. </p>
<p> My research showed me that one of the biggest issues with fish innards is that the gallbladder secretes bitter, yellow/green bile, which ends up getting onto most of the other organs, making them taste terrible as well. The first step would be to wash the innards very well, to remove any of the bile. I then separated each type of organ from the rest, washed them off very well, and cooked them one by one. The first experiment was with the fish eggs, which I was 99% sure would be a success. I pan fried these in my cast iron skillet. The end result- yummy! Tasted like fishy hard boiled eggs. Next I tried what looked to be the heart or something similar. Pan fried they tasted very similar to chicken hearts. Delicious. Tasted the least fishy to me of everything I ate tonight. Next was what I assume to be lungs. They might be liver though. Pan fried they were soft and creamy and delicious, making me want more and more of them. They reminded me in taste of cod livers. Then what I think is fish liver. Pan fried, they tasted very similar to the canned cod livers I've eaten. They were terrific. Creamy and soft and yummy. Then I tried the fish internal fat. I suspected this would be problematic, as it was around the intestines and bile, and I had to separate them from the bile and the intestines, soaked them in water a few times, and then tried rendering it like I render chicken fat... The fat was being rendered, but apparently I wasn't able to wash off enough of the bile, because it tasted bitter. I tossed it... Then I decided my last attempt would be intestines. I sliced a short piece open, washed out the inside and outside. Oh wait- you're saying why eat intestines? Isn't that gross? Not to me- my culture traditionally ate stuffed chicken intestines, and probably so did yours- sausage was traditionally made in chicken intestines! So yea, back to fish intestines- I just wanted to make sure they were very clean first, which is why I sliced it open prior to washing and soaking.... Cooked, it shriveled up and curled up, and tasted fine, no strong taste. Had a bit of a bite too it, but wasn't too chewy. I tried with the rest and got something that looked like calamari (I think) or noodles. These were slightly slightly slightly bitter- I think I just need to wash them better next time. Ok, so back to the broth. I took out one fish head, already with the skin falling off the bone. I picked out the meat from the fish head, and sticking the bones and cartilage and skin back into the soup pot to cook more. Here's the inside of the fish head. The fish meat from the head was absolutely delicious. So creamy and soft, it felt like I was eating butter. It melts in your mouth like pudding, and has such a perfect taste that even without any salt, it was perfect. The gills and the areas around it weren't bitter at all. Two noteworthy organs in the fish's head- Fish tongue. Soft and delicious, reminded me a little of cow tongue, but not completely. And what I thought was fish brain, but I'm not 100% sure- it was brown, and actually was stringy and had the texture of beef. Yummy, but was weird to feel like I was eating beef when I knew it was really fish. Here's the fish I got out of just one head! Here's the bones from just one head! Here's all the meat I got off of all the bones that I got free- a total of 3.5 pounds of pure meat! And delicious! I have a big soup pot filled with the bones, set to cook overnight. This food is sooo great! First off, I'm really appreciative for 3.5 pounds of free fish meat, which I plan on using to make fish chowder or fish curry. Secondly, it saddens me to know that every day, this type of food goes into the trash. It is the best part of the fish! Why are we so wasteful??? Thirdly, the world ought to know that fish heads have the softest, yummiest, most delicious and perfect meat- I'd gladly forgo all other fish and just eat head meat my whole life, it's that great... Fourth, I'm glad I experimented with the fish innards. Now I know I don't need to throw out the whole thing- just the gallbladder/spleen, air bladder, and fat. I'm sorry if I grossed you out with any of the pictures- I was just so excited about my discovery about all this free and delicious fish! Are you an adventurous eater? How adventurous? Adventurous enough to eat fish head stock? To eat fish heads? Adventurous enough to eat fish guts? Adventurous enough to "dumpster dive"/rescue fish scraps and cook them to eat them? What do you think of my experiment? Be honest- did it gross you out, or intrigue you and make you want to try these yourself? (P.S. I won't be offended if you say you were grossed out. Its understandable. Even my husband had mixed feelings at first, and then decided that the food was yummy.) What was the kitchen experiment you did that you were most surprised about the results? Anyone have a good fish chowder or fish curry recipe? </p>

<p> Awesome post! Thanks for experimenting with the organs, everyone that had told me to toss the organs were American so i was hesitant to believe the same people who only eat the muscle meat of cow. Waste not want not! If an animal dies so I can eat it, i want to be sure i am utilizing it as efficiently as i can. </p>
<p> Im going to my closest fish market and do the same...organs are so much better and healthier for you even the bitter part with the bile...so beneficial for digestion... </p>

<p> I am so happy to read this! A new acquaintance brought a flounder he had just caught down the street (we live by the ocean). I don't have knives and other stuff that most people need to clean fish, and everything I read about cleaning fish looked like a lot of work. So I googled "cook fish with guts in" and landed on your article. I realize you cooked all the guts separately, but I had already put the fish into my solar oven whole. I was worried til I read your article - apparently there is at least a chance that I will end up with something edible! (tho the area around the gallbladder may be bitter). Keeping fingers crossed! We all need to experiment - it's a great thing for the progress of the human race. Thank you for your "gutsy" attitude! :-) </p>
<p> Next time you get a fish, try cleaning it with a regular fork against the scales and cut tge fish open with a knife... Tastes better, way better </p>
<p> Update: I just took the baked fish out of the solar oven and tasted the flesh - delicious! I will probably try the liver and some of the other organs too. </p>
<p> Thanks, this is just as I suspected. I was planning to try something similar in the future. It's helpful to know that you can get some of these guts and heads and other parts from the sellers for free or cheap. I will know what to avoid now (bitter bile). </p>
<p> I feel a little courageous after reading this... I have to build up the courage to deal with the inner organs (although I guess I shouldn't really have any more issue with it than with internal organs of chicken or beef). </p>
<p> The heads I've had before (salmon specifically), and like you said, the cheek is one of the most delicious parts of the fish! If I buy a whole salmon, I always ask them to give me the head, skin and skeleton even if I'm having it made into fillets. It hadn't occurred to me to ask for the innards though until now. </p>
<p> good to know. I wonder if you ever tried that yellow stuff inside the lobster. I was told it is a delicatessen and I tried myself. It tasted good. </p>
<p> Brilliant. Where we are from we would deep fry all the internal parts, after proper cleaning off course, and sometimes add rice or brinjal to add volume. It is considered a delicacy there. </p>
<p> Hi Penny, fish don't have lungs, that was liver. Chinese (and perhaps Japanese) have dishes like fish head soup, deep fried eggs and lots more. Some fish have toxic innards and that's prolly why they are thrown away. just fyi. nice post btw. </p>
<p> Great post! I got the internal organs of red snapper i bought, and decided to do research first on how to prepare them. Your post is so educational, thank you. </p>
<p> Great post! I did try the salmon head yesterday that was very good. I wondered whether the fish liver is edible or not,my husband says the liver filters the blood maybe has poison. </p>
<p> They cook the intestines in a soup with octopus, shellfish, crab, and squid here in korea. The organs taste much better then i would have expected </p>
<p> I don't know if this is something that you'd be interested in, but the Ancient Romans actually used to produce a condiment called "garum" using fish guts and fish blood. I've never tried it, personally, but apparently for the Romans, this stuff was like (ketchup)^2--they put it on EVERYTHING, and it was enjoyed by virtually every segment of Roman society. Apparently, garum was also surprisingly nutritious, being high in protein and Vitamin B. </p>
<p> One word of warning though--garum preparation involves active fermentation, which means that it absolutely REEKS to produce. In fact, if I recall correctly, the Ancient Romans passed some of the very first zoning laws precisely for this reason, prohibiting anyone from producing garum within a certain distance of the city limits. </p>
<p> we buy salmon heads at 8-10 USD per kg. we cook it in sour puree.. :) fried milk fish intestine is also good. grilled snake head intestine is also good once you get used to it :) </p>
<p> Thank you so much :) I always eat the fish I catch, but was told to throw out the innards. I once ate the liver and loved it, but was told that fish don't have livers which scared me off it. I am so excited to eat scrumptious fish head meat, have more fish (it always seems like there isn't enough), and not have to waste that meat. Yippee! </p>
<p> Hi! From Singapore, this post didn't gross me at all as over here in Singapore fish head curry is one Indian's delicacy. All different races love their fish head curry and there are even restaurants specialising in fish head curry. The Indians never throw the head and have them as part of their fish curry, either cooked in the curry or else fried with seasoning like chili powder, turmeric powder, a little lemon juice and salt.. Its super delicious! </p>
<p> I ate fish guts soup for dinner last night in St. Lucia, but nothing goes to waste here... Had fugu last week, not much gets wasted here. </p>
<p> I reckon those are silver carps' (the name is indeed misleading, since silver carp is not technically a carp) I bought a whole fish the other day, and tossed all the innards into he broth. The fishy taste can be do away with ginger. Also, fish gills are better in to thrown away, they have no taste and the texture really put me off. I am curious as to how is the percentage of flesh you can get from those heads. A typical silver does not have a high meat:bone ratio. </p>
<p> eating the organs and skin of most fish species is pretty un healthy for you. Fish naturally have an elevated amount of heavy metals due to the ecology of the aquatic envrionment. the bigger the fish the more heavy metals ususally. and the level of the heavy metals in the organ meat can be several hundred times greater than in the fish </p>
<p> I absolutely love how adventurous you are! I also do love eating innards of other animals - sticking to the red meats purely, as my mom hasn't welcomed fish guts (besides the eggs) as apart of our dining regime as they are rather unhealthy for you because of what the fishes injest. The facts on what parts of the fish and degree of affect on our body I do not know of, but I do encourage you to research a bit more, there may be some parts of the fish that may have a harmful effects to others. Keep up the posts! </p>
<p> The air bladder is actually used in Chinese cooking and is called fish ma. I have bought packs of trout ma and after seasoning it dehydrated it raw as a cracker, and it also can be baked for much the same thing. Wonderful treat! The Chinese use it in soups. Thank you so much for your experimentation and posting of your findings, you have done many people a great service! </p>
<p> brave experiment, You will never go hungry with your willingness to try. I googled this looking for help to using fish guts for cat food. :) </p>
<p> Be careful with fish organs. Not sure how many it applies to but I know there are a few with extremely toxic organs. A gar has eggs so toxic you have the completely avoid opening the body cavity on the off chance it is a pregnant female. </p>
<p> yeah when I was in Philippines with my gf, I was so exited to see how they waste nothing, and the fish heads are prozed meay, I agree its sooo yummy meat, went to a seafood place n the tuna cheek was the thing they were famous for and yup better tan any tuna steak I ever had </p>
<p> Its such a charm to know of people who are fascinated with fish intestines. I have been eating them since childhood. Its one of the delicacies of Northeast India. If you may, I'd like to share a recipe of the same which not only tastes amazing but u'll want to have it more frequently than a complete fish dish. First, i clean the innards very well under running water removing all the intestine tubes. So im just left with the fat mesh. I also remove the bile first hand. Then I clean the lungs, liver part and my most favourite part, the air sac. Remember to cut every part an inch siz e (coz when u cook, every part is going to dissolve except the air sac part which gives u a nice crunchy bite) So, here is the cooking part. Heat some oil in a wok (remember that the fat also dissolves). When the oil is warm, put the cleaned fish innards and stir till it is coated well with the oil. Immediately it'll start to sizzle and the air sac will Start to curl. Add in some salt and a pinch of turmeric powder and continue to stir making sure that it doesn't stick on the wok too much. Once the intestines have dissolved and it changes its color to dark grey/ brown, add half a cup of small diced onions and thinly diced green chillies. Continue to stir till a nice aroma comes ( you'll know when the raw fish smell goes away). You can check the salt as per taste at this point. Once you think its done taste wise and aroma wise, ur yummy fish innards is set to be a winner of ur dining table for the rest of ur life :) </p>
<p> You can increase or lessen the amount of onions and green chillies as per ur taste. </p>
<p> Japanese and Chinese people eat most of the things you ate. Unfortunately, I live in a community with many Asian fish markets and fish departments in supermarkets... so I suspect I can't get these parts for free. </p>
<p> What's also good is deep frying the skin in oil, like a potato chip. You can do this with some fins as well, and eat them even if they have spines because they become crunchy and edible. </p>
<p> I've just made a fish broth with heads and frames and realised after I'd oiled it that I forgot to take the guts out, I'm marginally worried it might make us sick?? It tastes fine, I didn't notice any bitterness, we haven't had our ramen yet, but the tastes I've had seem fine. </p>
<p> Hello! Great to read this and see comments! Keep on preventing food waste everyone! I have been making salmon/halibut/cod head soup for years. It is absolutely delicious and healthy. Next time i want to get the livers too and add that for more of the healthy fats. I get heads and backbones from friends or a local meat market. I keep a tub in my car specifically for fish scraps, (I loathe using plastic bags for this). When i can fish in jars for the pressure cooker, i have very little waste because i include all bones and skin. Some ppl waste so much when "cleaning" fish. </p>
<p> Yeah I'll eat anything, doesn't bother me. But as some people have pointed out, the sea is full of sketchy metals and plastics, so it might be worth checking out what's in your local waters (or the waters where the fish you eat are fished). Then again, maybe we should be eating these toxins til we evolve to deal with them, but high concentrations of them can cause pretty horrific effects such as paralysis, cancer, neurological damage etc, and it's entirely possible that we never do evolve a mechanism to offset these risks. In my opinion it's up to each individual (assuming a certain level of competency) to weigh these risks in making a decision on what to eat. </p>

<p> 6 Ways Eating Fish Can Help You Lose Weight, Say Dietitians </p>
<p> Baking salmon for dinner can seriously benefit your health goals. </p>
<p> Protein bars and protein shakes? Nah, eat a fillet of salmon! Fish is one of the healthiest foods you can add to your weekly meal plan. It's rich in all kinds of nutrients that benefit your body in multiple ways, including weight loss. Fish is an essential part of the Mediterranean Diet, which is considered the best diet for weight loss. So it's easy to conclude that eating fish is a huge part of this diet's success. </p>
<p> But how so? How does eating fish help you lose weight? We spoke with a few registered dietitians about how fish can help with your weight loss efforts, as well as other incredible benefits that eating it provides. Here's what they had to say—and for even more healthy eating tips, be sure to check out our list of The 7 Healthiest Foods to Eat Right Now. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Fish is a complete protein. </p>
<p> "Fish is a great source of complete protein, which is important to help you feel full when trying to lose weight," Jinan Banna, PhD, RD says. "This can help prevent overeating. A diet that is insufficient in protein may leave you feeling hungry. If your diet is made up mostly of simple carbohydrates, for example, you may not easily feel satisfied. So, rather than consuming a lot of potatoes, white rice, and other such foods as part of your meal, you will want to be sure to consume these moderately and include a serving of protein-containing foods such as fish." </p>
<p> Fish keeps you feeling full. </p>
<p> "Fish is a great source of high-quality protein. While protein does a lot of things in the body, from a digestion standpoint, it helps you get full faster and stay full longer," says Amy Goodson, MS, RD, CSSD, LD, author of The Sports Nutrition Playbook. "So, when you add a protein like fish to meals, you're more likely to stay satisfied longer. And if you choose a fatty fish like salmon, trout, or tuna that contains omega-3 fatty acids, you get a double benefit! Fats also contribute to satiety and omega-3s are heart-healthy fats, so it's a win-win!" </p>
<p> You significantly cut down on your fat intake. </p>
<p> "By opting to eat fish over high-fat animal products like beef or pork, you are significantly cutting down on the [number] of calories you're taking in at one meal," says Trista Best, MPH, RD, LD from Balance One Supplements. "Fish can also be prepared in tasty ways without adding excess fat and calorie-dense ingredients like cheeses and creams. Fish is also often paired with nutrient-dense vegetables like asparagus and squash, making the overall nutrient quality of your meals go up while the calorie density comes down." </p>
<p> Fish decreases inflammation. </p>
<p> Did you know that decreasing your body's inflammation not only helps you to live longer, but also it's linked to weight loss? One study published by the Archives of Medical Science points out that finding ways to "manage obesity" can help reduce the risk of diseases by decreasing inflammation. </p>
<p> "The omega fatty acids in fish will help to decrease the inflammation you are likely experiencing in your body," Best says. "As this inflammation decreases you'll see a change on the scale, but also in your energy. Low-grade, chronic inflammation is linked to mental and physical fatigue. Once your energy has improved you may be more apt to engage in physical activity, which can lead to weight loss." </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Fish is low in calories. </p>
<p> "Fish is a low-calorie, high protein choice that is perfect for a weight loss plan," Brenda Braslow, MS, RD with MyNetDiary says. "Per ounce, fish (uncooked) averages about 30 calories. It is one of the lowest-calorie protein foods when compared to other protein sources, such as lean beef at 56 calories per ounce, lean pork tenderloin at 33 calories per ounce, or kidney beans at 36 calories per ounce. Of course, you want to prepare fish without a lot of extra fat. Grilled, baked, boiled, or sushi is very low-calorie. Frying fish or adding rich sauces racks up the calories and won't help you lose weight." </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> Fish keeps your blood sugar stable. </p>
<p> "Protein-rich foods like fish also help keep your blood sugar steady," says Lisa Young, PhD, RDN, author of Finally Full, Finally Slim. "This will help you stay satisfied and keep your calories under control (without you actually having to count calories.) Fatty fish like salmon and tuna have an added boost, as they also contain heart-healthy omega 3 fats which are anti-inflammatory and good for your heart." </p>

<p> While selling the fruit is a great way to make a lot of Bells, fruit has another purpose in Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch: Eating fruit actually gives you a buff that helps you perform feats of strength that you wouldn’t be able to do otherwise. </p>
<p> While there’s only two main things you can do with your fruit-based power, they are essential tasks for those looking to rearrange their islands before they can start terraforming. </p>
<p> What happens when you eat fruit </p>
<p> When you have a piece of fruit in your inventory, select the option that lets you “Eat 1.” After your adorable eating animation, you’ll notice a little counter appear on the upper left of your screen. </p>
<p> Each piece of fruit will increase this counter by one, topping out at 10. But what do these numbers mean? Each of these numbers is a strength buff that will let you do one of two things with each use: </p>
<p> With the shovel, you can dig up an entire tree, regardless of its maturity. That means you can move any tree at will. </p>
<p> With the Shovel or Axe, you can destroy rocks completely. Be careful when doing this on your island — especially if you need them for farming Iron Nuggets — because it takes time for rocks to reappear. </p>
<p> Performing either of those actions will remove one number. When you’ve run out, you’ll need to eat more fruit to gain the strength again. </p>
<p> But you may be wondering how do you get rid of all the numbers at once? Well, there’s an easy way to do that: use a toilet. </p>

<doc id="file21599756" filename="eating-only-meat-and-eggs-did-this-to-my-cholesterol" parent_folder="web2" url="http://myzerocarblife.jamesdhogan.com/wp/2015/08/eating-only-meat-and-eggs-did-this-to-my-cholesterol/">
<p> Eating Only Meat and Eggs Did THIS to My Cholesterol </p>
<p> I kinda freaked out about getting my blood work done. </p>
<p> Contrary to what Fox News said at the conclusion of their segment about my zero carb diet, I actually hadn’t been to see my doctor in about eight years. That’s right: Eight years. The news commentators completely made that part up when they said that I’ve been under “close doctor supervision” for the past several years while eating a low/no carb diet. They also made up the part about me being the one to “invent this diet.” (I’m sure this is all a crushing blow to your faith in the media, right?) </p>
<p> Regardless, it’s not that I was avoiding my doctor, but I truly had no reason to go. I am generally quite healthy and (other than seeing my OB/Gyn) didn’t really have a need to see a physician. </p>
<p> So I called up Dr. Dunlap. This is the same doctor who originally told me to lose 100 pounds and put me on a very carb-restricted diet, which in turn led me to a zero carb diet nearly six years ago. He saw me as a patient after I lost all of that weight, but that was several years ago. In fact, I hadn’t been in so long that the office had archived my entire file and had to re-enroll me as a new patient, as I found out when I called Dr. Dunlap’s office a few months ago. I decided that I was due for a check-up and that perhaps it was time to have some blood work done. I made the appointment. </p>
<p> And then, I began to worry. </p>
<p> It’s one thing to believe in your head that eating a VERY high fat, all-meat diet is good for you. I know that it makes me feel energetic. I know that I followed this diet through two pregnancies and birthed two beautiful babies. I know that my weight went down and my quality of life improved. I’ve read a multitude of articles about animal fat not being bad for the heart, as long as there are no carbs in the diet. </p>
<p> I knew all of that. </p>
<p> But when it came down to getting my blood drawn, I started to have doubts. </p>
<p> I mean, how is it possible to eat burger patties, bacon, and half a cup of bacon grease per day and NOT have high cholesterol? (Especially when high cholesterol runs in my family. Mine was always on the high side, even as a young girl.) </p>
<p> I figured I ought to prepare myself for this. </p>
<p> Prior to my appointment, I started doing more reading and studying about which blood work numbers actually mean something anyway when it comes to predicting heart disease and health issues. As it turns out, your “total cholesterol” number seems to have only marginal value when it comes to making those predictions. People with high total cholesterol numbers aren’t any more likely to have a heart attack than those with low total cholesterol. It’s been researched and studied and proven. Seriously, Google it. </p>
<p> And if you’re wondering why so many people are on statin drugs to lower their cholesterol, if after all it is indeed a meaningless number, you should know that statins are a $29 B-B-B-BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. There is CRAZY money to be lost if people stop believing that cholesterol is bad for you. And, in case you haven’t noticed, business people don’t like to lose money. (Here’s a very helpful article about the great cholesterol myth: http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/02/01/29-billion-reasons-to-lie-about-cholesterol.aspx ) </p>
<p> In my research, I found article after article stating that I really need to know only a few things when it comes to my bloodwork, and none of them include the “total cholesterol” number. </p>
<p> 1) Blood sugar. Blood sugar numbers should remain steady throughout the day. Steady, level, not-high, not-low blood sugar numbers allow the body to lose weight and are a very good sign for overall health. Somewhere around 80-100 is where most people end up if they eat a diet that is free from carbs and sugars. </p>
<p> 2) The Triglyceride/HDL Ratio. THIS IS A BIG ONE. Your triglyceride number divided by your HDL number is the absolute greatest indicator of your risk for heart disease. Here is an article explaining why: http://www.docsopinion.com/2014/07/17/triglyceride-hdl-ratio/ If you want to focus on any one number when you have blood work done, make it this one. The goal is to get that ratio number as low as you possibly can. To do that, you want your triglycerides low and your HDL (deemed “good cholesterol”) to be high. A ratio of less than two is desirable. Anything above four is statistically a very bad sign that you may be at risk for heart disease. (For further reading: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2664115/) Now, knowing ALL of this, I felt prepared to have my bloodwork done. Or at least prepared to see the results. I requested for all my numbers to be available online and checked it about 700 times per day until they finally came in. Here’s what showed up: </p>
<p> OH, WOW! </p>
<p> I will fully admit that I took a HUGE sigh of relief when my “total cholesterol” was only 168, despite the fact that I think the number is meaningless. Why? Because it’s still what EVERYONE wants to know. How’s your cholesterol? I get asked constantly. Like, every day, everywhere I go. So, even if it doesn’t matter to me, I was happy to have a lovely little number to share. It makes people feel good about your health to see that nice, low number, so I was relieved to have one that the general public would find quite acceptable. </p>
<p> My fasting blood sugar was 77, which is about what my blood sugar is anytime I check it. Without eating carbs (AND I DON’T), my blood sugar never goes above 100. It’s around 80, no matter the time of day. Before a meal, after a meal, during a meal, 12 hours after a meal…doesn’t matter. It’s always about 80. Why? Because meat and eggs have almost NO impact on blood sugar numbers. I can eat as much high-fat meat as I want, and still have steady, even blood sugar. </p>
<p> My triglycerides came in at 60, which is terrific! The lower, the better, and 60 is great. </p>
<p> My HDL (“good cholesterol”) was 62, which is awesome! Eating high-fat foods and avoiding all carbs will give you lots of very healthy cholesterol, so that was no surprise. </p>
<p> Therefore, my tri/HDL ratio (the really important one, you recall!!) is only .9!!! POINT NINE!! Remember that anything under two is optimal. And anything over four is a strong indicator of future heart disease. So .9 is pretty freaking awesome! </p>
<p> My doctor was kind of speechless when he saw my numbers </p>
<p> My doctor looked at my numbers and asked me again to very specifically tell him what I eat each day. I slowly said, “I eat burgers, bacon, bacon grease, steak, and eggs. All day, every day. As much as I want. And nothing else.” </p>
<p> He checked my blood pressure. 100/60. </p>
<p> He gave me a full check-up, listening to my lungs and looking me over from head to toe. </p>
<p> He sat down silently and looked at my bloodwork numbers again. He asked me how I feel on a daily basis. I told him the truth: I feel fantastic, stay healthy, have lots of energy, and have no complaints at all. None. </p>
<p> He said, “It’s very unusual to see such a happy customer and to see blood work numbers like these. I would absolutely keep doing what you’re doing.” </p>
<p> KEEP DOING WHAT YOU’RE DOING. And that, friends, is exactly what I will do. </p>
<p> After nearly six years of eating a diet high in fatty protein but absent of carbs, I have never felt better. My doctor can’t find ONE THING wrong with me. Every single level (including calcium, sodium, protein, potassium, alkaline phosphates, EVERYTHING) was perfectly in a healthy range. </p>
<p> So, to answer the question that I hear on a nearly daily basis, “Yeah, but how’s your cholesterol?” I have to say, “Quite good, thank you!” </p>
<p> Rachel C </p>
<p> Thank you so much for taking the time and effort to get these tests done. Awesome results! </p>
<p> Alan </p>
<p> But…But…But, you can’t possibly be healthy eating this way. </p>
<p> Haha, I love shoving this in their faces.. </p>
<p> You keep doing what you’re doing. I’ll keep doing the same. Eventually the truth will out.. </p>
<p> Thanks.. </p>
<p> Tina </p>
<p> Do you ever eat carbs? Maybe on your birthday or going out to dinner….I can’t imagine 6 years without a carb….. </p>

<p> Glad your Doc was at least wise enough to not argue it, and tell you to keep on with what was actually working for you. </p>
<p> David walker </p>
<p> I have a similar numbers. Just a little higher blood sugar but still <100. (Probably because i drink red wine). Thanks for sharing your numbers. Keep it up! </p>

<p> Brandon </p>
<p> Great story and thank you for sharing. I was curious if you have heard of Dr. Joel Wallach? He has been preaching that cholesterol is so important for our bodies for decades. Was you test a cellular level blood test or just a regular blood test? According to Wallach just eating eggs, soft boiled, poached, or soft scrambled can lower your blood serum cholesterol levels. I eat 4 soft boiled eggs everyday and had a serum level blood test done thru my work and my cholesterol dropped considerably. A very large percentage of our brains are made of cholesterol. All of our arteries, veins, and cells are lined in cholesterol. Cholesterol helps to control your sex hormones. Sounds pretty important to me. It is really sad the media is so deceitful. We need more education like your story. Thank you very much for sharing and I wish you the best. </p>

<p> Do you eat any vegetables or is totally derived from animal products only? Have you had your vitamin levels checked too? </p>

<p> Hi such and inspiring story, I’m not the first to have read all your posts in one sitting. I am 7 weeks keto and have been trying hard to get 70-80% fat 15% Protein, 5% carbs. You clearly are not fussing over the macro, but I would be really interested to know what you think your FAT and or PROTEIN % is, ???? the reason I’m asking is so many other sites are saying not to have daily protein to high as that converts to sugar. thanks in advance from Australia if you get chance to answer. </p>
<p> Marie </p>
<p> I’ve been reading your entries & your FAQ, but I can’t find an answer to my most burning question yet: HOW did you afford to eat this way? </p>
<p> I am behind you on the science, and on the impact, as the only times I’ve lost weight was when I either ate extremely low carb (15 or less carbs a day) and/or did cardio/weight lifting 2+ hrs a day. I feel like you are telling the story of my life up in some ways…the weight you lost, the way you went nuts exercising (I would work out 2+ hrs a day & everyone but my husband thought I exaggerated), and the sugar cravings. </p>
<p> I have wanted to do the zero carb thing on/off for years, but have always let the cost stop me. I have a limited budget & can envision myself eating 2, maybe 3lbs of bacon in one sitting. I am almost frozen in fear that I will be eating $30/day to keep myself satiated. </p>
<p> What kind of $ did you spend when you first began on food? Has it changed? Is it less now that you eat mostly burgers? What about in the early days when you were still low carb, and then the early days of switching to zero carbs? </p>
<p> Your story is truly inspiring, btw. Truly. </p>
<p> Terry Wall </p>
<p> You will be surprised how little you spend on food. You aren’t buying all the other filler stuff, so we actually spend less! </p>
<p> Katherine </p>
<p> I know this is a very old post, but maybe someone will come across it soon. The money spent on carbs would be transferred to meats, and, in my case, I eat less through-out the day. A couple eggs and some bacon for breakfast and I’m still not really hungry come lunch. The desire to “munch” is gone too. The food budget for us hasn’t really changed. And on a side note, we very rarely eat out anymore, so there’s added savings. </p>
<p> Lady </p>
<p> I currently am on this diet and I agree with the others: it’s much cheaper! The protein fills me up so my body doesn’t need to munch all day long. I have no cravings, my energy levels are high, I can think clearly (without the fog), I don’t get migraines/tension headaches any more, AND I’m losing my excess weight. It’s GREAT! </p>
<p> Just like everyone above me said–I’m spending less money on junk, and only spending it on food I really need/like. I’ve measured what I eat and I only eat MAYBE 16 oz of meat a day. Before this diet, I was a portions girl: the bigger the portions the happier I was. But the protein in the meat cuts all of that so I barely eat anything now. I like eating organic, too, which means buying meats that are more pricey than other meats. But even then I spend less money than I do now! </p>
<p> Example: I have 4 eggs in the morning with 4 slices of Canadian Bacon. A carton of 12 organic (free range, brown) eggs costs me around $3.50 and lasts me 3 days. That’s about a $1.16 for eggs a day. The bacon is even cheaper–$2.50 (ish) for around 20 slices. That equals 0.13 cents per slice. So breakfast for me is around $1.68. </p>
<p> Now for lunch and dinner. Today I went to Walmart and bought a 16 oz packet of organic ground hamburger meat for $3.50. Don’t be fooled by it’s size! When you start you’re gonna look at that small packet of meat and think, “I’m going to starve!” You’re not. When I first started I could only have 12 oz of meat a day (4 breakfast, 4 lunch, 4 dinner). Trust me, you won’t get hungry. And if you do just eat 2 more ounces! Anyway, that little packet of meat can last me two meals, even three if I’m not super hungry. Today I decided to make it only for 2 meals. I fried it up at lunch, put taco seasoning in it, and split it in half. BOOM! Cheap meal! I only use half of a taco packet= 0.40 cents for these two meals. Split $3.50 in half and you’ve got $1.75. So for lunch AND dinner I’ve spent a whopping total of $2.15! Now imagine if I had split that into thirds (like I normally do): that would make three meals, each meal equaling only $1.31! </p>
<p> So for a total count for today: I’m full, energized, and only spent around $3.83. It’s FANTASTIC. </p>
<p> Now obviously I’m cool with eating hamburger meat today. But most days I like to have each meal be something different. So I may fix up some hamburger meat, and a chicken breast (I split the chicken breast up into individual ziplocks so I can have personalized portions). Then I may eat half of the hamburger meat for lunch and eat the chicken breast for dinner. I’ll take the rest of the hamburger meat and put it in the fridge until tomorrow. </p>
<p> You can eat all types of meat: chicken, fish, lamb, beef, seafood….You get a lot of options. The only person who limits the variety in which you eat is YOU. Cook the meat differently, use different spices, use different cheeses or dressings…it works–trust me! </p>

<p> Hi Kelly I totally recommend reading The Great Cholesterol Con by Malcolm Kendrick and his blog is great too. If you scroll through his blog posts you will find heaps of info on cholesterol, blood tests and Statins. Seriously anyone who has read his book would never even consider taking a Statin (I hope). Happy meat eating! Mel. </p>
<p> Mike </p>
<p> I just started the steak and eggs diet myself and I always have this fear in the back of my head if this is really going to kill me. I’m so glad to see othes having success with this diet as Vince Gironda did back in the 1950’s. I only eat twice a day and each meal consists of an 8oz steak and four eggs. My calorie intake is about 1800 which leaves me a pretty good deficit. I also work out 4 times a week at the gym for about 45 minutes lifting weights. I found this to be a great weightloss program. 3 lbs a week loss is a great start! Thank you for the informative article. Keep up the awesome work. </p>

<p> i can tell you from personal experience, in short (not long), that being on a meat only diet (I don’ t eat eggs) and drinking just water: meat and water, I have cured the side effects of many health issues that I had. I have mitochondrial disease and from that all sorts of things I dealt with for years, progressively got worse. I donate blood every 8 weeks, like clockwork, but I can tell you that by how i look and feel, all my mental and physical health issues went away from just eating meat and drinking water. I don’t do salt. I am sharing this to help others. Its very hard at times, but living healthy and being happy are the most important things in my life and many of your lives. You gotta do what you gotta do. </p>
<p> Taking a sick day from work today, lying I bed and just read ALL your posts in one go. Can’t wait to hit the fb page and faq. I have lost 17kgs since July 2015 on low carb and I am very interested to now look into this no carb idea… Went from 75kgs to 58kgs. For my height about 52kgs will give me the flat tummy bikini body. I am also hoping to cut the sugar cravings as the are still very real, especially since I cheated badly in our recent Easter break. Thank you very much for sharing your story </p>
<p> She Concepts </p>
<p> I am 5’7″ as of today I weigh 253 lbs and as of today I will commit to this no carb lifestyle. I am hoping that whoever reads this sends me some positive energy, blessings, good vibes and whatever else I may need to get the universe on my side. </p>

<p> Hello, Do you think I will get the same results from eating just poultry and seafood? I do not eat beef or pork. </p>
<p> Nita Hiltner </p>
<p> I just can’t imagine never eating salad again. Do you take vitamins and minerals that don’t come from meat and eggs? </p>
<p> jamesdhogan </p>
<p> Kel’s husband James here–no daily multivitamin for Kel. She did take a prenatal during pregnancy, however. It’s surprising how many vitamins you can get from meat, though! </p>

<p> I came across your blog and was inspired to start low carving and moving to Zero carving. I love my veggies. Today I cooked a turkey meatloaf wrapped in bacon! A first. It was good. Thank you for sharing! </p>

<p> Kel’s husband James here–not a stupid question at all. Kel has occasionally eaten dairy (really only cheeses and heavy cream for her coffee). Right now, though, she’s been off the dairy wagon for a while. </p>
<p> Hello, I am a 56 year old woman….I found I had diabetes 2 on the 10th March 2017. I was 144 kg..or 317 lbs in your speak. Today on 24 th March 2017 I am 139 kgs..or 306 lbs. I also have high blood pressure, asthma, a dicky knee. I have read all info on this weird wonderful sounding WOE, but to be honest, even though I can understand the logic behind it all, the high fat part terrifies me. I guess what I am basically asking is this….please please please be honest about this WOE claims, because I cannot afford to make my health worse. For the last 14 days, my blood sugar has come down a lot, ( but that maybe due to the meds ), and I have lost 5 kgs..11 lbs. I would gratefully appreciate a honest reply…Thank you..24/03/2017 </p>
<p> Barbara </p>
<p> Consider looking at the facebook page Reversing Diabetes & Low Carb Journey (Cooking with Kristie). It is important that you handle your blood glucose issues and learn how making this decision will affect you. I am basically in the same shaoe as you and these 2 groups have made a huge difference. We discuss budget concerns a lot because many people see that as a concern. Good Luck and be sure to post to me if you see me there! </p>
<p> TheManFromTaco </p>
<p> Yes. I had bloodwork down while I was on a moderate bulking routine with lots of heavy weight training and goodly amounts of meat and eggs every day, and my cholesterol levels were better than they ever had been in my life. </p>
<p> Research increasingly shows that wonky blood lipid levels are caused, not by high dietary fat and cholesterol intake, but by too much STARCH AND SUGAR! Down with carbohydrates! </p>

<p> Those numbers are almost unbelievable! Unbelievable but in a way believable… and that is why, at 57 years old, I am about to begin my zero carb journey! </p>
<p> Question … I hate meat. Is there anything I can substitute for the meat? I am newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and scared out of my mind. Also clueless. Saw the nutritionist who encourages me to eat the very thing that’s got me here, Carbs!! But that’s to keep taking the Metformin. Seems to me if I stop the carbs and eat protein and fat to keep my liver from dumping insulin I should be able to reverse this right? What can I eat instead of meat? Anyone? </p>
<p> Kimmy </p>
<p> SKP, there aren’t many options to substitute for meat except fish and eggs. Beans are high carb. Tofu is acceptable and has a reasonable carb count with 20 grams of protein in a cup. Clean low carb plant based protein powders (example Pumpkin) will increase your protein levels without too high carb count to keep your hunger at bay by including it in shakes. Be cautious with the fruit as many are high carb. Here’s a good site to get ideas http://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/low-carb-smoothies#intro1 Good luck! I just started LCHF on Saturday and I’m already down 4 pounds today! </p>

<p> Hey skip, check out subs on Reddit like VeganKeto (not that you need to be vegan) and look up low glycemic index vegetables. There’s some really good high fat veggies (well technically fruit) like Avocados. Coconut oil is also good in Medium Chain Fatty Acids, which are pro ketosis. It’s not nesscary to be in ketosis. But it’s a good search path for you if you don’t want to go the meat route but still have the benefits of a low carb, high fat diet. Not eating meat is pretty difficult to do IMO to be low carb. But it’s doable. </p>
<p> Ann </p>
<p> For SKP… Go to http://www.dietdoctor.com. LCHF (low carb, high fat). There are vegetarian options there, along with keto, paleo, etc. Get educated, be informed. Move forward. “I think I can, I think I can.” </p>

<p> Isn’t it awesome?! I got the same declaration from my doc. I was featured on Diet Doctor last year and am still working on losing about 15 more pounds. I have been low carb high fat for two years now. I am considering going zero carb. I think I’ll jump in and read more on your blog. </p>

<p> Hello and thanks to all previous posters 🙂 I’m in Australia and just turned 60 a few months ago. Haven’t been able to shed weight since menopause, about 8 years ago. Found the zero-carb plan and have dropped 24lbs since January, so I am DELIGHTED by the whole way of eating, as it’s rid me finally, of my life-long sugar/carb cravings. Only problem is that my GP is horrified by my cholesterol readings in a blood test recently; he says it’s twice a safe level – ?! I see other posters declaring their bloods are great/healthy, but mine isn’t and I’m at a loss about what to do 🙁 Any ideas? </p>
<p> L.D </p>
<p> Losing weight can cause cholesterol numbers to be high. Wait until you’re at a stable weight, then get retested. Make sure you fast before the test, don’t exercise before the test. Look up David Feldman. He shows how to drop your numbers for a test (kind of like cramming for school tests). </p>
<p> Your cholesterol changes every single day, sometimes by a lot. If you focus on Trig/HDL you can ignore the rest. AND you most likely know more about cholesterol than your doctor. My cardiologist was a one trick pony. Take a statin to lower your LDL. I took 3 cholesterol measurements over the course of 6 months. They were all different – by a lot. </p>
<p> But mostly DON’T WORRY. Stress is harmful for your heart. If you sleep well, eat well, pray/meditate and exercise you’ve done far more than any medicine can do for you. Look for Ivor Cummings. If you watch his cholesterol videos and still think you have a problem find a doctor who can help. </p>
<p> I’m 53, lost 52 lbs and feed great. I spent decades trying to exercise my way out of the pit modern food put me into. Carbs are not worth dying for. </p>

<p> Hi, I’m late, but there is nothing wrong with your cholesterol being high, not even your ldl cholesterol. What is important is the triglycerides and hdl. You want the triglycerides to be low and your hdl to be high with a good triglycerides/hdl ratio. That’s all that really matters. And if you are still worried, you could always do a CAC. Good luck! </p>
<p> Jimmie </p>
<p> Thanks for this! I just had a physical. (Like you, it’s been many years.) My doctor was concerned about my “high” cholesterol when the labs came back. But looking at this information, I can see I’m a-okay! My triglycerides to HDL ratio is only .58! </p>

<p> Can you live on meat and eggs alone a nourish a breastfeeding toddler (he is going on 4 years old but I have continued to nurse due to his extremely picky eating habits and I’m afraid he’ll starve if I quit or be malnourished. He has battled Candida overgrowth most of his life). Can I also take a prenatal (what kind do you recommend?), eat cilantro, garlic, onions and orange juice on the protein diet? Thank you for the inspiration 🙂 Blessings Do I have to eat organic meat and eggs (poor)? </p>
<p> Robert Atkinson-Knuckles </p>
<p> On a meat only diet, can you season meats with spices, would that defeat the purpose? </p>
<p> Stella </p>
<p> Hi Kelly, loved your YouTube interview. Real eye opener, been low carb for a while, makes me not so guilty when I don’t fancy veggies. I am in uk, and my husband loves meat. We recently got his bloods checked just for fun, and his creatinine levels were high and bun high too, I lowered his protein to under 90g a day and a month later his levels have dropped. I think this means his kidneys are fine. However, I wondered if you had your creatinine and bun checked, these tend to rise when having excess protein. Problem is the “normal” levels aren’t based on eating once a day or having low carb, all his other blood work apart from blood irate were spot on and blood pressure was awesome the doctor was surprised, I don’t think it made sense to him!! No surprise there. Thanks for the inspiration, Stella </p>
<p> Greg </p>
<p> I’m so happy for you. These are great numbers, and all without eating organ meats! 🤪 </p>
<p> Sam </p>
<p> This is very encouraging to read, as I am planning to start ZC very soon. The one marker I am curious about is IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1). A high IGF-1 number is a risk factor for some cancers. Have you had that tested? Everything I have read says that high protein consumption increases IGF-1, but I have yet to see anyone on ZC that has said how theirs has been affected. This is keeping me from starting right away, and I hope to find an answer soon. Thanks. 🙂 </p>
<p> Bill Leach </p>
<p> It has now been a great many years but… I had a general nuclear worker health exam and the doctor told me that he was concerned that my cholesterol was too high. He recommended that I cut out dairy, eggs and bacon (in particular). I was recently divorced, hard-headed, and was not about to give up foods that I liked but had indeed not been eating much of those foods and instead had been eating cereal for breakfast! </p>
<p> I switch, stopped eating cereal almost completely and ate almost exclusively eggs, bacon, and toast with copious amounts of butter (I never could stand margarine). When I went back for the followup, I was fully expecting to get another lecture on my cholesterol. I did not! My cholesterol was fine! </p>
<p> Of course I did not at the time realize that for the most part my diet was SAD and was ultimately destroying my health. </p>
<p> Kat Welch </p>
<p> Bill, I LOVE your story! I started dancing around and hooping and hollering LOL! I’m a retired nurse (and a Texan), I can appreciate when the patient “wins” against the SAD way of eating. </p>
<p> https://youtu.be/J7U8Qv_0Lrk I watched this video and found you to be absolutely charming. I was told I have type two diabetes 10 years ago. I was put on medications and finger sticks and a new found focus on my A1c. In fairness I was told to watch my diet but I was never told it was curable and reversible. I became an avid biker and hiker, lost a lot of weight but was still in the Over Weight BMI. My daughter told me I was missing the boat with all my emphasis on exercise and sent me The Diabetes Code. I started Keto and intermittent fasting a month ago, stopped taking medications to avoid potential hypoglycemia and I’ve lost 15 pounds which put me in the Normal BMI range. I started by reading the Obesity Code and The Diabetes Code Dr. Jason Fung which were recommended to me by my daughter, a CRNA, parent of two healthy boys (who don’t get candy) your age and a long time Peleo advocate. I’ve been watching every video on YouTube by several health professionals but I was happy to find yours based on your own experience. I am now looking forward to getting my next blood work done to see how the numbers stack up. Using myself as a lab rat I am anxious to find out if the theory of Keto with emphasis on Carnivore plays out favorably in the numbers that my doctor and my wife, a nurse specialist, will respect. I hope that these next few months of obsession with diet payoff and that I can simply cut out sugar (and medications) and continue living a happy healthy life. Many thanks again for taking the time to share your experiences with the public and all the best to you and your family. </p>

<p> After reading your article, I ran and got my last lab results and did the math: Trig/HDL. I have been on the ZC for 5 days. I’m excited for my next labs in four months! I’m 2.84 right now. I want to get it under 2. Thank you for educating me! </p>
<p> This is the part where I am not as good as you, after 1 year and a half carnivore, I would love a lower LDL, lower uric acid, higher iron, lower ferritine, lower MCV, higher MCHC, and higher total proteins! Here it goes… glucose 92 cholesterol 306 LDL 211 HDL 80 Triglyceride 76 So the ratio of HDL to triglycerides is thankfully good, but the ratio to LDL could be better! Uric acid 5,63 is already too high MCV 92,7 is over 90 so too high and showing B12 is low. MCHC 32,2 is at the lower limit, so too low. It tends to show iron deficiency. Total proteins 6,61 is at the lowest, so too low. Seric iron 55,2 is normal but on the low side, Ferritin 121,6 is normal but on the high side, comparing the 2 means I store iron, which is also shown in my high hair iron (which motivated the blood test) Ok, I am still dumping oxalate and you did not seem to have had the issue. And I never had any weight issues and never was high carb, so my metabolism is not the same as yours. </p>
<p> Jeffrey A Murphy </p>
<p> Do you know of anyone who’s done this diet after having a thyroidectomy? I’m almost 6 yrs post op,, and while I’m “ok”,, I would love to get closer to being more of my old self. </p>

<p> In the earlier days on Minecraft, the hunger mechanic was not implemented. However, developers began to think of adding a challenge to the Survival Mode, and thus, they added the hunger mechanic. In short, a player in Survival Mode or Hardcore Mode must eat food to restore their hunger bars. If the amount of hunger bars is too low, the player cannot sprint, and if the hunger bars are completely depleted, the player will begin losing health. No food means death, so you must learn how to eat in Minecraft. </p>
<p> Kill animals for meat. Many animals you find in your Minecraft world will drop meat when killed. All of this meat is safe to eat raw, except chicken meat, which can give you food poisoning. Cooking meat will increase its benefits. </p>
<p> You can get meat from cows, pigs, chickens, mooshrooms, sheep, and rabbits. </p>
<p> Fish for food. If you have a fishing rod, you can fish for food. Raw fish, raw salmon, and clownfish are safe to eat, but pufferfish will cause food poisoning and nausea. Cooking raw fish will increase its benefits. </p>
<p> Harvest crops. Various crops and plants will drop food when harvested. Some crops, such as carrots, potatoes, and melons you can eat immediately. Others, such as wheat, sugar cane, pumpkins and cocoa beans you will need to craft to make food. You can farm wheat, potatoes, carrots, beetroots, apples (by planting trees), pumpkins, and melons. You'll find these plants in various locations throughout your world, though you may be able to find a lot concentrated in village farms. </p>
<p> Play in Survival mode. Your Hunger bar does not deplete in Creative mode or Peaceful mode. </p>
<p> Check your Hunger bar. You can only eat when the Hunger bar is not completely full. The only exceptions to this are chorus fruit, golden apples, and milk. </p>
<p> Your Hunger bar will shake when it begins to lower. Once at least one of your hunger icons starts to deplete, you can eat. </p>
<p> Select the food item you want to eat. Open your inventory and drag the food item onto your hotbar at the bottom of the screen. Press the hotbar number to select the food and hold it in your hand. </p>
<p> Press and hold the "Use Item" button. This is usually the right mouse button but can be changed to other keys. Continue holding the button until the food has been completely eaten. </p>
<p> Play Survival mode. The Hunger bar does not go down in Creative mode or Peaceful mode, so you won't be able to eat if you're playing either of these. </p>
<p> Check your Hunger bar. You'll only be able to eat if you Hunger bar is not completely full. The only exceptions to this are golden apples and milk. </p>
<p> If your Hunger bar is shaking, it will begin lowering. You'll be able to eat once at least the first hunger icon begins to get used up. </p>
<p> Select the food you want to eat. If you pick up food without anything in your hands, it will be selected automatically. You can tap the "..." button to open your inventory, tap a hotbar box, then tap your food item to add it to your hotbar. You can then tap it in your hotbar to hold it. </p>
<p> Press and hold your screen with your food selected. You may have to look around a little bit before you are able to start eating, as you may accidentally be trying to click a block. Press and hold your screen until the food has been eaten.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> Get to know how the Hunger bar works. Although you only see the Hunger bar in the game, there are actually two hunger systems at work: Hunger and Saturation. The Saturation level is hidden from the player but affects how the Hunger bar depletes. The hidden Saturation level needs to completely deplete before your Hunger bar starts to drop. Certain foods give higher Saturation bonuses, allowing you to go longer without having to eat.[2] X Research source </p>
<p> Your Saturation level drops as you perform strenuous activities like sprinting. The Hunger bar will begin to jiggle when your Saturation level has been completely depleted. </p>
<p> Eat high-Saturation, low-Hunger foods when your bar is almost full. This will give you the largest Saturation bonus, and allow you to go the longest without having to eat again. </p>
<p> High-Saturation foods include cooked pork chops, steak, cooked mutton, cooked salmon, golden carrots, and golden apples. </p>
<p> Cook your meats to make them more effective. You can eat any of the raw meat and gain a small amount of food points, but you'll get better results if you cook the meat first. In order to cook meat, you'll need a furnace. You can create a furnace by placing 8 cobblestone blocks around the edge of your crafting grid. </p>
<p> Once you have a furnace, place some fuel in the bottom box and your raw meat in the top. The meat will be cooked and will give you about 3 times the original Hunger benefit and about 5 times the original Saturation benefit when eaten. </p>
<p> Cooking chicken is the only way to safely eat it. If you eat raw chicken, you have a 30% chance of getting food poisoning. </p>
<p> Putting a potato in a furnace will create a baked potato, which has better hunger benefits. </p>
<p> Craft food items from ingredients. There are a variety of food items that can be created by combining ingredients. These can provide good Hunger recovery, but don't offer as much Saturation. Eat these when your Hunger meter is low to get the best effect: </p>
<p> Pumpkin pie - Crafted from an egg, a sugar, and a pumpkin. </p>
<p> Rabbit stew - Crafted from a cooked rabbit, a carrot, a baked potato, a mushroom, and a bowl. </p>
<p> Golden carrot - Crafted from a carrot and 8 gold nuggets. </p>
<p> Golden apple - Crafted from an apple and 8 gold nuggets. </p>
<p> Avoid food poisoning. There are several foods that have a chance to get you sick if you eat them, or don't prepare them properly. When you get food poisoning, you lose 0.5 Hunger units per second for 30 seconds. Drink milk to counteract the effects of food poisoning.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> Raw chicken has a 30% chance of giving you food poisoning. Cook chicken to avoid this. </p>
<p> Rotten flesh has an 80% chance of giving you food poisoning. There is no way to make it safer. </p>
<p> Pufferfish has a 100% chance of giving you advanced food poisoning, which will take 1.5 Hunger units per second for 15 seconds. It will also give you Poison IV, which will drop your player health. You cannot cook pufferfish. </p>
<p> Spider eyes have a 100% chance to give you Poison, which will drop your player health by two full hearts. </p>

<p> Community Q&A </p>
<p> Surround a large area with fence (don't forget a gate!), then find a minimum of two cows and trap them in the fenced area using wheat (grown or found in a village). When you've got that done, right click the cows with the wheat in hand. This will make a baby cow. It may take the cow 10 minutes or so to grow up. </p>
<p> Things you'll need: a cow, an iron bucket. Select the iron bucket. Approach the cow. Right-click (or press the 'Use Item' button if playing on some other platform) on the cow while holding the iron bucket. </p>
<p> It doesn't show a feed button, how do I feed myself? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Hold the food in your hand. Press whatever button is assigned to placing blocks, and your character will eat the food. </p>
<p> Place the cake, then look at it and press the use button. Each time you do, you eat one slice. </p>
<p> You could try and find a village nearby, or just run around until you find some animals. </p>
<p> To eat in Pocket Edition of Minecraft, just hold down on the screen until you eat the food. </p>
<p> Check that you're in survival mode. Then check which button you've set for eating (by default, it's holding down your right-click). For PE, check that you're not trying to break a block before holding your finger against the screen. </p>
<p> Tips </p>
<p> If you have a cake to eat, it needs to be put on a surface before it can be eaten (You can eat from it 7 times). </p>
<p> Milk (made by right-clicking a cow with a bucket) will clear status effects on the player. Milk is also used to make a cake. </p>
<p> Warnings </p>
<p> However, wolves can be encouraged to breed by feeding them rotten flesh, so it's not all bad! </p>
<p> Rotten flesh, spider eyes, raw chicken and poisonous potatoes have a percentage of you getting poisoned if you eat them. Try to avoid these! </p>

<p> For Catholics, Lent is the holiest time of the year. Still, many people wonder why those who practice that faith can't eat meat on Good Friday, the day on which Jesus Christ was crucified. That's because Good Friday is a day of holy obligation, one of 10 days during the year (six in the U.S.) that Catholics are required to abstain from work and instead attend mass. </p>
<p> Days of Abstinence </p>
<p> Under the current rules for fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church, Good Friday is a day of abstinence from all meat and foods made with meat for all Catholics age 14 and over. It is also a day of strict fasting, in which Catholics between the ages of 18 and 59 are permitted only one full meal and two small snacks that don't add up to to a full meal. (Those who cannot fast or abstain for health reasons are automatically dispensed from the obligation to do so.) </p>
<p> It is important to understand that abstinence, in Catholic practice, is (like fasting) always the avoidance of something that is good in favor of something that is better. In other words, there is nothing inherently wrong with meat, or with foods made with meat; abstinence is different from vegetarianism or veganism, where meat might be avoided for health reasons or out of a moral objection to the killing and eating of animals. </p>
<p> The Reason for Abstaining </p>
<p> If there is nothing inherently wrong with eating meat, then why does the Church bind Catholics, under pain of mortal sin, not to do so on Good Friday? The answer lies in the greater good that Catholics honor with their sacrifice. Abstinence from meat on Good Friday, Ash Wednesday, and all the Fridays of Lent is a form of penance in honor of the sacrifice that Christ made for our sake on the Cross. (The same is true of the requirement to abstain from meat on every other Friday of the year unless some other form of penance is substituted.) That minor sacrifice—abstaining from meat—is a way of uniting Catholics to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, when He died to take away our sins. </p>
<p> Is There a Substitute for Abstinence? </p>
<p> While, in the United States and many other countries, the bishops' conference allows Catholics to substitute a different form of penance for their normal Friday abstinence throughout the rest of the year, the requirement to abstain from meat on Good Friday, Ash Wednesday, and the other Fridays of Lent cannot be replaced with another form of penance. During these days, Catholics can instead follow any number of meatless recipes available in books and online. </p>
<p> What Happens If a Catholic Eats Meat? </p>
<p> If a Catholic slips and eats meant because they truly forgot that it was Good Friday, their culpability is lessened. Still, because the requirement to abstain from meat on Good Friday is binding under pain of mortal sin, they should make sure to mention eating meat on Good Friday at their next confession. Catholics who wish to remain as faithful as possible should regularly brush up on their obligations during Lent and other holy days of the year. </p>

<p> Some people eat to live, and some people live to eat. Whether you want to eat more for enjoyment, competition, or to build muscle, you need to learn to do it safely to maintain good health. Building the capacity of your stomach is like working out any muscle, and it requires some planning and smarts to do it right. </p>
<p> Always eat breakfast. It's a common misconception that you need to keep your stomach empty if you want to eat more, and in fact this can't be further from the truth. Starting your day with fruits, whole grains, or lean protein is an excellent way to kick your metabolism into gear, meaning you'll be hungrier later in the day, meaning you'll be ready to eat more later in the day.[1] X Expert Source Tara Coleman Clinical Nutritionist Expert Interview. 22 October 2020. </p>
<p> A recent study found that the morbidly obese are more likely to skip meals earlier in the day.[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Don't ever starve yourself. </p>
<p> Eat standing up. Competitive eaters eat standing up for a reason. When you eat sitting down, pressure is put on your stomach by your other organs, and it won't expand as much as when you're standing. It's also uncomfortable. The stomach can hold quite a bit of food when you stretch your torso out to it's longest, which happens in the standing position. </p>
<p> Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes. Those sweatpants you get out on holidays? Smart move. Wearing comfortable clothes is an essential part of eating more and remaining comfortable while you do it. Your stomach does, in fact, expand as you eat, and tight shirts and slacks restrict its ability to do some comfortably. If you want to eat more, wear the clothes that will allow it. </p>
<p> Eat foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). Monosodium glutamate is a naturally-occurring compound that's artificially added to many foods to give it flavor. One side effect of MSG is that it stimulates insulin response, effectively lowering your blood-sugar levels and making your body think that it needs to eat more to bring those levels back up. </p>
<p> MSG is found in lots of packaged and prepared foods, like ramen noodles, potato and tortilla chips, canned vegetables and soups, and processed meats. </p>
<p> MSG is a controversial ingredient, often derided for its connection to obesity and linked by some people to health effects as diverse as chest pains and facial numbness.[3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While studies report that there's no actual connection between the additive and these symptoms, it's still a controversial substance. </p>
<p> Drink a moderate amount of alcohol or soda with meals. Aside from the fact that sugary sodas and alcoholic beverages complement meals quite well, the sugars in sodas and boozes of all sorts cause insulin spikes that trick your body into thinking that you want to eat more food. </p>
<p> Commercial sodas contain lots of refined sugar, and the body needs to produce more insulin to process refined white sugars, resulting in a similar insulin response to that of MSG. Your body will think you need to eat more food. Diet soda, which contains aspartame, likewise results in a similar effect. </p>
<p> Aside from the inhibition-lowering effects of alcohol, which can cause you to eat calorie-rich foods you may normally avoid, the sugars in alcohol can have a similar effect, lowering serotonin levels and increasing your insulin response, causing hunger. </p>
<p> Carbonated beverages are filling, which means that if you drink a lot of beer or soda with a meal, you'll get more full faster, leaving less room for food. Aim for about half a soda, to get the same insulin spike, without the filling effect. </p>
<p> Avoid mustard. If you're trying to eat a lot of food, it's important to avoid consuming certain condiments, the contents of which can irritate your stomach and esophagus, making it more difficult to eat a larger quantity of food. Mustard is made of ground mustard seed, a potent member of the brassica family, and vinegar, both of which will slow your hunger and metabolism. </p>
<p> It's also good to avoid any other vinegar-based, spicy condiments, like bbq sauce, hot sauce, Sriracha, and other peppery dips or toppings. </p>

<p> Method 1 Quiz </p>
<p> What should you eat for breakfast if you are trying to eat more food throughout the day? </p>
<p> Don't eat breakfast so you'll be hungrier later. </p>
<p> Try again! Although it might seem like eating less earlier will help you eat more later, this isn't actually the case. Starting your day with a good breakfast will actually jump-start your metabolism and make it easier for you to eat more later. Choose another answer! </p>
<p> Food with MSG. </p>
<p> Not quite! Although MSG might help you eat more, you don't need to start your day this way. There are other foods you can eat early in the day to get your metabolism going that don't have the possible negative effects that MSG might have on your body. Guess again! </p>
<p> Lean proteins. </p>
<p> Exactly! Lean proteins, fruits, and whole grains will all jump-start your metabolism and help enable you to eat more later in the day. Whether you're trying to eat more or lose weight, never skip breakfast. Read on for another quiz question. </p>
<p> Spicy foods. </p>
<p> Nope! If you're trying to eat more food, avoid spicy foods throughout the day. Spicy food and condiments can irritate your stomach and esophagus, making it more difficult to eat more food. Try again... </p>
<p> Calculate your body-mass index (BMI) first. If you're trying to bulk up because you're too lean, or you're trying to gain muscle, it's important to make sure your body is ready for gaining weight in the healthiest possible way. Just because you "look skinny" doesn't mean you have a BMI that's optimal for weight gain, and you might be doing yourself an unhealthy disservice by trying to gain before you get into shape. While it's best to visit a nutritionist first, you can measure your BMI yourself with the following calculation:: </p>
<p> Your weight in kg (or weight in pounds divided by about 2.2), divided by </p>
<p> Your height in meters squared </p>
<p> If your BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, you're at a low-normal body weight, which means you can safely gain weight, with the proper nutrition and guidance.[4] X Research source </p>
<p> Calculate the necessary caloric intake for building muscle. Muscle can only be built when you create a calorie surplus, then work out in targeted ways to promote muscle growth in your body. The difference between gaining muscle and gaining fat requires that you calculate how many calories you'll need to eat to gain muscle effectively, and making sure you eat the right kinds of foods. To calculate the amount of calories you'll need: </p>
<p> Multiply your bodyweight in pounds by 20. This is the amount of calories you'll need to eat on days that you work out, to gain muscle. </p>
<p> Calculate your protein needs. If you want to build muscle and gain weight, it's absolutely essential that you take in enough protein to promote muscle growth.[5] X Expert Source Tara Coleman Clinical Nutritionist Expert Interview. 22 October 2020. Without the proper amount of protein, you can do damage to your muscles by over-exerting them. To find out how much lean protein you'll need, multiply your bodyweight in pounds by about 1.5 to find out the number of grams of protein you'll need to consume in a day. </p>
<p> Make friends with chicken and peanut butter. Lean in fat, but high in protein, these are easy-to-eat and widely available ways of making sure that you get enough protein in your diet. </p>
<p> Drink whey protein shakes between meals. An extremely common way of bulking up and gaining muscle mass after workouts is to use a protein supplement to stimulate muscle growth. Protein whey powders are widely available, which allow you to mix up smoothies to get added nutrients, vitamins, and added protein into one easy-to-drink concoction. </p>
<p> Protein shakes are notoriously not very tasty, so it's helpful to incorporate whey powder into smoothies including yoghurt, bananas, strawberries, and other tasty fruits, so you're not just slugging down what amounts to protein wallpaper paste. If it tastes better, you'll be much more likely to use it. </p>
<p> Eat low-glycemic slow-digesting carbohydrates. You should be eating about twice your weight (lbs.) in carbohydrates (grams) on days that you work out, and those carbs should consist primarily of low-glycemic carbohydrates. That means whole grains, like rolled oats, and fresh fruits, and sweet potatoes. Avoid refined wheat flour.[6] X Research source </p>
<p> Stimulate testosterone production by eating fat. Athletes who build muscle typically eat more monosaturated and saturated fats, which increase testosterone levels, in turn helping muscle growth. You should typically be eating about half your body weight (pounds) in good fats during your work out days. </p>
<p> One of the best ways to do this is drinking milk. It's easy to take down, even if you're not feeling hungry, and an excellent way to get more fat into your diet. Drink a glass of milk three times a day when you work out. </p>
<p> Develop your lifting or training regimen. All this calorie intake will just translate into fat unless you're lifting and workout out vigorously along with your calorie surplus. Make sure you develop a healthy work-out routine tailored to your interests and goals for muscle gain. </p>
<p> Typically, on days that you'll work out, you'll add a hefty pre- and post-workout meal to your regular three-meal-a-day regimen. To eat the proper number of calories on your off-days, simply skip these meals. </p>
<p> Take a fiber supplement. If you're going to be increasing the amount of lean protein and carbs that you eat in a day, it's also very important that you take a fiber supplement to keep your gastro-intestinal tract functioning regularly. Gaining weight effectively can be somewhat uncomfortable without one. </p>

<p> Method 2 Quiz </p>
<p> What do you need to do in order to build muscle? </p>
<p> Close! Building muscle does require you to eat a lot of protein, but this isn't all you should do to build muscle. Multiply your body weight in pounds by 1.5: that is the number of grams of protein you should be eating each day to build muscle. Click on another answer to find the right one... </p>
<p> Work out a lot. </p>
<p> Almost! To build muscle, you'll have to do a lot of targeted workouts, but this alone won't build muscle. Do repeated, targeted workouts on the areas you want to build muscle. There’s a better option out there! </p>
<p> Eat specific types of carbohydrates. </p>
<p> Close! When you're trying to build muscle, your diet should consist of a lot of low-glycemic high-digesting carbohydrates (double your body weight in pounds to find out how many grams of carbs you should be eating). This isn't the only dietary addition you should make to build muscle, though. Click on another answer to find the right one... </p>
<p> Eat the right amount of calories. </p>
<p> You're not wrong, but there's a better answer! Before you start working out or eating a lot of protein, calculate the amount you should be eating each day. You'll have to have a caloric surplus to build muscle, but this isn't the only important part of muscle-building. Try again... </p>
<p> All of the above. </p>
<p> Exactly! All of the previous answers are good ways to build muscle. Make sure you calculate the number of calories you need to consume each day and target your workouts so those calories convert to muscle instead of fat in addition to eating the right types of foods. Read on for another quiz question. </p>
<p> Build up your stomach capacity slowly. Anyone who's ever been inspired to down as many franks as possible by the Nathan's Hot Dog competition has come up against a quick and harsh reality: you can't eat that many hot dogs without preparation. The stomach is a muscle like any other. It needs training and recovery, otherwise you risk injury. If you want to increase your stomach's capacity, take it slow. </p>
<p> According to some studies, the average human stomach holds about 1.5 liters before becoming nauseated, but can hold between 3-5 liters if trained properly. </p>
<p> It is possible to rupture your stomach if you eat too much too quickly, but it's extremely uncommon and rare. You'll usually vomit before you risk a stomach tear or other physical problems. </p>
<p> Train with water. The healthiest way of training and expanding your stomach capacity is not with food, but with water. Competitive eaters are able to drink as much as a gallon of water at a time, in less than 20 minutes. This increases the stomach's capacity and carries relatively little health impact, compared with eating lots of food at once. </p>
<p> Start slow, increasing the number of glasses of water you drink in a day incrementally, then increasing the speed at which you consume the water you drink. It's usually recommended to drink as many as eight glasses of water in a day to begin with, so start there and gradually build up your capacity. </p>
<p> Wet your food. Water serves a purpose during eating competitions, as well as during your training. While dunking a hot dog bun in water might not seem that appetizing, it helps to break down the food before you put it into your mouth, making it much easier to swallow and start digesting. The faster you get it down, the more you'll be able to eat, and water helps this process. </p>
<p> Don't drink too much of the water while you're eating. While it's ok to use some water to help lubricate the food, don't gulp it to quench your thirst, or you'll be taking up valuable real estate in your stomach. </p>
<p> Train with cruciferous vegetables. Two or three times a week, competitive eater Yasir Salem steams as many as eight pounds of broccoli and cauliflower for a training meal. These vegetables are bland, high in vitamins, and will move through your digestive tract quickly, making them ideal for stretching your stomach easily, combined with a large amount of water.[7] X Research source </p>
<p> For an added bonus, add a large amount of sauerkraut. Fermented cabbage has probiotic properties that will help keep your intestinal flora in balance, making it an ideal food for competitive eaters. </p>
<p> Chew gum to strengthen your jaw muscles. Competitive eaters will regularly chew up to six pieces of gum at once, to strengthen jaw muscles and make sure their eating instrument is in good working order. As important as your stomach is to your ability to eat more food, it won't do any good if you can't chew that food quickly and efficiently. </p>
<p> Check out this wikiHow article for neck and jaw strengthening exercises you can incorporate into your routine. </p>
<p> Do lots of cardiovascular exercise. Ever notice how competitive eaters are generally lean and mean? That's because they're in shape. Contrary to what you might expect, the ability to eat a lot comes from a lot more than a big appetite. Hard training and good cardio are an essential part of being able to eat food quickly and competitively. </p>
<p> Good breathing is necessary for competitive eaters, as well. Do breathing exercises to make sure you can breathe effectively while you're cramming that food in. </p>
<p> Specialize. Not all competitive eaters are alike. Hot dog champions need to train in completely different ways, for completely different amounts, than does a bacon-eating champion, a chili eating champion, or an oyster eating champion. Knowing the specifics of your food of choice will allow you to prepare more specifically. </p>
<p> Major League Eating is the US national organization that governs competitive eating. Check out their website to learn more about joining up and competing.[8] X Research source </p>
<p> It's very important to meet with a health professional, dietician, or biofeedback specialist to come up with a health and training regimen for the food you hope to consume to keep your body working for you, instead of against you. </p>

<p> Method 3 Quiz </p>
<p> Why is drinking a lot of water the best way to train your stomach to eat a lot of food at once? </p>
<p> Because drinking a lot of water at once has relatively few health risks. </p>
<p> Right! Training your stomach for competitive eating with water is the safest option. While competitive eating isn't dangerous if you do it right, training with water is a safer way to stretch your stomach than starting with food right away. Read on for another quiz question. </p>
<p> Because you should drink a lot of water in a day anyway. </p>
<p> Not quite! You should drink around 8 glasses of water per day, but to stretch your stomach in preparation for an eating contest, you'll need to drink a lot more. Competitive eaters can drink up to a gallon of water in 20 minutes! Try again... </p>
<p> Because you'll need to drink a lot of water during your eating competition. </p>
<p> Nope! When you're in an eating contest, try not to drink water at all. You can use it to lubricate the food, but water will just take up space in your stomach. Click on another answer to find the right one... </p>
<p> Because water will move through your body quickly, allowing you to drink even more. </p>
<p> Not exactly! While water won't stay in your body for very long, that's not the reason it's a good idea to train with water instead of food. The point of training with water is to stretch your stomach because, during an eating contest, you'll need to eat as much as you can at one time. There’s a better option out there! </p>
<p> Community Q&A </p>
<p> What should I do if my stomach tries to reject food whenever I eat? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> You should go to your doctor and have them run some tests to determine the cause of your stomach problems. You might have acid reflux, for example, which is treatable with daily medication. </p>
<p> Try to distract yourself when eating, by watching something or sitting with other people. If you inform those closest to you of your wish to eat more, they will probably be supportive. Remember why you are doing this, even though it's hard. </p>
<p> I usually don't feel hungry at all. Even when I try to eat, I don't have the apetitte to eat and I get filled quickly. I want to be able to eat more, what can I do? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Try to drink less water or liquid before eating so that you do not fill yourself up with that before a meal. Also, you can slowly increase your meal size so that you can gradually eat more. Do not try and eat a lot more all at once. If you feel you have an issue with your appetite, you can consult with your doctor. </p>
<p> If you're trying to gain weight, drink protein shakes. But if your goal is simply to eat more food, you should do the opposite; drink low calorie drinks like water, juice, Gatorade, etc., as these will not fill you up. </p>
<p> You can, but being "fat" is unhealthy. If you are underweight, you can certainly eat more food to gain weight, but you should stick with healthy foods like protein, vegetables, some carbs, grains, etc. </p>
<p> How do I not eat as much if I'm getting hungrier as I get older? </p>
<p> Dedelover </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Getting hungrier throughout is completely normal and something you shouldn't be afraid of. As your body grows, you need more energy to keep you running efficiently. So, don't fight it and still eat a healthy amount and just make sure it isn't more than your body can handle. </p>

<p> There’s so much information available about how to eat properly and it can be overwhelming! While you may have heard all kinds of things about what foods to eat and what ones to avoid, there are some simple rules that can help you to make the right food choices. Start by making sure your diet includes healthy foods and beverages. Then, work on adjusting your eating habits, such as by cooking for yourself, reading labels, and making healthy swaps. You may also benefit from adjusting the timing of your meals and snacks. </p>
<p> Swap unhealthy foods for healthier versions. Making simple swaps can help to improve your eating habits in an easy, painless way. Identify something unhealthy that you enjoy and then look for an alternative that would be healthier and satisfy the same craving. This may simply be a lower fat version of an item, or a different food that satisfies the same craving.[1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source </p>
<p> For example, if you’re a fan of chips and dip, you might try swapping your potato chips for carrot chips or baked potato chips and you could swap a high-fat dip for fresh-made guacamole or a lower-fat yogurt-based dip. </p>
<p> Get into the habit of reading labels. Checking labels will help you to avoid items that contain unhealthy ingredients, such as added sugar and trans fats. Look at the nutrition information on any packaged foods and if it’s high in fat, sugar, sodium, or all three, don’t eat it![2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source </p>
<p> Some foods will indicate on the front of the package if they’re low in fat, free from added sugars or trans fats, or low-sodium. However, it’s still important to check the nutrition information to make sure the food is actually healthy. </p>
<p> Read the ingredients on the label, too! If you’re trying to avoid a specific ingredient, such as sugar, oil, or wheat, you can easily figure out if a food is something you want to avoid by checking the ingredients. </p>
<p> Measure your food to ensure that you’re eating reasonable portions. Packaged foods will include information on the serving size. To ensure that you’re consuming the amount of calories and fat indicated per serving, you’ll need to measure out the amount indicated on the package. You might need a scale or measuring cups depending on the type of food.[3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source </p>
<p> For example, if you prepare a box of macaroni and cheese, the serving size might be 1 cup (240 g) of cooked macaroni and cheese. Use a measuring cup to dole out exactly this amount. </p>
<p> Portion sizes are much bigger than they used to be, so read labels on any prepackaged foods you buy and avoid overly large portions.[4] X Trustworthy Source Dairy Council of California Resource center focused on providing nutrition education to help consumers make healthy choices about eating and lifestyle habits. Go to source </p>
<p> Keep unhealthy items out of your environment. To eliminate the temptation of junk foods and other unhealthy items, don’t buy them! Keeping these items out of your environment will help to ensure that you won’t be tempted. You may even want to go through your cupboards and refrigerator to weed out unhealthy foods.[5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source </p>
<p> If you share a home with other people, talk to them about setting up a cupboard or shelf in your pantry and a drawer or shelf in your fridge that is for healthy foods only. This will be your safe zone for choosing what to eat. </p>
<p> Tip: Shop for your food along the outer aisles of the grocery store. The perimeter of the grocery store is usually where you will find the healthiest items, such as fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, and dairy products.

<p> Use mindful eating strategies to eat less and enjoy your food more. Practicing mindful eating habits may help you to eat less by slowing you down. It’s also a great way to enjoy your food more. Always sit down at a table to eat your meals and try to pace yourself so that it takes you around 20 minutes to eat. Some other strategies you might try include:[7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source </p>
<p> Eliminate distractions during your meals, such as by turning off the television and putting away your phone </p>
<p> Notice the look and smell of your food before you start eating </p>
<p> Hold your fork or spoon in your non-dominant hand or try eating with chopsticks </p>
<p> Work with a therapist to control emotional eating. If you turn to food for comfort when you’re feeling sad, lonely, or bored, you might be engaging in emotional eating. This can result in eating when you’re not hungry, eating foods that aren’t healthy for you, and overeating. Learning coping strategies to deal with your emotions without food will help you to eat healthier. Find a therapist who has experience helping people with emotional eating habits and make an appointment.[8] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source </p>
<p> For example, a therapist can teach you how to identify what you’re feeling and then figure out something healthy you could do to feel better, such as taking a walk, doing a deep breathing exercise, or listening to music. </p>
<p> Make sure to ask your doctor for a referral to a therapist. This is sometimes required for insurance to cover the appointments. </p>
<p> Fill your plate half-full of vegetables and fruits at each meal. Fruits and vegetables are loaded with nutrients and fiber, and they’re lower in calories than most other foods; especially if they're organic (pesticide-free). Fill up half of your plate with 1 to 2 servings of vegetables or fruits at each meal. This will help you to fill up faster and stay full longer.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> You can steam, stir-fry, roast, or boil your vegetables. Prepare them however you like! </p>
<p> Try having a side salad or raw vegetable slices with your meal if you don’t want to cook vegetables. </p>
<p> If you’re in a hurry, opt for a fresh whole fruit that you can eat on the go, such as an apple or banana, or grab a container of cooked fruit. </p>
<p> Include whole grains and limit refined carbohydrates. Whole-grain versions of carbohydrate-dense foods are healthier for you because they contain more fiber and nutrients. They also help to keep you full and sustain your energy levels for longer. Opt for whole wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, and brown rice, instead of white versions of these foods. Some other healthy whole grains you might include are:[10] X Research source </p>
<p> Add a serving of lean protein to your plate at each meal. Protein should make up about 1/4 of your plate at each meal. Protein-rich foods include meat, fish, beans, and eggs. Some dairy products are also high in protein, such as cottage cheese and Greek yogurt. Opt for lean proteins, such as skinless chicken breast, tilapia, ground turkey, beans, tofu, and egg whites. This will reduce the amount of fat and cholesterol in your diet, which is better for you overall.[11] X Research source </p>
<p> Check the item’s packaging to find the serving size. Serving sizes vary among different types of protein foods. For example, a serving of meat or fish is 3 oz (85 g) while serving of beans or cottage cheese is 1/2 cup (120 g). </p>
<p> Tip: You can reduce the fat content of meat by cutting off the fat or removing the skin before you eat it. </p>
<p> Limit your intake of oils and fats. A healthy level of fat in your diet is between 20 and 35%. For someone following a 2,000 calorie diet, this would work out to about 44 to 77 grams of fat daily since each gram is worth about 9 calories. But it’s best to consume healthy fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and limit or avoid unhealthy ones, such as saturated fats and trans fats. Include 2 to 3 servings of olive oil, nuts, seeds, or avocados in your daily diet to get healthy fats.[12] X Research source </p>
<p> Aim to get no more than 10% of your daily calories from saturated fat. For example, if you are on a 1,700 calorie per day diet, then no more than 170 of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. This works out to be about 19 grams of saturated fat per day. </p>
<p> Make sure that you check labels on foods to find the trans fat content. If a food contains trans fat, don’t buy it or eat it. Trans fats are commonly found in margarine, shortening, powdered coffee creamer, and many packaged convenience foods, such as packaged baked goods.[13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source </p>
<p> Drink mostly water and limit or avoid sugary drinks. Water will provide your body with the hydration it needs. You really don’t need to drink anything else. However, if you do drink other beverages, limit your intake of them. Limit your intake of fruit juice to no more than one 8 fl oz (240 mL) serving daily and avoid drinking sugary sodas and other naturally or artificially sweetened beverages.[14] X Research source </p>
<p> There’s no perfect amount of water for everyone to drink. Drink whenever you feel thirsty. If your urine is pale yellow and you don’t feel thirsty, you are well-hydrated. </p>
<p> Moderate alcohol intake is also fine. Drink no more than 1 alcoholic beverage daily if you’re a woman, or no more than 2 alcoholic beverages daily if you’re a man. One alcoholic beverage is 12 fl oz (350 mL) of beer, 5 fl oz (150 mL) of wine, or 1.5 fl oz (44 mL) of spirits.[15] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source </p>
<p> Allow yourself the occasional treat and don’t make any foods “off-limits.” While it’s important to make healthy choices most of the time, there will be times when you want to splurge, and that’s okay! As long as you’re eating healthy foods most of the time, it’s fine to have a treat, such as a donut, a couple of slices of pizza, or a milkshake now and then. Try to keep your treats to once or twice per week and plan them ahead of time to reduce the chances that you’ll overdo it.[16] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source </p>
<p> For example, you might plan to have pizza on a Friday night, or go for ice cream with your family on a Sunday afternoon. </p>
<p> Make sure to budget for the calories that your splurge will cost if you’re keeping track of calories with an app or food diary. For example, if you know that 2 slices of pizza will be about 600 calories, then you might eat a light lunch so you have more calories to spare. </p>
<p> Learn to identify when you’re actually hungry. Tuning in to your hunger signals can help you to avoid overeating or eating out of boredom. If you’re unsure if you’re hungry, take a moment to think when you ate last and how much you ate. If it’s been more than 3 hours, you may be hungry. If it’s been less than 3 hours, consider if your urge to eat might be motivated by something else.[17] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

<p> Some people use the acronym HALT to stop themselves from eating mindlessly. HALT stands for Hungry, Angry (or anxious), Lonely, and Tired. If you’re not hungry, ask yourself if you’re experiencing any of these emotions. Then, look for a way to deal with the feeling without food. </p>
<p> For example, if you’re angry (or anxious) about something, it might help you to pinpoint what it is. If you’re lonely, call up a friend and ask them to meet you. If you’re tired, a quick nap might help to refresh you.[18] X Research source </p>
<p> Eat your meals and snacks at regular intervals during the day. Eating at regular intervals will help to make sure your body has the fuel it needs to run all day. Have breakfast soon after you wake up to fuel yourself for the day. Then have a midmorning snack, lunch, an afternoon snack, and dinner.[19] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

<p> Eat dinner early to give your digestive system a break. Your body doesn’t need fuel while it’s resting, such as during the night when you’re asleep. Eating too close to bedtime can disrupt your sleep and your body won’t be able to burn this food as efficiently, so it might end up storing it on your body as excess fat. Aim to stop eating at least 3 hours before bedtime and allow your body a long break in between dinner and breakfast.[21] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

<p> For example, eat dinner at 6:00 pm if you go to bed at 9:30 pm. Then, don’t eat again until you have breakfast the following morning. </p>
<p> Try following an intermittent fasting diet. Intermittent fasting is when you keep your meals within the same 8 to 10 hour window during the most active part of each day. This limits when you can eat and gives your body more time to burn the calories you take in. You may find that you eat less as a result. Identify a window that works for you and commit to eating all of your meals within that time frame.[22] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

<p> 1the laws vary internally and/or they include exceptions for ritual/religious slaughter </p>
<p> The question of whether it is right to eat animal flesh is among the most prominent topics in food ethics.[1] People choose not to eat meat for various reasons such as concern for animal welfare, the environmental impact of meat production (environmental vegetarianism), health considerations[2] and antimicrobial resistance, which England's former chief medical officer Sally Davies said is as menacing as climate change.[3] Some argue that slaughtering animals solely because people enjoy the taste of meat is morally wrong or unjustifiable.[4][5] Vegans often abstain from other animal products for these reasons and/or because of opposition to industrial livestock production. For example, 95% of egg-laying hens in the United States are kept in wire battery cages, where their average living space is smaller than a standard piece of paper. This causes them to attack each other, so their beaks are cut off without anaesthetic.[6] Ethical vegetarians and ethical vegans[7] may also object to the practices underlying the production of meat, or cite concerns about animal welfare, animal rights, environmental ethics, and religious reasons. In response, some proponents of meat-eating have adduced various scientific, cultural, and religious arguments in support of the practice.[citation needed] Some meat-eaters only object to rearing animals in certain ways, such as in factory farms, or killing them with cruelty; others avoid only certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. </p>
<p> Overview of the argument against meat eating[edit] </p>
<p> Peter Singer—Princeton University and University of Melbourne professor and pioneer of the animal liberation movement—has long argued that, if it is possible to survive and be healthy without eating meat, fish, dairy, or eggs, one ought to choose that option instead of causing unnecessary harm to animals. In Animal Liberation, Singer argued that, because non-human animals feel, they should be treated according to utilitarian ethics. Singer's work has since been widely built upon by philosophers, both those who agree[9] and those who do not,[10] and it has been applied by animal rights advocates[11] as well as by ethical vegetarians and vegans. </p>
<p> Ethical vegetarians say that the reasons for not hurting or killing animals are similar to the reasons for not hurting or killing humans. They argue that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is not justifiable. Some ethicists have added that humans, unlike other animals, are morally conscious of their behavior and have a choice; this is why there are laws governing human behavior, and why it is subject to moral standards.[12] </p>
<p> Ethical vegetarian concerns have become more widespread in developed countries, particularly because of the spread of factory farming, more open and graphic documentation of what human meat-eating entails for the animal,[13] and environmental consciousness. Some proponents of meat-eating argue that the current mass demand for meat has to be satisfied with a mass-production system, regardless of the welfare of animals. Less radical proponents argue that practices like well-managed free-range rearing and the consumption of hunted animals, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could satisfy the demand for mass-produced meat.[14] Reducing the worldwide massive food waste would also contribute to reduce meat waste and therefore save animals.[15][16] According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about a third of the food for human consumption is wasted globally (around 1.3 billion tons per year).[17] </p>
<p> Some have described unequal treatment of humans and animals as a form of speciesism such as anthropocentrism or human-centeredness. Val Plumwood (1993, 1996) has argued that anthropocentrism plays a role in green theory that is analogous to androcentrism in feminist theory and ethnocentrism in anti-racist theory. Plumwood calls human-centredness "anthropocentrism" to emphasize this parallel. By analogy with racism and sexism, Melanie Joy has dubbed meat-eating "carnism". The animal rights movement seeks an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction drawn between human and non-human animals, an end to the status of animals as property, and an end to their use in the research, food, clothing, and entertainment industries.[18][19] Peter Singer, in his ethical philosophy of what it is to be a "person", argues that livestock animals feel enough to deserve better treatment than they receive. Many thinkers have questioned the morality not only of the double standard underlying speciesism but also the double standard underlying the fact that people support treatment of cows, pigs, and chickens that they would never allow with pet dogs, cats, or birds.[9] </p>
<p> Jay Bost, agroecologist and winner of The New York Times' essay contest on the ethics of eating meat, summarized his argument in the following way: "eating meat raised in specific circumstances is ethical; eating meat raised in other circumstances is unethical" in regard to environmental usage. He proposes that if "ethical is defined as living in the most ecologically benign way, then in fairly specific circumstances, of which each eater must educate himself, eating meat is ethical." The specific circumstances he mentions include using animals to cycle nutrients and convert sun to food.[20] Ethicists like Tom Regan and Peter Singer define "ethical" in terms of suffering rather than ecology. Mark Rowlands argues that the real determinant of whether it is ethical to cause suffering is whether there is any vital need to cause it; if not, then causing it is unethical.[9] </p>

<p> Ethologist Jane Goodall stated in the 2009 book The Inner World of Farm Animals that "farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are much more sensitive and intelligent than we ever imagined."[21] In 2012, a group of well known neuroscientists[22] stated in the "Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness in Non-Human Animals" that all mammals and birds (such as farm animals), and other animals, possess the neurological substrates that generate consciousness and are able to experience affective states.[23] Eugene Linden, author of The Parrot's Lament, suggests that many examples of animal behavior and intelligence seem to indicate both emotion and a level of consciousness that we would normally ascribe only to our own species. </p>
<p> Consciousness requires a certain kind of informational organization that does not seem to be "hard-wired" in humans, but is instilled by human culture. Moreover, consciousness is not a black-or-white, all-or-nothing type of phenomenon, as is often assumed. The differences between humans and other species are so great that speculations about animal consciousness seem ungrounded. Many authors simply assume that an animal like a bat has a point of view, but there seems to be little interest in exploring the details involved.[24] </p>
<p> Philosophers Peter Singer (Princeton), Jeff McMahan (Oxford) and others also counter that the issue is not one of consciousness, but of sentience.[25] </p>
<p> A related argument revolves around non-human organisms' ability to feel pain. If animals could be shown to suffer, as humans do, then many of the arguments against human suffering could be extended to animals.[26] One such reaction is transmarginal inhibition, a phenomenon observed in humans and some animals akin to mental breakdown. </p>
<p> People have assumed that intelligence is linked to the ability to suffer and that because animals have smaller brains they suffer less than humans. That is a pathetic piece of logic, sentient animals have the capacity to experience pleasure and are motivated to seek it, you only have to watch how cows and lambs both seek and enjoy pleasure when they lie with their heads raised to the sun on a perfect English summer's day. Just like humans.[27] </p>
<p> When people choose to do things about which they are ambivalent and which they would have difficulty justifying, they experience a state of cognitive dissonance, which can lead to rationalization, denial, or even self-deception. For example, a 2011 experiment found that, when the harm that their meat-eating causes animals is explicitly brought to people's attention, they tend to rate those animals as possessing fewer mental capacities compared to when the harm is not brought to their attention. This is especially evident when people expect to eat meat in the near future. Such denial makes it less uncomfortable for people to eat animals. The data suggest that people who consume meat go to great lengths to try to resolve these moral inconsistencies between their beliefs and behaviour by adjusting their beliefs about what animals are capable of feeling.[28] This perception can lead to paradoxical conclusions about the ethics and comfort involved in preferring certain types of meat over others. For example, venison or meat from a wild deer generally has a much higher nutritional quality and a much lower carbon footprint than meat from domestically-raised animals. In addition, it can be virtually assured that the deer was never bred or raised in unnatural conditions, confined to a cage, fed an unnatural diet of grain, or injected with any artificial hormones. However, since the necessary act of killing a deer to procure the venison is generally much more apparent to anyone who encounters this sort of meat, some people can be even more uncomfortable with eating this than meat from animals raised on factory farms. Many ethical vegetarians and ethical meat-eaters argue that it is behaviour rather than supporting beliefs that should be adjusted. </p>
<p> Some people choose to be vegetarian or vegan for environmental reasons. </p>
<p> According to a 2006 report by LEAD Livestock's Long Shadow, "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."[29] The livestock sector is probably the largest source of water pollution (due to animal wastes, fertilizers, and pesticides), contributing to eutrophication, human health problems, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. It accounts also for over 8% of global human water use. </p>
<p> Livestock production is by far the biggest user of land, as it accounts for 40% of the global land surface.[30] It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, and overfishing.[29][31][32] A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund found that 60% of biodiversity loss can be attributed to the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals.[33] Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products.[34] The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best thing we can do to slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.[35] A 2017 study published in the journal Carbon Balance and Management found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previously estimated.[36] In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a warning to humanity calling for, among other things, "promoting dietary shifts towards mostly plant-based foods."[37] A 2019 report in The Lancet recommended that global meat consumption be reduced by 50 percent to mitigate climate change.[38] </p>
<p> Many developing countries, including China and India, are moving away from traditional plant-based diets to meat-intensive diets as the result of modernization and globalization, which has facilitated the spread of Western consumer cultures around the world. Over 200 billion animals are consumed by the global population of over 7 billion every year, and meat consumption is projected to more than double by 2050 as the population grows to over 9 billion.[39] A 2018 study published in Science states that meat consumption could rise by as much as 76% by 2050 as the result of human population growth and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce biodiversity.[40] David Attenborough warned in 2020 that "the planet can't support billions of meat-eaters."[41] </p>
<p> Animals that feed on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops.[42] Producing 1 kg of meat requires up to 15,000 liters of water.[43] According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires nearly half of the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain.[44] However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems.[45] In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1.[46] The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits. </p>
<p> There are also environmentalist arguments in favor of the morality of eating meat. One such line of argument holds that sentience and individual welfare are less important to morality than the greater ecological good. Following environmentalist Aldo Leopold's principle that the sole criterion for morality is preserving the "integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community", this position asserts that sustainable hunting and animal agriculture are environmentally healthy and therefore good.[47][48] </p>
<p> Hinduism holds vegetarianism as an ideal for three reasons: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals; the intention to offer only "pure" (vegetarian) or sattvic food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; and the conviction that an insentient diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is detrimental for the mind and for spiritual development. Buddhist vegetarianism has similar strictures against hurting animals. The actual practices of Hindus and Buddhists vary according to their community and according to regional traditions. Jains are especially rigorous about not harming sentient organisms.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Islamic Law and Judaism have dietary guidelines called Halal and Kashrut, respectively. In Judaism, meat that may be consumed according to halakha (Jewish law) is termed kosher; meat that is not compliant with Jewish law is called treif. Causing unnecessary pain to animals is prohibited by the principle of tza'ar ba'alei chayim. While it is neither required nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Judaism, such as Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama, regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal. </p>
<p> Shinto has a concept of kegare, which means a state of pollution and defilement, and traditionally eating animals is thought to be one of them.[49] Eating animals having more legs is thought to be worse. (Eating mammals is worse than eating chickens or fish.) This concept leads to discrimination against slaughtermen and people who work with leather, who are called burakumin.[50][51] Shinran, the founder of the Buddhist sect Jōdo Shinshū, taught that lower class who had to kill beings could enter nirvana even though killing animals was thought to be immoral. </p>
<p> It has been argued that a moral community requires all participants to be able to make moral decisions, but animals are incapable of making moral choices (e.g., a tiger would not refrain from eating a human because it was morally wrong; it would decide whether to attack based on its survival needs, as dictated by hunger). Thus, some opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that the analogy between killing animals and killing people is misleading.[52] For example, Hsiao (2015) compares the moral severity of harming animals to that of picking a flower or introducing malware into a computer.[52] Others have argued that humans are capable of culture, innovation, and the sublimation of instinct in order to act in an ethical manner while animals are not, and so are unequal to humans on a moral level. This does not excuse cruelty, but it implies animals are not morally equivalent to humans and do not possess the rights a human has.[53] The precise definition of a moral community is not simple, but Hsiao defines membership by the ability to know one's own good and that of other members, and to be able to grasp this in the abstract. He claims that non-human animals do not meet this standard.[52] </p>
<p> Benjamin Franklin describes his conversion to vegetarianism in chapter one of his autobiography, but then he describes why he (periodically) ceased vegetarianism in his later life: </p>
<p> ...in my first voyage from Boston...our people set about catching cod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution of not eating animal food... But I had formerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of the frying-pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanc'd some time between principle and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I, "If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you." So I din'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people, returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.[54] </p>
<p> One study found that approximately 60% of contemporary professional ethicists consider it "morally bad" to eat meat from mammals.[55] Writing in Current Affairs, Nathan J. Robinson describes the billions of non-human animals that suffer and die at the hands of human beings for consumption as a "holocaust" and, citing Jeremy Bentham's formulation "The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?" contends that it is "morally reprehensible" and "deeply wrong".[56] Conversely, Jan Narveson argues that under certain theories of utilitarianism, positive utility can be increased by having more living organisms to experience it and thus by increasing the animal population so it can later be eaten, these theories could potentially justify raising animals for the purposes of consumption.[57] </p>
<p> Various programs operate in the US that promote the notion that animals raised for food can be treated humanely. Some spokespeople for the factory farming industry argue that the animals are better off in total confinement. For example, according to F J "Sonny" Faison, president of Carroll's Foods: </p>
<p> They're in state-of-the-art confinement facilities. The conditions that we keep these animals in are much more humane than when they were out in the field. Today they're in housing that is environmentally controlled in many respects. And the feed is right there for them all the time, and water, fresh water. They're looked after in some of the best conditions, because the healthier and [more] content that animal, the better it grows. So we're very interested in their well-being up to an extent.[58] </p>
<p> In response, animal welfare advocates ask for evidence that any factory-bred animal is better off caged than free.[59] Farm Sanctuary argue that commodifying and slaughtering animals is incompatible with the definition of "humane".[60] Animal ethicists such as Gary Francione have argued that reducing animal suffering is not enough; it needs to be made illegal and abolished. </p>
<p> Peter Singer[61] has pointed out that the ethical argument for vegetarianism may not apply to all non-vegetarian food. For example, any arguments against causing pain to animals would not apply to animals that do not feel pain. It has also often been noted that, while it takes a lot more grain to feed some animals such as cows for human consumption than it takes to feed a human directly, not all animals consume land plants (or other animals that consume land plants). For example, oysters consume underwater plankton and algae. In 2010, Christopher Cox wrote: </p>
<p> Biologically, oysters are not in the plant kingdom, but when it comes to ethical eating, they are almost indistinguishable from plants. Oyster farms account for 95 percent of all oyster consumption and have a minimal negative impact on their ecosystems; there are even nonprofit projects devoted to cultivating oysters as a way to improve water quality. Since so many oysters are farmed, there's little danger of overfishing. No forests are cleared for oysters, no fertilizer is needed, and no grain goes to waste to feed them—they have a diet of plankton, which is about as close to the bottom of the food chain as you can get. Oyster cultivation also avoids many of the negative side effects of plant agriculture: There are no bees needed to pollinate oysters, no pesticides required to kill off other insects, and for the most part, oyster farms operate without the collateral damage of accidentally killing other animals during harvesting.[62] </p>
<p> Cox went on to suggest that oysters would be acceptable to eat, even by strict ethical criteria, if they did not feel: "while you could give them the benefit of the doubt, you could also say that unless some new evidence of a capacity for pain emerges, the doubt is so slight that there is no good reason for avoiding eating sustainably produced oysters." Cox has added that, although he believes in some of the ethical reasons for vegetarianism, he is not strictly a vegan or even a vegetarian because he consumes oysters. </p>
<p> Critics of ethical vegetarianism say that there is no agreement on where to draw the line between organisms that can and cannot feel. Justin Leiber, a philosophy professor at Oxford University, writes that: </p>
<p> Montaigne is ecumenical in this respect, claiming consciousness for spiders and ants, and even writing of our duties to trees and plants. Singer and Clarke agree in denying consciousness to sponges. Singer locates the distinction somewhere between the shrimp and the oyster. He, with rather considerable convenience for one who is thundering hard accusations at others, slides by the case of insects and spiders and bacteria, they pace Montaigne, apparently and rather conveniently do not feel pain. The intrepid Midgley, on the other hand, seems willing to speculate about the subjective experience of tapeworms ...Nagel ... appears to draw the line at flounders and wasps, though more recently he speaks of the inner life of cockroaches.[63] </p>
<p> There are also some who argue that, although only suffering animals feel anguish, plants, like all organisms, have evolved mechanisms for survival. No living organism can be described as "wanting" to die for another organism's sustenance.[64] In an article written for The New York Times, Carol Kaesuk Yoon argues that: </p>
<p> When a plant is wounded, its body immediately kicks into protection mode. It releases a bouquet of volatile chemicals, which in some cases have been shown to induce neighboring plants to pre-emptively step up their own chemical defenses and in other cases to lure in predators of the beasts that may be causing the damage to the plants. Inside the plant, repair systems are engaged and defenses are mounted, the molecular details of which scientists are still working out, but which involve signaling molecules coursing through the body to rally the cellular troops, even the enlisting of the genome itself, which begins churning out defense-related proteins ... If you think about it, though, why would we expect any organism to lie down and die for our dinner? Organisms have evolved to do everything in their power to avoid being extinguished. How long would any lineage be likely to last if its members effectively didn't care if you killed them?[65] </p>
<p> Steven Davis, a professor of animal science at Oregon State University, argues that the least harm principle does not require giving up all meat. Davis states that a diet containing beef from grass-fed ruminants such as cattle would kill fewer animals than a vegetarian diet, particularly when one takes into account animals killed by agriculture.[66] </p>
<p> This conclusion has been criticized by Jason Gaverick Matheny (founder of in vitro meat organization New Harvest) because it calculates the number of animals killed per acre (instead of per consumer). Matheny says that, when the numbers are adjusted, Davis' argument shows veganism as perpetrating the least harm.[67] Davis' argument has also been criticized by Andy Lamey for being based on only two studies that may not represent commercial agricultural practices. When differentiating between animals killed by farm machinery and those killed by other animals, he says that the studies again show veganism to do the "least harm".[68] </p>
<p> Christopher Bobier argues that arguments against the consumption of factory-farmed meat can also apply to vegetables produced under factory conditions due to animals killed in the production process (arguing that alternative sources of vegetables mean factory-produced vegetables are not necessary) and thus does not represent a prima-facie argument for vegetarianism.[69] </p>
<p> One of the main differences between a vegan and a typical vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter, and yogurt. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they understand their production causes animal suffering or premature death[70] and because of the environmental effect of dairy production.[71][72] According to a report of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization in 2010 the dairy sector accounted for 4 percent of global man-made greenhouse gas emissions.[73][74] </p>
<p> To produce milk from dairy cattle, most calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and fed milk replacement in order to retain the cows' milk for human consumption.[75] Animal welfare advocates point out that this breaks the natural bond between the mother and her calf.[75] Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production.[75] To prolong lactation, dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through artificial insemination.[75] Although cows' natural life expectancy is about twenty years,[70] after about five years the cows' milk production has dropped; they are then considered "spent" and are sent to slaughter for meat and leather.[76][77] </p>
<p> Battery cages are the predominant form of housing for laying hens worldwide; these cages reduce aggression and cannibalism among hens, but are barren, restrict movement, and increase rates of osteoporosis.[78][79][80] In these systems and in free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are culled and killed at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens.[81] It is estimated that an average consumer of eggs who eats 200 eggs per year for 70 years of his or her life is responsible for the deaths of 140 birds, and that an average consumer of milk who drinks 190 kg per year for 70 years is responsible for the deaths of 2.5 cows.[82] </p>

<p> Expired Meat – How Long is Meat Good After Sell By Date? </p>
<p> Our priority at MoneySmartFamily is to help readers improve their finances and we partner with companies that could help you. Some links on this page are from our partners. Read how we earn money here. </p>
<p> Want to see people turn up their noses in disgust? Just mention that you often purchase expired meat or meat that is going out of code. </p>
<p> “Code” refers to the date placed by a grocer or manufacturer on a grocery item revealing its use-by, sell-by or freeze-by date. </p>
<p> We did an interview on ABC’s 20/20 with Elizabeth Vargas. When she saw a video clip of Steve selecting some discounted ham in a grocery store, she was puzzled. </p>
<p> She said, “You are picking up bargains on items most of us would avoid, like expiring meat.” </p>
<p> She continued, “Most people don’t want to buy meat that is expiring today. Why are you buying it, and more importantly, stocking up on it?” </p>
<p> [toc] </p>
<p> Is Expired Meat Safe to Eat? </p>
<p> What does the sell by date on meat mean? What a great question. Many consumers believe that meat that is close to, or beyond the “sell by date” must be “no good.” They believe that it should be disposed of immediately. They think it’s unclean, inedible and likely to make one who eats it violently ill. </p>
<p> We spoke with Dave, a long-time grocery store employee. He started in the meat department at a large grocery chain and worked his way up to assistant store manager. </p>
<p> He said that “in the old days,” butchers would un-package meat when it started turning a “green.” He would trim off the “bad parts” and then repackage it for sale. </p>
<p> What didn’t sell in the next few days, they’d cook and sell at a higher price or add to the ground beef mix in the back room. </p>
<p> The thought of unknown-quality meat going into ground beef may turn you into a vegetarian. This is one reason we grind our own beef (read about saving money on meat here). </p>
<p> But let’s evaluate the meat coding system. </p>
<p> Is Food Dating Required by Federal Law? </p>
<p> No. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not require the stamping of meat expiration dates. They say, “Except for infant formula and some baby food products, dating is not generally required by Federal regulations.” </p>
<p> Poultry producers are required to stamp the date their product is packaged. However, stores affix their own sell-by or use-by dates. </p>
<p> Furthermore, individual states have their own regulations regarding product labeling. </p>
<p> What do Food Dating Codes Really Mean? </p>
<p> Here is how the USDA defines various types of dating on meat packages: </p>
<p> A “Sell by date tells the store how long to display the product. You should buy the product before this date passes. </p>
<p> A Best-if-used-by date (or -before) is recommended for best flavor or quality. It is not a purchase or safety date. </p>
<p> A Use-by date is the last date recommended for use of the product while at peak quality. The product manufacturer determines this date. </p>
<p> Is Expiring Meat Safe to Buy? </p>
<p> The USDA Web site states, “After the date passes, while not of best quality, the product should still be safe if handled properly and kept at 40°F or below.” </p>
<p> We immediately freeze meat that is close to going out of code to halt the loss of quality and reduce bacterial risk. Remember that meat’s sell-by date is a “guesstimate” from the manufacturer. </p>
<p> Have you ever seen questionably colored meat in the butcher case days before going out of code? Your eyes are your best guide to determine the quality of the meat you are purchasing. </p>
<p> What Kind of Meat to Avoid Buying </p>
<p> Leakers Our friend Dave’s term for meat awash in excess water and blood, which may contain bacteria. </p>
<p> Puffers When vacuumed-packed meats lose their airtight seal and become inflated. Either air or bacteria may cause the problem. </p>
<p> Discolored Meat that looks a little green or darker brown, indicating loss of quality, Avoid it no matter what its code date. </p>
<p> Use Your Senses </p>
<p> Using your common sense and your eyes, you can choose meat going out of code that will be safe for your family to eat. So yes, a package of expired meat tomorrow is safe to buy today. </p>
<p> Oregon State University College of Health and Human Services published a food resource guide years ago. The guide said to dispose of meat that exhibits any one of the following: </p>
<p> Foul Odor Often due to microbial growth. Putrefaction may have occurred in protein foods with accompanying sewage-like odors. </p>
<p> Surface Slime Often, but not always, due to high bacterial counts. </p>
<p> Mold Exceptions are old-fashioned, cured ham and cheeses that are mold-ripened. </p>
<p> The document from OSU is no longer available on their website. </p>
<p> Packaging Meat Makes a Difference </p>
<p> Meat wrapped in a thin plastic wrap on a Styrofoam tray can be frozen for up to three months, but you will see deterioration — drying out of the meat. We have stored meats such as turkeys and corned beef vacuum-sealed in heavy plastic for up to one year with no noticeable loss in quality. </p>
<p> Paul VanLandingham, Ed.D., is a senior faculty member at the Center for Food and Beverage Management of Johnson & Wales University. He said regarding vacuum-sealed meats, “This can double shelf life. The item will be as good as the day it was packaged.” </p>
<p> Carlos, a butcher, and former Navy cook told us more about frozen meat storage. He said it was routine to stock a ship’s walk-in freezer with two years’ worth of frozen turkeys. This was done prior to a one-year tour of duty. He said, “Those birds store great in that thick plastic wrapping.” </p>
<p> So buying a package that will be expired meat tomorrow and sticking it in the freezer, stops the deterioration process. This meat will be fine to eat, several weeks from now. </p>
<p> Home Vacuum Sealers </p>
<p> When we cut up and repackage large cuts of meat, we always triple wrap them in plastic wrap. We make the wrapping as air-tight as possible and label the meat with the cut, date, and weight. </p>
<p> Another way to protect your meat purchases is to buy a home vacuum sealer. Between the heavy plastic they use and the lack of air because of the vacuum, the meat will last for a year or two. </p>
<p> Amazon sells some of the highest rated vacuum sealers. Read the reviews so you can make an informed better decision. They range in price from $40 to $200. Be sure to research the cost of replacement bags. </p>
<p> Does Purchasing Expiring Meat Really Save Money? </p>
<p> You bet it does. Each grocer codes meat differently. Smart & Final (a culinary warehouse club in the West) has a limit of 25 percent off, usually marked three days before the sell-by date. </p>
<p> Kroger / Fry’s stores have a maximum discount of 40 percent off, usually applied two days prior to code. Safeway stores use one- or two-dollars-off stickers, and typically add more discounts as the code date approaches. </p>
<p> A few months ago, as Steve stood at a meat case evaluating cuts going out of code, a butcher asked if he needed help. Steve replied, “I’d love to buy this meat, but it’s not quite at my buy price yet. Is there anything you can do?” </p>
<p> The butcher smiled, pulled out a roll of discount stickers and knocked another two dollars off the package. </p>
<p> You bet we bought it. This brings up another principle: Always ask, especially if it’s the last date for the code. You may get a really steep discount. </p>
<p> Saving 25 percent due to a sale or advertised price reduction is great, but we really love stumbling on a deal that saves us 50 to 80 percent. </p>
<p> A Small Warehouse Club Called Smart & Final </p>
<p> There is a smaller warehouse-type food store near our home that sells butcher cuts of beef and pork. These cuts are 10 to 20 pounds, vacuum sealed in heavy plastic. There have been many times where we’ve purchased 17 pounds of beef brisket, bottom round or some other cut that was close to going out of code. This store marks down their meat between 25 and 50 percent off. We bring it home and Steve has cut it into steaks and roasts. We label it and repackage it and put it in the freezer. </p>
<p> Yes, it takes some time to be a “butcher” of our own meat, but when you can get good cuts of meat at steeply discounted prices – it’s worth it. Just be sure to wear an apron when you’re cutting meat, it can get messy. </p>
<p> And if you do get some blood or other juices on the apron, be sure to read How to Get Blood out of Clothes and Sheets. We tested 9 different solutions to find what works best. </p>
<p> What do Grocery Stores do with Old Meat? </p>
<p> Some stores donate it to homeless shelters and soup kitchens. Others tell us they throw it away. Some manufacturers, have a buy-back policy with the stores. This is especially true of those who sell meat in vacuum-sealed packages. </p>
<p> Some butchers are allowed to buy the meat at a steep discount for themselves. But it must be before the expiration date passes. </p>
<p> To avoid lawsuits, one local grocer has a policy of firing for any employee who sells out-of-code meat. </p>
<p> Stocking up on and Storing Expired Meat </p>
<p> Of course, if you have a freezer, that is the best place to store your expiring meat. Stocking up when meat is going out of code, and freezing it, is the best way to keep that meat ready for when you will use it. </p>
<p> If you have your meat stored in the freezer, all you have to do is defrost it the night before or day of, when you want to use it. You can slow cook your meat in the crockpot, cook it in the oven or BBQ it on your grill. </p>
<p> There are so many great recipes on Pinterest for cooking up a great meal for your household! Thousands of pounds of good meat get thrown away each year. Is it due to the fear of litigation? Is it to protect public health? Or is it a ploy of meat producers to sell more meat to the stores? It could be a little of each. </p>
<p> But if you make friends with your local butcher, you might find some meat sharply discounted and able to make its way to your dinner table. And we think you could cheer about that. </p>
<p> What is Cross Contamination? </p>
<p> This is when germs or bacteria on kitchen tools like a knife or cutting board, get passed on to your meat or food. The germs we are talking about could be bacteria, but they could also be a virus or fungus. </p>
<p> And by fungus, we mean different kinds of molds. Mold usually appears on fruits or veggies that are damaged or old. This is why we carefully wash all of our produce in vinegar and water. Then we remove any damaged areas and trim stems whenever possible. </p>
<p> If you eat food that’s been cross-contaminated, and you feel sick, this could mean you have food poisoning. That’s why people are much more likely to get food poisoning from restaurants than at home. Restaurants have many surface areas being used. </p>
<p> They also have tons of food moving over these surface areas each day. And they have tons of different people working in those areas throughout different shifts on those days. </p>
<p> Your Home vs a Restaurant </p>
<p> Restaurants have the toughest time with cross-contamination, but this is NOT likely to happen in your home. Just be sure you are washing everything thoroughly as you switch from meats to vegetables or fruits, to starches. We have never had food poisoning in our home. </p>
<p> Read more about how to avoid cross-contamination at home from FoodSafety.gov. </p>
<p> Seniors & Food Contamination </p>
<p> We know of a sweet widowed elderly woman who insists on cooking for herself. And if she doesn’t cook for herself, then she buys a rotisserie chicken. The only problem with this is that Jackie is losing the use of some of her senses since she is 93 years old. </p>
<p> There are a couple of events at our house that she has missed because she wasn’t feeling good and had a tummy ache. Our hunch is that she actually had food poisoning because she wasn’t able to tell when her food has gone bad. </p>
<p> There is an easy solution. Someone needs to convince Jackie that rotisserie chickens are out and frozen dinners are in. </p>
<p> There are so many healthy choices for frozen meals and they are perfectly sized for a one person meal. This way there are fewer or no leftovers. And no opportunity for food to deteriorate and become harmful. The only problem is that we aren’t Jackie’s caretaker and she can be quite set in her ways at times. </p>
<p> If you have a senior in your life please watch over them carefully. If you can, start talking to them about different meal planning and food storage. Help them understand that things need to change over time. And help them be aware of the different choices they can make to stay healthy. </p>
<p> FDA.gov has a great article on food safety for senior adults. </p>
<p> Wrap-up on Expired Meat </p>
<p> If you use your senses and common sense, expired meat can mean awesome deals and very little danger. Keep your eyes open and be ready to move in for savings whenever you walk past the meat department. You’ll be amazed at the deals you find. </p>
<p> Other Resources About Meat </p>
<p> Here’s an article by Consumer Reports that presents much of what we’ve learned about expired meat. And an article by Forbes that clarifies what consumers should know about “sell-by” and “use by” dates. </p>
<p> Also, you may be interested in this article about knowing when meat is cheap, and you are getting a good deal. </p>

<p> Feeling Hungry After Eating: Why It Happens and What to Do </p>
<p> Hunger is your body’s way of letting you know it needs more food. </p>
<p> However, many people find themselves feeling hungry even after eating. Many factors, including your diet, hormones, or lifestyle, can explain this phenomenon. </p>
<p> This article helps explain why you may feel hungry after a meal and what to do about it. </p>
<p> There are several reasons why some people feel hungry after a meal. </p>
<p> Meal composition </p>
<p> For starters, it could be due to the nutritional composition of your meal. </p>
<p> Meals that contain a greater proportion of protein tend to induce greater feelings of fullness than meals with greater proportions of carbs or fat — even when their calorie counts are similar (1, 2, 3). </p>
<p> Numerous studies have shown that higher protein meals are better at stimulating the release of fullness hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY) (4, 5, 6). </p>
<p> Also, if your diet lacks fiber, you may find yourself feeling hungry more often. </p>
<p> Fiber is a type of carb that takes longer to digest and can slow your stomach’s emptying rate. When it’s digested in your lower digestive tract, it also promotes the release of appetite-suppressing hormones like GLP-1 and PYY (7). </p>
<p> Foods that are high in protein include meats, such as chicken breast, lean beef, turkey, and shrimp. Meanwhile, foods that are high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and grains. </p>
<p> If you find that you’re hungry after a meal and notice that your meals tend to lack protein and fiber, try incorporating more protein- and fiber-rich foods into your diet. </p>
<p> Stretch receptors </p>
<p> Aside from meal composition, your stomach has stretch receptors that play a key role in promoting feelings of fullness during and immediately after a meal. </p>
<p> The stretch receptors detect how much your stomach expands during a meal and send signals directly to your brain to induce feelings of fullness and reduce your appetite (8). </p>
<p> These stretch receptors don’t rely on the nutritional composition of food. Instead, they rely on the total volume of the meal (8). </p>
<p> However, feelings of fullness brought on by the stretch receptors don’t last long. So while they may help you eat less during a meal and shortly after, they don’t promote long-term feelings of fullness (8, 9). </p>
<p> If you don’t find yourself feeling full during or immediately after a meal, try incorporating more foods that are high in volume but low in calories (10, 11). </p>
<p> These foods, such as most fresh vegetables, fruits, air-popped popcorn, shrimp, chicken breast, and turkey, tend to have greater air or water content. Also, drinking water before or with meals adds volume to the meal and may further promote fullness (12). </p>
<p> Though many of these high volume, low calorie foods promote short-term, immediate fullness through the stretch receptors, they tend to be high in protein or fiber, both of which promote feelings of fullness long afterward by stimulating the release of fullness hormones. </p>
<p> Leptin resistance </p>
<p> In some cases, hormonal issues may explain why some people feel hungry after eating. </p>
<p> Leptin is the main hormone that signals feelings of fullness to your brain. It’s made by fat cells, so its blood levels tend to increase among people that carry more fat mass. </p>
<p> However, the problem is that sometimes leptin doesn’t work as well as it should in the brain, especially in some people with obesity. This is commonly called leptin resistance (13). </p>
<p> This means that although there’s plenty of leptin in the blood, your brain doesn’t recognize it as well and continues to think that you’re hungry — even after a meal (14). </p>
<p> Though leptin resistance is a complex issue, research suggests that getting in regular physical activity, reducing sugar intake, increasing fiber intake, and getting adequate sleep may help reduce leptin resistance (15, 16, 17, 18). </p>
<p> Behavioral and lifestyle factors </p>
<p> Aside from the key factors above, several behavioral factors may explain why you feel hungry after eating, including: </p>
<p> Being distracted while eating. Research suggests that people who eat distracted feel less full and have a greater desire to eat throughout the day. If you usually eat distracted, try practicing mindfulness to better recognize your body’s signals (19, 20). </p>
<p> Eating too quickly. Research suggests that fast eaters tend to feel less full than slow eaters due to a lack of chewing and awareness, which are linked to feelings of fullness. If you’re a fast eater, aim to chew your food more thoroughly (21, 22). </p>
<p> Feeling stressed. Stress raises the hormone cortisol, which may promote hunger and cravings. If you find that you’re often stressed, try incorporating yoga or meditation into your weekly routine (23). </p>
<p> Exercising a lot. People who exercise a lot tend to have greater appetites and faster metabolisms. If you exercise a lot, you may need to consume more food to fuel your workouts (24). </p>
<p> A lack of sleep. Adequate sleep is essential for regulating hormones, such as ghrelin, levels of which tend to be higher among sleep-deprived people. Try setting a healthy sleep routine or limiting blue light exposure at night to get adequate sleep (25, 26). </p>
<p> Not eating enough food. In some situations, you may feel hungry after eating simply because you didn’t eat enough during the day. </p>
<p> High blood sugar and insulin resistance. Having high blood sugar levels and insulin resistance can significantly increase your hunger levels (27). </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> You may feel hungry after eating due to a lack of protein or fiber in your diet, not eating enough high volume foods, hormone issues like leptin resistance, or behavioral and lifestyle choices. Try implementing some of the suggestions above. </p>
<p> Feeling hungry is a common problem for many people worldwide. </p>
<p> Often it’s the result of an inadequate diet that lacks protein or fiber. However, it could be due to hormone issues, such as leptin resistance, or your daily lifestyle. </p>
<p> If you often find yourself hungry after eating, try implementing some of the evidence-based suggestions above to help curb your appetite. </p>

<p> Fish and Meat </p>
<p> The Gemara Pesachim (76b) teaches that one may not cook fish and meat together since this combination is considered a sakana. Shulchan Aruch (Y.D. 116:2-3) adds that one may not even eat meat after fish or fish after meat unless one eats and drinks in between1. Rama adds that one should not cook open meat and fish in the same oven because of raicha (aroma), though bidieved we say that raicha lav milsa. Magen Avrohom (O.C. 173:1) questions whether this sakana still exists today, however the minhag is still to be machmir. </p>
<p> Taz 116:2 says that fish cooked with meat is forbidden, even if the fish is batel b’shishim. Although issurim are batel b’shishim, since fish and meat is a sakana, we have no right to assume that it follows the same guidelines. “Chamira sakanta m’issura”. </p>
<p> However, Shach (Nikudas Hakesef) disagrees and maintains that fish is batel b’shishim in meat. This is the accepted opinion of most poskim. The Shevus Yaakov adds that since today it is questionable whether there exists any sakana (Magen Avrohom), one need not be machmir when there is shishim. </p>
<p> Therefore, products that contain amounts of fish that are not batel b’shishim must be labeled OU Fish, so that consumers will not unwittingly eat the product together with meat. If the amount of fish in the product is batel b’shishim, we do not require the product to be labeled OU Fish, provided that the fish ingredient is mentioned somewhere on the packaging. In this way, those who wish to be machmir for the opinion of Taz can do so by scanning the ingredient label. If the fish ingredient is not listed on the label or is ambiguous, (Omega-3 oil) then the product should be labeled OU Fish. </p>
<p> However, Rav Belsky said that if the product contains fish gelatin that is batel b’shishim then there is no need to label the product OU Fish even if it does not appear in the ingredients. For example, some flavors use fish gelatin as a carrier and would not be listed. If the amount of gelatin is batel b’shishim, there is no need to label the product OU Fish, even though fish is not listed on the packaging. Since fish gelatin is denatured and then refined, it is unclear whether there is any sakana for it to be eaten with meat. In this case, we need not be machmir provided it is batel b’shishim. </p>
<p> Although there is no chashash that dairy items will be eaten together with meat, still it is proper to label them OU Dairy Fish if the fish is not batel b’shishim to accommodate Sefardim that consider it a sakana to eat dairy and fish together. </p>
<p> It should be noted that though there is a sakana to eat meat and fish together, it is permissible to cook meat in fish kailim or to cook fish in meat kailim3. This is even true of a davar charif. For example an onion cut with a meat knife may be cooked together fish4. However, all of this is provided that the kailim are clean from all residue. It is not sufficient to merely wipe off a knife or spatula that was used for meat to then use it for fish, but rather it must be properly cleaned. </p>
<p> Summary: Because of the potential sakana of eating fish and meat together </p>
<p> We must label foods OU Fish if they contain levels of fish that are not batel </p>
<p> If the amount of fish is batel and it is listed on the ingredient panel then it need not be labeled OU Fish. </p>
<p> Fish gelatin that is batel in a product need not be labeled OU Fish </p>
<p> It is proper to label dairy items that contain fish OU Dairy Fish </p>
<p> Although there is no sakana to cook fish with meat kailim, the kailim must be clean. </p>
<p> Shulchan Aruch also requires washing one’s hands between fish and meat, but Rama says that this is not necessary. </p>
<p> It is clear from the Poskim that discuss this issue that they are still concerned about sakana even today. However, the opinion of the Magen Avrohom is used as a mitigating factor when there are other reasons to be lenient (See Shevus Yaakov III:70 and Yad Efrayim Y.D. 116). </p>

<p> Many species of fish are consumed as food in virtually all regions around the world. Fish has been an important source of protein and other nutrients for humans throughout history. </p>
<p> Since 1961, the average annual increase in global apparent food fish consumption (3.2 percent) has outpaced population growth (1.6 percent) and exceeded consumption of meat from all terrestrial animals, combined (2.8 percent) and individually (bovine, ovine, pig, other), except poultry (4.9 percent). In per capita terms, food fish consumption has grown from 9.0 kg in 1961 to 20.2 kg in 2015, at an average rate of about 1.5 percent per year.[1] The expansion in consumption has been driven not only by increased production, but also by a combination of many other factors, including reduced wastage, better utilization, improved distribution channels and growing demand, linked with population growth, rising incomes and urbanization.[1] </p>
<p> Europe, Japan and the United States of America together accounted for 47 percent of the world's total food fish consumption in 1961 but only about 20 percent in 2015. Of the global total of 149 million tonnes in 2015, Asia consumed more than two-thirds (106 million tonnes at 24.0 kg per capita).[1] Oceania and Africa consumed the lowest share. The shift is the result of structural changes in the sector and in particular the growing role of Asian countries in fish production, as well as a significant gap between the economic growth rates of the world's more mature fish markets and those of many increasingly important emerging markets around the world, particularly in Asia.[1] </p>
<p> Over 32,000 species of fish have been described,[2] making them the most diverse group of vertebrates. In addition, there are many species of shellfish. However, only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Common species of fish and shellfish used for food[3] </p>
<p> The British historian William Radcliffe wrote in Fishing from the Earliest Times: </p>
<p> "The Emperor Domitian (Juvenal, IV.) ordered a special sitting of the Senate to deliberate and advise on a matter of such grave State importance as the best method of cooking a turbot."[4] </p>
<p> Globally, fish and fish products provide an average of only about 34 calories per capita per day. However more than as an energy source, the dietary contribution of fish is significant in terms of high-quality, easily digested animal proteins and especially in fighting micronutrient deficiencies.[1] A portion of 150g of fish provides about 50 to 60 percent of an adult's daily protein requirement. Fish proteins are essential in the diet of some densely populated countries where the total protein intake is low, and are particularly important in diets in small island developing States (SIDS).[1] </p>
<p> Intermediate Technology Publications wrote in 1992 that "Fish provides a good source of high quality protein and contains many vitamins and minerals. It may be classed as either whitefish, oily fish, or shellfish. Whitefish, such as haddock and seer, contain very little fat (usually less than 1%) whereas oily fish, such as sardines, contain between 10–25%. The latter, as a result of its high fat content, contain a range of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) and essential fatty acids, all of which are vital for the healthy functioning of the body."[7] </p>
<p> Eating oily fish containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may reduce systemic inflammation and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.[8][9] Eating about (140 grams (4.9 oz)) of oily fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids twice per week is a recommended consumption amount.[8][9] Increasing intake of omega-3 fatty acids may slightly reduce the risk of a fatal heart attack,[9] but likely has little effect on the overall number of deaths from cardiovascular disease.[10] </p>
<p> Fish is the most common food to obstruct the airway and cause choking. Choking on fish was responsible for about 4,500 reported accidents in the UK in 1998.[11] </p>
<p> A seafood allergy is a hypersensitivity to an allergen which can be present in fish, and particularly in shellfish. This can result in an overreaction of the immune system and lead to severe physical symptoms.[12] Most people who have a food allergy also have a seafood allergy.[13] Allergic reactions can result from ingesting seafood, or by breathing in vapours from preparing or cooking seafood.[14] The most severe seafood allergy reaction is anaphylaxis, an emergency requiring immediate attention. It is treated with epinephrine.[15] </p>
<p> A specially prepared dish of the poisonous blowfish fugu, Japan </p>
<p> Some species of fish, notably the puffer fugu used for sushi, and some kinds of shellfish, can result in serious poisoning if not prepared properly. These fish always contain these poisons as a defense against predators; it is not present due to environmental circumstances. Particularly, fugu has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the national examination in Japan. Ciguatera poisoning can occur from eating larger fish from warm tropical waters, such as sea bass, grouper, barracuda, and red snapper.[16] Scombroid poisoning can result from eating large oily fish which have sat around for too long before being refrigerated or frozen. This includes scombroids such as tuna and mackerel, but can also include non-scombroids such as mahi-mahi and amberjack.[16] The poison is odourless and tasteless.[17] </p>
<p> Many fish eat algae and other organisms that contain biotoxins (defensive substances against predators). Biotoxins accumulated in fish/shellfish include brevetoxins, okadaic acid, saxitoxins, ciguatoxin and domoic acid. Except for ciguatoxine, high levels of these toxins are only found in shellfish. Both domoic acid and ciguatoxine can be deadly to humans; the others will only cause diarrhea, dizziness and a (temporary) feeling of claustrophobia.[18][19] </p>
<p> Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, usually followed by headaches, muscle aches, paresthesia, numbness, ataxia, vertigo, and hallucinations. </p>
<p> Skin flushing, throbbing headache, oral burning, abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhea, palpitations, sense of unease, and, rarely, collapse or loss of vision. Symptoms occur usually within 10–30 minutes of ingesting spoiled fish. </p>
<p> Rhabdomyolysis, that is, a swelling and breakdown of skeletal muscle (with a risk of acute kidney failure) within 24 hours after consuming fish </p>
<p> A toxic cause is suspected but has not been proven </p>
<p> Vomiting and nausea and a variety of neurological symptoms such as slurred speech. Not fatal though it may require hospitalization. </p>
<p> Includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and tingling or burning sensations. Other symptoms also possible. </p>
<p> The toxins responsible for most shellfish and fish poisonings, including ciguatera and scombroid poisoning, are heat-resistant to the point where conventional cooking methods do not eliminate them.[17] </p>
<p> * indicates methylmercury only was analyzed (all other results are for total mercury) </p>
<p> According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the risk from mercury by eating fish and shellfish is not a health concern for most people.[37] However, certain seafood contains sufficient mercury to harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. The FDA makes three recommendations for child-bearing women and young children: </p>
<p> Eat up to 12 ounces (2 average meals) a week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury. Four of the most commonly eaten fish that are low in mercury are canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish. Another commonly eaten fish, albacore ("white tuna") has more mercury than canned light tuna. So, when choosing your two meals of fish and shellfish, you may eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) of albacore tuna per week. </p>
<p> Check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. If no advice is available, eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) per week of fish you catch from local waters, but don't consume any other fish during that week. </p>
<p> These recommendations are also advised when feeding fish and shellfish to young children, but in smaller portions.[37] </p>
<p> When the ocean conservation organization Oceana examined over 1,200 seafood samples of seafood sold in the U.S between 2010 and 2012, they found one-third were mislabelled. The highest rate of mislabelling occurred with snapper at 87 percent, followed by tuna at 57 percent.[38] </p>
<p> If fish and shellfish inhabit polluted waters, they can accumulate other toxic chemicals, particularly fat-soluble pollutants containing chlorine or bromine, dioxins or PCBs.[39] Fish that is to be eaten should be caught in unpolluted water. Some organisations such as SeafoodWatch, RIKILT, Environmental Defense Fund, IMARES provide information on species that do not accumulate much toxins/metals.[40][41][42][43] </p>
<p> Differential symptoms of parasite infections by raw fish. All have gastrointestinal, but otherwise distinct, symptoms.[44][45][46][47] </p>
<p> Parasites in fish are a natural occurrence and common. Though not a health concern in thoroughly cooked fish, parasites are a concern when consumers eat raw or lightly preserved fish such as sashimi, sushi, ceviche, and gravlax. The popularity of such raw fish dishes makes it important for consumers to be aware of this risk. Raw fish should be frozen to an internal temperature of −20 °C (−4 °F) for at least 7 days to kill parasites. Home freezers may not be cold enough to kill parasites.[48][49] </p>
<p> Traditionally, fish that live all or part of their lives in fresh water were considered unsuitable for sashimi due to the possibility of parasites (see Sashimi article). Parasitic infections from freshwater fish are a serious problem in some parts of the world, particularly Southeast Asia[citation needed]. Fish that spend part of their life cycle in brackish or fresh water, like salmon, are a particular problem. A study in Seattle, Washington showed that 100% of wild salmon had roundworm larvae capable of infecting people. In the same study farm-raised salmon did not have any roundworm larvae.[50] </p>
<p> Parasite infection by raw fish is rare in the developed world (fewer than 40 cases per year in the U.S.[citation needed]), and involves mainly three kinds of parasites: Clonorchis sinensis (a trematode/fluke), Anisakis (a nematode/roundworm) and Diphyllobothrium (a cestode/tapeworm). Infection risk of anisakis is particularly higher in fishes which may live in a river such as salmon (sake) in Salmonidae or mackerel (saba). Such parasite infections can generally be avoided by boiling, burning, preserving in salt or vinegar, or freezing overnight. In Japan it is common to eat raw salmon and ikura, but these foods are frozen overnight prior to eating to prevent infections from parasites, particularly anisakis.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Since fish is animal flesh, the Vegetarian Society has stated that vegetarian diets cannot contain fish.[51] </p>
<p> The neologism pescetarians covers those who eat fish and other seafood, but not mammals and birds.[52] Pescatarians may consume fish based solely upon the idea that the fish are not factory farmed as land animals are (i.e., their problem is with the capitalist-industrial production of meat, not with the consumption of animal foods themselves).[53][better source needed] </p>
<p> A 1999 metastudy combined data from five studies from western countries. The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for pescetarians to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mortality ratio of 1.00. However, the "lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts".[54] </p>
<p> Religious rites and rituals regarding food also tend to classify the birds of the air and the fish of the sea separately from land-bound mammals.[55] Sea-bound mammals are often treated as fish under religious laws – as in Jewish dietary law, which forbids the eating of cetacean meat, such as whale, dolphin or porpoise, because they are not "fish with fins and scales"; nor, as mammals, do they chew their cud and have cloven hooves, as required by Leviticus 11:9–12. Jewish (kosher) practice treat fish differently from other animal foods. The distinction between fish and "meat" is codified by the Jewish dietary law of kashrut, regarding the mixing of milk and meat, which does not forbid the mixing of milk and fish. Modern Jewish legal practice (halakha) on kashrut classifies the flesh of both mammals and birds as "meat"; fish are considered to be parve, neither meat nor a dairy food. (The preceding portion refers only to the halakha of Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews do not mix fish with dairy.)[citation needed] </p>
<p> Seasonal religious prohibitions against eating meat do not usually include fish. For example, non-fish meat was forbidden during Lent and on all Fridays of the year in pre-Vatican II Roman Catholicism, but fish was permitted (as were eggs). (See Fasting in Catholicism.) In Eastern Orthodoxy, fish is permitted on some fast days when other meat is forbidden, but stricter fast days also prohibit fish with spines, while permitting invertebrate seafood such as shrimp and oysters, considering them "fish without blood."[citation needed] </p>
<p> Among the Somali people, most clans have a taboo against the consumption of fish, and do not intermarry with the few occupational clans that do eat it.[56][57] </p>
<p> There are taboos on eating fish among many upland pastoralists and agriculturalists (and even some coastal peoples) inhabiting parts of southeastern Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, and northern Tanzania. This is sometimes referred to as the "Cushitic fish-taboo", as Cushitic speakers are believed to have been responsible for the introduction of fish avoidance to East Africa, though not all Cushitic groups avoid fish. The zone of the fish taboo roughly coincides with the area where Cushitic languages are spoken, and as a general rule, speakers of Nilo-Saharan and Semitic languages do not have this taboo, and indeed many are watermen.[57][58] The few Bantu and Nilotic groups in East Africa that do practice fish avoidance also reside in areas where Cushites appear to have lived in earlier times. Within East Africa, the fish taboo is found no further than Tanzania. This is attributed to the local presence of the tsetse fly and in areas beyond, which likely acted as a barrier to further southern migrations by wandering pastoralists, the principal fish-avoiders. Zambia and Mozambique's Bantus were therefore spared subjugation by pastoral groups, and they consequently nearly all consume fish.[57] </p>
<p> There is also another center of fish avoidance in Southern Africa, among mainly Bantu speakers. It is not clear whether this disinclination developed independently or whether it was introduced. It is certain, however, that no avoidance of fish occurs among southern Africa's earliest inhabitants, the Khoisan. Nevertheless, since the Bantu of southern Africa also share various cultural traits with the pastoralists further north in East Africa, it is believed that, at an unknown date, the taboo against the consumption of fish was similarly introduced from East Africa by cattle-herding peoples who somehow managed to get their livestock past the aforementioned tsetse fly endemic regions.[57] </p>
<p> Certain species of fish are also forbidden in Judaism such as the freshwater eel (Anguillidae) and all species of catfish. Although they live in water, they appear to have no fins or scales (except under a microscope) (see Leviticus 11:10–13[59]). Sunni Muslim laws are more flexible in this and catfish and shark are generally seen as halal as they are special types of fish. Eel is generally considered permissible in the four Sunni madh'hab, but the Ja'fari jurisprudence followed by most Shia Muslims forbids it.[60][61][62] </p>

<p> Can You Eat Fish Skin, and Is It Healthy? </p>
<p> Fish is a source of animal protein enjoyed by many people around the world on a regular basis. </p>
<p> In fact, it’s estimated that humans eat more than 330 billion pounds (150 million tonnes) of fish each year (1). </p>
<p> Fish is nutrient-dense, delicious, and a healthy addition to any meal. You may wonder if these properties apply to the skin as well. </p>
<p> This article reviews the benefits and safety of eating fish skin and explains how to include it in your diet. </p>
<p> Some people may avoid fish skin out of fear that it’s unsafe to eat, though this is generally not the case. </p>
<p> Fish skin has been eaten safely throughout history. It’s even a popular snack in many countries and cultures. </p>
<p> As long as fish have been properly cleaned and the outer scales fully removed, the skin is typically safe to eat. </p>
<p> Because fish is a great source of nutrients like iron and omega-3 fatty acids, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends eating a 4-ounce (113-gram) serving of fish 2–3 times per week (2). </p>
<p> However, some fish contain high levels of mercury and other toxins and contaminants, all of which can be present in the skin as well (3, 4, 5). </p>
<p> Therefore, choosing low-mercury fish more often than high-mercury fish is recommended. Here are a few examples of the typical mercury content of fish (2): </p>
<p> Low: catfish, cod, flounder, pollock, salmon, tilapia, most canned tunas </p>
<p> High: king mackerel, marlin, shark, swordfish, tile fish </p>
<p> In short, fish skin doesn’t pose any health risks greater than those of consuming the flesh of fish. Use similar guidelines to choose fish skin as you would when choosing the types of fish to eat. </p>
<p> summary </p>
<p> Fish skin is safe to eat as long as the fish has been cleaned and properly cared for prior to eating. Eating the skin of fish that are lower in mercury and other contaminants will limit your exposure to potentially harmful chemicals. </p>
<p> The exact nutritional profile of fish skin varies significantly depending on the type of fish. That said, most fish are rich in a few key nutrients. </p>
<p> Eating fish skin from a variety of fatty and lean fish can help ensure adequate intake of nutrients, including (6): </p>
<p> vitamin E </p>
<p> Here’s a closer look at some of the specific benefits these nutrients in fish skin may provide. </p>
<p> A good source of protein </p>
<p> Fish, including its skin, is a great source of dietary protein — an essential nutrient that serves as building blocks for tissues like muscles in the human body. </p>
<p> Protein may also contribute to optimal health by reducing the risk of certain disorders like stunted growth, low iron levels, and swelling in the body (7). </p>
<p> Moreover, some proteins, such as histones and transferrin, play a role in immunity. Many of these proteins are present in the mucus of fish skin (8). </p>
<p> High in protective omega-3s </p>
<p> One of the best known benefits of fatty fish is their high level of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. </p>
<p> Consuming the omega-3 fatty acids in the skin of oily fish may contribute to optimal health with benefits like heart protection, healthy pregnancies, and a reduced risk of brain diseases (9). </p>
<p> May support skin health </p>
<p> Eating fish skin may also improve your skin health. </p>
<p> Fish skin is a good source of collagen and vitamin E, both of which contribute to healthy human skin (10). </p>
<p> For example, studies have found that collagen could improve skin hydration, elasticity, and other trademarks of aging like wrinkles (11, 12). </p>
<p> Collagen is a type of protein present in all parts and types of fish — thus, you’ll find it in both scales, bones, flesh, and skin. On the other hand, vitamin E is a fat soluble antioxidant, more commonly found in oily fish like salmon and trout. </p>
<p> Vitamin E supports skin health by protecting against the harmful effects of the sun and by improving symptoms of certain skin conditions like eczema (13, 14). </p>
<p> May boost your nutrient intake </p>
<p> Eating the skin along with the flesh helps you consume the most nutrients possible from fish. </p>
<p> By removing the skin and eating only the flesh, you’ll miss out on the many beneficial nutrients and oils in the skin, as well as those found in the mucus and layers of flesh just below the skin. </p>
<p> summary </p>
<p> Fish skin is a great source of nutrients that support optimal human health, such as protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin E. Consuming fish skin could contribute to muscle growth, improved heart health, and healthy skin. </p>
<p> To reap the benefits of fish skin, it helps if you know the tastiest ways to prepare it. </p>
<p> When preparing a piece of skin-on fish, try panfrying or grilling it at a high temperature with the skin side down for a crispy result. </p>
<p> Avoid boiling and steaming the fish as this could result in a soggy or slimy texture of the skin. </p>
<p> Also, keep in mind that the taste of fish skin differs between types. Fish known for having delicious skin include bass, barramundi, flounder, mackerel, salmon, and snapper. </p>
<p> On the other hand, less tasty skin is found on monkfish, skate, swordfish, and tuna. </p>
<p> Further, chefs are getting creative with fish skin on restaurant menus. It’s not uncommon to see fish skin fried or cooked separately and served as an appetizer or side dish. </p>
<p> Flavored fish skin snacks are also getting more common and are already popular in Asian cuisines. These snacks are typically deep fried and salted and can be high in fat and sodium. </p>
<p> Therefore, it’s best to enjoy fried fish skin snacks in moderation. Further, if you have any underlying conditions like heart disease and high blood pressure, you may want to avoid them to not exacerbate any current conditions. </p>
<p> summary </p>
<p> Fish skin can be prepared in various ways. It can be seared at a high temperature for a crispy texture or removed from the flesh and fried. Certain types of fish skin taste better than others. </p>
<p> Fish skin is a delicious and nutritious part of the fish. </p>
<p> It’s rich in the same nutrients found in the flesh of fish, and consuming fish with the skin on helps ensure nutrients aren’t lost during the cooking process. </p>
<p> The nutrients in fish have a wide range of benefits, including support of heart and skin health. </p>
<p> Fish skin is very versatile as a culinary ingredient. You can try preparing it a few different ways to learn which ones you prefer. </p>

<p> It's Now Safe to Eat Food That's Been Dropped on the Floor </p>
<p> If you've been using the five-second rule—you know, the age-old principle that says food that's been dropped on the floor is still safe to eat if picked up within five seconds or less—your entire life (as we have), prepare to question everything you've ever known about food and germs. Why? Because a new study has just discovered that the five-second rule should really be the 30-minute rule for certain foods. </p>
<p> You read that right: Some foods can be dropped and left on the floor for up to a half an hour and still be safe to eat. According to the study out of Aston University in Birmingham, England, "rigid foods"—such as biscuits, cookies, sandwiches, dry toast, and chocolate—can be on the floor for up to 30 minutes with little increased risk of attracting germs. "Dry foods, hard foods are really quite low-risk," the lead researcher, professor Anthony Hilton, told the Daily Mail. "Not only do they not pick up much bacteria on impact with the floor, but they do not get any additional contamination over time." </p>
<p> The study did find, though, that certain foods were likely to pick up more bacteria the longer they remained on the floor. That list includes things like cooked pasta, chips, donuts, sweets, and buttered toast. "It is less safe to leave damper, stickier foods, which pick up more after falling and more over time," Hilton said. "The five-second rule probably does still apply to them." </p>
<p> It also matters what type of flooring the food falls onto: Foods dropped on laminate or tile became more contaminated than those dropped on carpet. But across all types of flooring, the food dropped picked up fewer than .0004 percent of the average 10 million bacteria found on a family floor. </p>
<p> So here comes the good news, germophobes: It is generally safe to eat all food that has been dropped on a residential floor that is mopped or vacuumed once a week, no matter the timing. "The chances of anyone getting ill from dropping food on the floor at home are infinitesimally small," Hilton said. "Obviously, food covered with invisible dirt shouldn't be eaten, but as long as it's not obviously contaminated, the science shows that food is unlikely to have picked up harmful bacteria from a few seconds spent on an indoor floor." </p>
<p> We can't decide which bacteria-related revelation is better: Being able to safely eat food off the floor or never having to make our bed again, we love science. </p>

<p> 13 Bible Verses about Food Offered To Idols </p>
<p> Most Relevant Verses </p>
<p> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies. If anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know; but if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.read more. Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world, and that there is no God but one. For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords, yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist through Him. However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. But food will not commend us to God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat. But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols? For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died. And so, by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble. </p>
<p> Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say. Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ?read more. Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread. Look at the nation Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar? What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we? All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify. Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor. Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience’ sake; for the earth is the Lord’s, and all it contains. If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience’ sake. But if anyone says to you, “This is meat sacrificed to idols,” do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for conscience’ sake; I mean not your own conscience, but the other man’s; for why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks? Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God; just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit but the profit of the many, so that they may be saved. </p>
<p> but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood. </p>
<p> that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell.” </p>
<p> But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote, having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication.” </p>
<p> For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. Thus they have committed adultery with their idols and even caused their sons, whom they bore to Me, to pass through the fire to them as food. </p>
<p> For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary on the same day to profane it; and lo, thus they did within My house. </p>
<p> otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they would play the harlot with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone might invite you to eat of his sacrifice, </p>
<p> For they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. </p>
<p> So the next day they rose early and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. </p>
<p> Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.” </p>
<p> But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality. </p>
<p> But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My bond-servants astray so that they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. </p>

<p> This guide has all you need to know about what to eat and what to avoid on a keto diet. You’ll enjoy delicious meals and eat as much as you need to feel full for hours. With this simple plan, you can lose weight, improve your health, and feel better without ever counting a single calorie! </p>
<p> Foods to eat </p>
<p> A healthy keto diet is built on whole, nutrient-dense foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, and non-starchy vegetables, along with natural fats like butter or olive oil. Use the food lists below to choose foods that keep you at less than 20 grams of net carbs per day (total carbs minus fiber). </p>
<p> Meat, poultry and substitutes </p>
<p> Meats are perfect for keto. You can have beef, pork, lamb, wild game, and poultry of all kinds. Soy products like tofu and tempeh also work. You can also have deli meats like sausages and cold cuts. Choose items with no added sugars, starches, or breading to keep your carbs low. </p>
<p> Fish and seafood </p>
<p> Most fish and shellfish are keto-friendly. Fatty fishes such as salmon, sardines, mackerel, and herring are excellent choices, as are mild white fishes such as cod, halibut, and trout. Choose fish and seafood without added sugars or breading to keep your carbs low. </p>
<p> Eggs </p>
<p> Eggs are delicious, portable, and vegetarian-friendly. Try them boiled, fried in butter, or in an omelet for a quick, inexpensive meal. Enjoy eggs as often as you’d like because when you avoid carbs, you don’t have to avoid dietary cholesterol. </p>
<p> in quiches or frittatas </p>
<p> Keto-friendly vegetables </p>
<p> Enjoy unlimited non-starchy vegetables such as leafy greens and crunchy salad veggies such as cucumber, celery, and radishes. Other favorites include cauliflower, cabbage, avocado, broccoli, and zucchini. Fresh or frozen, most vegetables that grow above-ground are keto-friendly. You can even eat a vegetarian keto diet. </p>
<p> Fruit and berries </p>
<p> Most tart fruits, such as berries, lemons, and limes are fine if you keep the serving size small. The same is true for melons because of their high water content. But almost all other fruit contains too much sugar. A small scoop of fresh berries served with real whipped cream and shaved dark chocolate makes a lush, delicious keto dessert. </p>
<p> Nuts and seeds </p>
<p> Many nuts and seeds are low in carbs. Just watch out for two things. First, don’t eat too many! Start with just a few or up to ¼ cup (about 25 grams) for a snack. And the kind of nut you choose matters. Some nuts, such as cashews, are much higher in carbs than others, such as pecans or macadamia nuts. You can also enjoy pumpkin, sunflower, and other seeds on keto. </p>
<p> Cheese and full-fat dairy </p>
<p> Cheese, butter, and cream can all be part of a keto diet. Greek yogurt in particular, makes for a protein-rich breakfast with few carbs. Avoid flavored low-fat yogurt that is often full of added sugar. </p>
<p> Note: Avoid drinking milk as the milk sugar quickly adds up (one glass = 15 grams of carbs). However, you can use it sparingly — a tablespoon or so — in your coffee. Also, regularly snacking on cheese when you’re not hungry is a common mistake that can slow down weight loss. </p>
<p> Fats and sauces </p>
<p> Don’t fear fat. It can help you feel fuller longer. Most of your fat should come with protein-rich foods like meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. But you can also cook with olive oil, top your veggies with cheese, and add dressings to salads. Rich sauces — think Bearnaise sauce, garlic butter, and mayo — can also be part of a keto diet, but if you are trying to lose weight, use only enough to make your meals enjoyable. </p>
<p> You can quickly learn more about the best keto foods to eat in this video: </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> Base your meals on meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and other protein-rich foods. Include lots of leafy greens, non-starchy veggies, and salads. Use fats such as butter or olive oil for flavor — and to fill in any needed calories. </p>

<p> Foods to avoid on keto </p>
<p> Avoid sugary food </p>
<p> Sugary foods are strictly limited on nearly every diet, and keto is no different. Avoid sodas, candy, sports drinks, cookies, biscuits, desserts, cakes, pastries, sweetened yogurts, ice cream, and breakfast cereals. </p>
<p> Most fruit has too much sugar for keto. Mangoes, grapes, and bananas have an entire day’s worth of carbs in a one-cup (about 200 gram) serving. </p>
<p> Even savory products, such as ketchup, pasta sauce, and salad dressings often contain sugar. Read labels carefully to avoid these. </p>
<p> Natural sweeteners, such as honey, maple syrup, and agave are sugars. There are dozens of names for sugar. Try to avoid it, regardless of name. </p>
<p> Avoid starchy food </p>
<p> All starches turn into sugar when digested. Many foods you’ve been told are “healthy” end up as sugar and can prevent you from losing weight or reaching your health goals. </p>
<p> Starchy foods to avoid include bread, tortillas, pasta, rice, couscous, potatoes, French fries, chips, crisps, bagels, crackers, legumes (most dried beans), cereal, porridge, oatmeal, and muesli. </p>
<p> Even whole grains and grain-like foods such as quinoa, are just other forms of starch. </p>
<p> Limit special keto or low carb products </p>
<p> Keto cookies, chocolate bars, and similar products are usually highly processed. Although they may contain less sugar and flour than their high-carb counterparts, they provide little nutritional value and may cause carb cravings. Overall, they can slow down weight loss progress. Ideally avoid or limit them and go for nutrient-dense whole foods instead. </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> Avoid foods that contain sugar, including most fruit. Also steer clear of starches, including whole grains like bread, pasta, oatmeal, and brown rice. Minimize the use of keto products and stick with minimally processed foods that are naturally low in carbs (see above). </p>
<p> Drinks </p>
<p> Drink water, coffee, tea, or the occasional glass of wine. For other ideas, choose from these: </p>
<p> Water is the number one option. Have it right out of the tap or add flavor with a slice of cucumber or a couple of berries. Drink it over ice or hot with a slice of lemon. Sparkling water and seltzers, with flavor or without, offer even more variety. </p>
<p> Coffee has no carbs. If you must have it sweetened, replace the sugar with a non-caloric sweetener. A small amount of milk or cream can be used. If you need extra calories from fat, stir in butter or coconut oil for “bulletproof coffee”. However, if weight loss stalls, cut back on the cream or fat on your coffee. </p>
<p> Tea – Black, green, Orange Pekoe, mint, or herbal – most teas are carb-free. Skip the sugar, and add a non-caloric sweetener if you need it. </p>
<p> Diet soda is good choice for some, but not for others. You might find diet soda is a helpful way to stop drinking sugary sodas. But some people find that the sweet taste of diet soda makes them hungry and increases cravings for other sugary foods. In that case, you may want to try flavored seltzers or sparkling water instead. </p>
<p> Bone broth is full of nutrients and electrolytes. Sipping a warm mug of broth fills you up and nourishes you at the same time. Homemade bone broth is delicious, but store-bought versions without added sugars or starches are good too. </p>
<p> Alcoholic drinks </p>
<p> Dry wine (red, rosé, and white) and champagne are keto-friendly in limited amounts. Wines that are typically low in carbs are merlot, pinot noir, cabernet, sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio, and chardonnay. Avoid sweet wines, such as moscato, port, ice wine, or dessert wines. </p>
<p> Distilled spirit, such as whisky, tequila, brandy, and vodka, have zero carbs, as long as they aren’t mixed with sweet sodas or juices. </p>
<p> Hard seltzers are a new, ready-to-drink option with just two grams of carbs per can. </p>
<p> Low-carb beer can be a good option. Beer usually has too many carbs for keto, but a few super low-carb beers do exist. If you love beer, it will be worth the effort to search for these. Look for a beer with less than three carbs per serving and limit your consumption. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that the more alcohol you drink, the harder it is to lose weight because your body has to burn off alcohol calories first. </p>

<p> Find out how to </p>
<p> What does the Bible say about eating food/meat that has been sacrificed to idols? </p>
<p> Answer </p>
<p> One of the struggles in the early church concerned meat which had been sacrificed to idols. Debates over what to eat might seem strange to most of us in modern society, but to the first-century believers, it was a subject of great consequence. As the apostles dealt with the issue, they gave instructions on several broader topics with application for today: </p>
<p> Unity within the church. In the early years of the church, as Gentile converts began joining Jewish believers in local fellowships, an issue arose concerning the eating of meat. Greco-Roman society was saturated with idol worship, and it was common for meat sold in the marketplace to have been consecrated as a sacrifice to false gods prior to its sale. The Jews would have nothing to do with such meat, wary of “unclean” food-handling practices and believing that to partake of consecrated meat was to give tacit approval of idol worship—kind of a “second-hand” idolatry. The Gentiles rejected the notion that such meat was tainted and held that they could eat meat sacrificed to idols without endorsing idolatry—they had not actually offered the sacrifice, after all. The matter was becoming a point of contention within the church. </p>
<p> The church in Syrian Antioch, comprised of both Jews and Gentiles, struggled with this issue (Acts 15). The Jerusalem Council settled the matter by urging Gentile converts to abstain from meat sacrificed to idols (Acts 15:29). This decision was made not to promote legalism but to keep peace within the church. Since eating meat offered to idols was a divisive issue—carrying the possibility of scandalizing fellow believers—abstinence was expedient. Compliance with the council’s directive assured that, at the next church potluck, a Jewish believer could eat the brisket he was served with confidence, knowing it had never been part of a sacrificial cow. And the Gentile believer could not be accused of participating in idol worship. </p>
<p> With its ruling, the Jerusalem Council affirmed the need for deference, or consideration for the scruples of others. The principle is one of self-denial; we should be willing to lay down our personal rights for the sake of maintaining unity in the body of Christ. Spiritual growth takes priority over personal preferences. </p>
<p> Causing a weaker brother to sin. In 1 Corinthians 8:4-13, Paul clarifies the teaching on this subject. First, he says that eating meat offered to an idol is not immoral, because “an idol is nothing at all.” An idol is an inanimate object. “Food,” he says, “does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.” The meat itself is amoral. However, there is more to consider, namely the brother with a weak conscience. Some believers, especially those with a background of idol worship, were still very sensitive concerning this issue and considered it morally wrong to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Under no circumstances, Paul says, should a believer encourage another believer to violate his conscience. To the pure, all things are pure (Titus 1:15), but to one with a weak conscience, meat taken from pagan temples was spiritually defiled. It would be better never to eat meat again than to cause a believer to sin against his conscience. </p>
<p> The “weaker” brother is not someone who simply objects to a certain practice, but one who is in danger of falling into sin. To illustrate, let’s say there are two 1st-century Christians named Demetrius and Clement. Both are former idolaters, now saved by faith in Christ. Demetrius shuns everything to do with his old way of life, including the meat sold in the marketplace, because, for him, eating such meat would constitute a return to paganism. Clement avoids the temple and refuses to participate in the pagan festivals, but he has no problem eating the meat from the market. Clement understands (correctly) that an idol has no power to corrupt good meat, and, for him, eating such meat is a non-issue. Then one day, as both men are in the marketplace, Demetrius sees Clement eating meat that was sacrificed to idols. Demetrius is horrified, but Clement laughs it off and encourages Demetrius to eat some, too. When Demetrius hesitates, Clement cuts off a piece and hands it to him. Demetrius—emboldened by Clement’s confidence—eats the meat. Biblically, both believers have sinned. Clement sinned by violating the conscience of a fellow believer. Demetrius sinned in that he essentially returned to idolatry—at least, that’s what his conscience is telling him. More importantly, Demetrius is learning how to ignore his conscience—a very dangerous thing to learn. </p>
<p> The principle here is that the conscience of a weaker Christian is more important than individual freedom. Doing something “permitted” should never hinder the spiritual health of someone else. </p>
<p> Maintaining a pure testimony. In 1 Corinthians 10:25-32, Paul again emphasizes the believer’s liberty and what should limit that liberty. If you buy meat for your own use, don’t inquire where it came from; it doesn’t really matter whether it was sacrificed to an idol or not. “The earth is the LORD’s, and everything in it” (Psalm 24:1). However, if you are invited to dinner and someone there says, “This meat was offered to idols,” then graciously refrain from eating. Since your associate obviously considers the meat to be “tainted” by the idols, do not eat it for his conscience’s sake—even though your own conscience is fine. The Christian glorifies God when he limits his freedom for the spiritual benefit of others. </p>
<p> Compromise with the world. In the letter to the church of Thyatira, Jesus rebukes them for tolerating a prophetess who “misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols” (Revelation 2:20). This is a different situation from what Paul was dealing with in Corinth. It seems that members of the church of Thyatira were partaking of the pagan “love feasts,” celebrated with gross immorality and feasting. These believers were not simply buying meat in the marketplace; they were actually attending idolatrous festivals and joining in the sin of the idolaters. (See verse 14 for a similar rebuke of the church of Pergamos.) </p>
<p> Here is a summary of the Bible’s teaching on eating meat sacrificed to idols: </p>
<p> Eating meat offered to an idol is not inherently wrong. Meat is not “defiled” because it was taken from a pagan sacrifice. God “richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment” (1 Timothy 6:17). However, some Christians consider meat offered to an idol to be defiled, and for them it is, since they must follow their conscience. Their scruples should be respected by other Christians with a stronger conscience. Love dictates that all Christians make allowances for their weaker brothers. </p>
<p> There are certain cultures today where idolatry is still practiced and where the specifics of the Bible’s teaching about sacrificial meat are still timely. For the rest of us, here are the principles which should govern our participation in the “gray areas” of life: </p>
<p> 1) Having the “right” to do something does not mean we are free to do it in every circumstance, regardless of its effects on others. </p>
<p> 2) The believer’s liberty in Christ can and should be voluntarily limited in order not to cause a weaker brother to sin by violating his conscience. Liberty is limited in love. </p>
<p> 3) Maintaining the unity of the Spirit in the bond of love may require a believer to give up his personal “right” to a thing. “How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity!” (Psalm 133:1). </p>
<p> 4) We should avoid anything that would make a weak Christian think less of his faith or that would make an unsaved person feel more at ease in his sin. </p>

We strive to only recommend products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. </p>
<p> 13 Foods That Are Still Safe to Eat After the Expiration Date </p>
<p> Wait! Don't throw out that food just yet. Just because it's days (or weeks) past a food's expiration date doesn't mean it's not still safe to eat. </p>
<p> Keep it or toss it? Every food you purchase has a shelf life. With the exception of fresh produce that isn't sold in a package, virtually all food items are marked with some type of expiration date giving the consumer an idea of when they should be eaten. </p>
<p> However, those dates—whether they're denoted by "use by," "sell by" or "best by"—are only intended to serve as guidelines and don't actually indicate food safety. Instead, they provide a general estimate regarding when a particular food is at its peak quality. That means that basically everything can be enjoyed beyond the date you see on the packaging. (Baby formula is the only exclusion. It has a federally regulated expiration date and must be consumed within a given time period.) </p>
<p> Still, as you may have guessed, the period between an expiration date of some sort and when food actually goes bad varies depending on the food itself and how it is stored. </p>
<p> We talked to a group of food safety experts and dietitians to put together a list of the foods that don't have to go to waste after they hit their expiration date. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be nice to know if your pantry items are still good to eat so you don't have to make another grocery trip. </p>
<p> Below, these pros differentiate between the various forms of expiration dates, list specific foods that are particularly shelf-stable and good to have on hand, and share tips for how you can tell if your food has gone bad. </p>
<p> What do the different dates on your food mean? </p>
<p> If you've looked at the items in your pantry or refrigerator lately, you may have noticed that some have a "use by" or "expiration" date, while others say "sell by" or "best by." While all of these terms reference the quality of your food as opposed to safety, (and are intended to serve as rough estimates) they are still important to keep in mind as you shop for food and cook at home. </p>
<p> "Food manufacturers take things like product ingredients, the length of time it takes to distribute the product, and storage temperature when determining these dates," says Sofia Norton, RD, a registered dietitian at Kiss My Keto. "But none of this is federally regulated." </p>
<p> "Use By" Dates: "This date is put on by the food manufacturer as the last date recommended for the use of the product while at peak quality. Again, eating it after the 'use by' date will not make you sick," says Toby Amidor, MS, RD, CDN, FAND and the author of The Create-Your-Plate Diabetes Cookbook. "It's a quality issue not a food safety issue." </p>
<p> "Expiration" Dates: "The "expiration" date is aimed at consumers and is the last date the product can be considered fresh. After that, it's quality goes south and it may soon go bad," says Norton. "The expiration date does not mean the product is not safe to consume, but that can happen soon after this date. Think of these as rough guides." </p>
<p> "Sell By" Dates: "This date tells the store how long to display the food product. You can still eat the food after the 'sell by' date has passed; however, the quality of the item (such as freshness, taste, and consistency) may not be as good as before that date," says Amidor. "If you eat the food after the 'sell by' date, the nutritional quality of the food can also be diminished (especially after a few months or even years). If you eat the food after the "sell by" date, you will not get sick. It is not an indicator of food safety." </p>
<p> "Best By" Dates: "This date, again, refers to the quality, not safety, of the food," Amidor says. "The date is recommended by the food manufacturer for the best flavor and quality." </p>
<p> An important thing to keep in mind is that each of these dates applies to items that have been stored properly. "Keep in mind that if a food item was/is not properly handled even before the labeled dates, it still may have a chance of being contaminated," says Amanda A. Kostro Miller, RD, LDN, who serves on the advisory board for Fitter Living. </p>
<p> "For example, if you do not properly refrigerate milk within two hours of getting it at the store, then even the freshest milk can go bad and be unsafe to consume. It is important that we store, cook, serve and put away food items in a safe manner to avoid contamination and foodborne illness." </p>
<p> The types of foods that are more or less likely to go bad after their expiration date </p>
<p> When it comes to consuming food after its "best by," "sell by" or any other date, there really are no hard-and-fast rules to follow. </p>
<p> However, there are some general factors that are important to note. "The main question you should ask yourself when determining the shelf life of a food item is how susceptible it is to bacterial growth. In general, bacteria need three things to grow: food, moisture, and warmth," says Janilyn Hutchings, a certified food safety professional at State Food Safety. "When a food item has a high number of carbs or protein and contains moisture, it's more vulnerable to bacterial growth." </p>
<p> She says, "That means that dairy, eggs, cooked grains, cut greens, fruits, and other vegetables, many opened condiments, meat and poultry, and fish are all more susceptible to bacterial growth than other types of food. We call those kinds of foods 'perishable foods.'" </p>
<p> Uncooked grains, on the other hand, typically don't contain enough moisture to be considered perishable, while canned foods are sealed to keep bacteria out. </p>
<p> "Refrigerator temperatures don't completely stop bacteria from growing, they just slow its growth. In general, perishable foods will survive in your fridge for about seven days," Hutchings says. "Opened condiments are an exception to the rule because they're typically more acidic." </p>
<p> The freezer, Hutchings notes, is a slightly different story. "Freezer temperatures do stop bacteria from growing and food stored in the freezer is technically safe to eat indefinitely," she says. "The bigger question about frozen food is not if it's safe, but whether it still tastes good. The longer food stays frozen, the more its quality tends to go downhill." </p>
<p> What foods that are still good after their expiration date? </p>
<p> Below is a list of specific foods you can stock up on that will remain edible well past their "sell by" dates. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Eggs: 3-4 weeks past expiration date </p>
<p> "Like most animal foods, eggs are perishable, which means they can go bad quickly," Norton says. "With proper handling, you can extend their shelf-life by a couple of days. Kept in the fridge at 40 degrees F, they can be safe to consume for four to five weeks after packaging." </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Bread: 5-7 days past expiration date </p>
<p> "Bread can last around five to seven days past its expiry date," says Megan Wong, RD, a registered dietitian working with AlgaeCal. "But be on the lookout for mold, especially if stored in a moist environment. It's best to store bread in a cool, dry place. And if you want to extend its shelf life, store bread in the freezer and it'll keep for three to six months. It will lose some freshness and flavor of course, but it will be safe to eat." </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Canned corn: 1-2 years past expiration date </p>
<p> "Canned food is among the least perishable out there. Canned corn, for example, often has a best-by date of three to five years slapped on the label. But you can eat it even years after that," says Norton. "Canning kills microorganisms that cause food to spoil in the first place. Besides that, canned foods are vacuum-sealed, which means there's no oxygen to make the food brown and degrade." </p>
<p> Other unopened canned goods that made the cut? Beans, fruit, mushrooms, pasta sauce, chicken, and chili, according to Hutchings. "The longer the food has expired, the more likely its flavor will be affected, but it should still be safe," she says. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Cereal and granola: 1-3 weeks past expiration date </p>
<p> Like pasta, these dry processed foods don't contain much, if any, moisture, which contributes to their stability, Hutchings points out. The same goes for dried fruit, crackers, and chips. </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Dry ingredients: 1-2 months past expiration date </p>
<p> This includes items such as white flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and sugar. "Since there is no moisture in dry ingredients, they're less susceptible to bacterial growth in general," Hutchings says. "Salt in particular never really goes bad because it doesn't have the means to support bacterial growth and it's often used as a preservative since it's really good at preventing that growth. Don't eat any dry ingredients that have an unnatural smell or signs of a pest infestation." </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> Hard cheese: weeks after expiration date </p>
<p> Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, are another safe bet even if they begin to show some signs of aging over time. "Once these are past their best-by date, they may start to form a white or blue-green mold on the surface. Simply scrape off these molds or even cut the parts affected and your hard cheese is again safe to consume," says Norton. "Hard cheeses have a low moisture content, which makes it harder for bacteria to grow as most bacteria prefer moist environments." </p>
<p> Milk: 1 week past expiration date </p>
<p> "Dairy milk can last up to a week past its expiry date," says Wong. "If you're unsure, give it a whiff to see if it's gone sour." </p>
<p> 8 </p>
<p> Nuts: weeks to months after expiration date </p>
<p> Though most nuts are fairly stable because they lack an abundance of moisture, Hutchings notes that the satiating foods are typically high in fat, which means they might need a little extra inspection if they've been idling in your pantry for an extended period of time beyond the sell by date. "Don't eat any dry processed foods that have a grassy or paint-like odor, a dark or oily appearance, or water damage to the packaging," she says. </p>
<p> 9 </p>
<p> Pasta: 2 years past expiration date </p>
<p> "Pasta is a dry product, which is why it doesn't spoil easily. The same holds for whole-grain pasta, as the dryness offsets rancidity," Norton says. "This is why you can safely use it past its due date, but the quality may suffer." Per Hutchings, the same goes for uncooked rice, as well as uncooked oats and oatmeal. </p>
<p> 10 </p>
<p> Root vegetables: several weeks </p>
<p> This includes foods like beets, carrots and parsnips. "Many root crops can last for several weeks with little effect on their taste," says Jennifer Kaplan, an Instructor at the Culinary Institute of America. "In general, the fresher the food and the more water and oil content it contains, the quicker it will spoil. That's because moisture breeds microorganisms and oils contain fats that oxidize when exposed to heat, light and air that can lead to rancidity." </p>
<p> 11 </p>
<p> Yogurt: 3 weeks past expiration </p>
<p> Though yogurt, which is typically dairy-based, isn't often thought of as a food that is particularly shelf-stable, it too has a lifespan beyond its expiration date. According to Norton, unopened yogurt is safe to eat for up to three weeks past its expiration date. "Yogurt is made by introducing probiotics and lactic acid bacteria, which help keep bad bacteria at bay," she says. "You may notice that your yogurt has whey that's separated from the curd—this is normal and nothing to be worried about." </p>
<p> 12 </p>
<p> Honey: indefinitely after expiration date </p>
<p> Honey is one of the foods that never go bad. It has such a long shelf life because it's a low-moisture form of sugar, which prevents the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms that typically make food go bad can't thrive in that dry of an environment. Plus, honey is acidic. The high acidity means it will kill off any other bacteria trying to survive in honey. So as long as your honey is properly sealed and stored in a dry place, it should last forever. </p>
<p> 13 </p>
<p> Marinara Sauce: 1-4 weeks past expiration date </p>
<p> Like honey, marinara sauce is extremely acidic. This acidity helps to protect the tomato sauce from harboring spoiling bacteria. This extends the length of your marinara sauce for months after its expiration date and even for weeks after you open a jar. </p>
<p> How do you know if food has gone bad? </p>
<p> As we've established, most foods can be safely consumed for varying periods of time after their sell-by dates, however, that doesn't mean that the majority of foods won't go bad eventually. </p>
<p> "When in doubt, use your senses of sight, feel, and smell to check if food has gone bad. If it smells off, feels off, and looks off, chances are it is," says Norton. "For example, spoiled milk will have an unpleasantly sour or even putrid smell. Meat that has a pungent, ammonia-type smell, that's developing a green hue and is slimy is also bad." </p>
<p> "Look for discoloration in fruits and veggies or if they're forming mold," she says. </p>
<p> While canned goods typically fare better than most, there are still things consumers should look out for. "Don't eat food if the can is dented or bulging, if the lid or seal are broken, if there are streaks of dried food originating from the top of the can/jar, or if the contents of the can/jar are an unnatural color, smell unusual, contain foamy liquid or cotton-like mold (could be white, black, blue, or green) on the top of the food surface and the bottom of the lid," says Hutchings. </p>
<p> "Foods tend to display very apparent signs of spoilage: mold, foul odor, discoloration, and literal breakdown of structural integrity," says Devon Golem PhD, RD. "A best practice is to mark the date of opening any product and then refer to FDA information such as the FoodKeeper app to decide whether or not to discard a food product. Food waste due to ambiguous date-labeling is a big problem in the U.S. Efforts are being made to reduce this food waste, but until then, consumers need to use their best judgment and the tools available to them." </p>

<p> Foods to Avoid When You Have Diarrhea </p>
<p> Barbara Bolen, PhD, is a licensed clinical psychologist and health coach. She has written multiple books focused on living with irritable bowel syndrome. </p>
<p> Jay Yepuri, MD, MS, is board-certified in gastroenterology. He is a partner with Digestive Health Associates of Texas and a medical director at Texas Health Harris Methodist HEB Hospital. </p>
<p> It is important to know what to eat for diarrhea. But it is just as important to know what not to eat when you have diarrhea. The last thing you would want to do is to make matters worse by eating foods that could potentially aggravate your stomach or cause you to have even more intestinal spasms. Doing so could lead to more misery. </p>
<p> Dairy Products </p>
<p> The first group of foods you will want to avoid are those made from milk. Even if you don’t suffer from lactose intolerance, it might be a good idea to avoid dairy products for a while after suffering from a bout of diarrhea.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Diarrhea can cause a lessening of the amount of the enzyme lactase. Lactase is needed in order for the body to digest lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. If this “milk sugar” goes undigested, it can result in further symptoms of gas, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea. </p>
<p> Cream </p>
<p> Cheese </p>
<p> Yogurt is a better choice. The probiotics in yogurt may help your body to heal. Choose plain yogurt and skip those with excess added sugar. </p>
<p> Fatty Foods </p>
<p> Foods with high-fat content can speed up intestinal contractions and cause a reaction to a system that is already sensitized, almost guaranteeing further trips to the john.﻿﻿ Thus you will want to avoid foods like: </p>
<p> Fatty cuts of meat </p>
<p> Foods covered in gravy </p>
<p> Better choices include lean protein, like white meat chicken or turkey, or broth-based soups. </p>
<p> Sugar-Free Foods </p>
<p> Some artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes can have a laxative effect, as well as contribute to gas and bloating.﻿﻿ So until you are feeling better, it is best to avoid: </p>
<p> Diet soda </p>
<p> Sugar-free candy </p>
<p> Sugar-free gum </p>
<p> Sugar substitute packets for coffee and tea </p>
<p> Gas-Producing Foods </p>
<p> Certain foods have a well-documented reputation for increasing intestinal gas which could contribute to further diarrhea. Thus you will want to avoid gassy foods and choose non-gassy foods until you feel that your stomach has really settled down.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Vegetables and Legumes </p>
<p> Here are some examples of the gassiest vegetables and legumes. You may want to skip these until you feel better: </p>
<p> Broccoli </p>
<p> Cabbage </p>
<p> Cauliflower </p>
<p> Some better choices include leafy greens like spinach, green beans, and zucchini. </p>
<p> Fruits </p>
<p> Here are some examples of some of the gassiest fruits. Again, you may want to skip these until things settle down: </p>
<p> Peaches </p>
<p> Pears </p>
<p> Plums </p>
<p> Dried fruits (apricots, prunes, raisins) </p>
<p> If you think your system is up to eating some fruit, you may want to try blueberries, strawberries, honeydew or cantaloupe melon, and/or pineapple. </p>
<p> Alcohol, Caffeine, and Carbonated Beverages </p>
<p> For healthy individuals, beverages containing alcohol, caffeine, and carbonation do not generally cause diarrhea. However, each has the potential to be a GI irritant, and thus are probably best avoided until your system returns to normal.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Do not reach for flat soda either. Although your grandmother may have made that recommendation, the components in soda may actually make things worse. </p>
<p> A better choice would be an oral rehydration solution, like Pedialyte, or just plain water. When you have diarrhea, it is important to replenish fluids lost from those repeated bowel movements, so drink up.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Unsafe Foods </p>
<p> Whether you have diarrhea or not, you should always make sure that you only eat food that has been safely washed, prepared and stored. Foods that are not safely prepared and stored put you at risk for a serious gastrointestinal illness.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Always observe good food hygiene: </p>
<p> Wash your hands thoroughly before preparing or eating any food. </p>
<p> Thoroughly wash all raw fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p> Clean food preparation surfaces with hot soapy water before and after use. </p>
<p> Cook all foods to an internal temperature of 160 F. </p>
<p> Refrigerate or freeze leftovers immediately after eating. </p>
<p> High-FODMAP Foods </p>
<p> If your diarrhea is something that you deal with a lot because you have diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), you may want to avoid foods that are high in FODMAPs when you are experiencing an active flare. </p>
<p> FODMAPs are carbohydrates found in many common foods that have been shown to trigger symptoms in people who have IBS.﻿﻿ You may even want to give the low-FODMAP diet a try to see if that brings your symptoms under control. </p>

<p> Foods to Eat When You Are Constipated </p>
<p> Barbara Bolen, PhD, is a licensed clinical psychologist and health coach. She has written multiple books focused on living with irritable bowel syndrome. </p>
<p> Robert Burakoff, MD, MPH, is board-certified in gastroentrology. He is the vice chair for ambulatory services for the department of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. </p>
<p> When you are experiencing constipation, you certainly want to eat foods that will get your system moving. The key element in foods that are best for constipation is fiber, and you will find that in foods that come from plants.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Best Foods to Eat When Constipated </p>
<p> Use this quick pick list of high-fiber foods, and then explore more in-depth about why these foods will help your constipation. You will also find precautions for those who may be sensitive to some of the foods on the list. </p>
<p> Fruit: Berries, peaches, apricots, plums, raisins, rhubarb, and prunes are some of the best high-fiber fruits. For a fiber boost, eat the peel as well. </p>
<p> Whole Grains: Steer away from white flour and white rice and enjoy whole grains instead, which provide more fiber. Whole grains include oats, brown rice, whole wheat, quinoa, barley, and rye. </p>
<p> Vegetables: Whether you're eating the leaves, stalks, or roots, you'll get fiber from vegetables, including what is in potato skins. </p>
<p> Nuts: Walnuts and almonds will also add fiber to your diet. </p>
<p> Seeds: Several kinds of seeds are excellent sources of fiber. You can add them to your smoothies or sprinkle them on yogurt or salads. Chia, ground flaxseeds, and psyllium are some of the most touted. </p>
<p> Beans and Legumes (with caution): Legumes such as chickpeas, soybeans, lentils, navy beans, and kidney beans are good sources of fiber. However, they have a well-earned reputation for being gassy. If you have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), beans and legumes are on the list of high FODMAP foods that may exacerbate IBS symptoms.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Hot Tea: An herbal tea made with anise or fennel might be a soothing way to ease your constipation. </p>
<p> Why Fiber Helps When You Have Constipation </p>
<p> The best thing you can do to ease constipation is to slowly increase your intake of dietary fiber.﻿﻿ Fiber is the part of plant material that you cannot digest. </p>
<p> Fiber is helpful for constipation because it serves to both add bulk and softness to the stool. </p>
<p> Soluble fiber absorbs water and binds with fatty acids, forming a gel-like substance that keeps stools soft. </p>
<p> Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water, thus providing bulk and moisture to the stool. </p>
<p> Both types of fiber are good for constipation. Since both insoluble and soluble fibers are found in all plant foods, it is not necessary to try to remember which foods are a good source of which type of fiber.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> However, too much fiber too soon can be hard on your system and may add to symptoms of gas and bloating. Therefore, increase your intake of fruits and vegetables slowly. For treating constipation, it is recommended that you increase your fiber intake to 20 to 25 grams per day.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> If you have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) you may find that your system is better able to handle foods with soluble fiber, as insoluble fiber may trigger your symptoms.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> FODMAPs and Gassy Foods </p>
<p> If you have IBS, you may want to avoid foods that are high in short-chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs), even if they are good for other people who have constipation. FODMAPs are carbohydrates found in ordinary foods that have been found to exacerbate IBS symptoms.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Although eating more fruits and vegetables can help to ease your constipation, some of them have a gassy reputation. It may be a good idea to choose foods that are less likely to give you gas until your system is working more readily. Once your acute constipation has passed, you can widen your choice of produce. </p>
<p> Best Fruits for Constipation </p>
<p> Fruits are a great option for easing constipation.﻿﻿ Most are an excellent source of dietary fiber, along with providing you with a whole host of other nutritional benefits. Although there is no hard science on the matter, you may find that your body responds better to fruit that has been cooked or dried, as opposed to raw. </p>
<p> Here are some fruits that are thought to be helpful in easing constipation. </p>
<p> Dried Options </p>
<p> Figs </p>
<p> Prunes </p>
<p> Best Vegetables for Constipation </p>
<p> Eating lots of vegetables, including green leafy vegetables, is one of the best strategies for keeping your bowels moving regularly.﻿﻿ In addition to getting that healthy dose of fiber, vegetables also provide a whole range of nutrients that are good for your digestive and overall health. </p>
<p> As is the case with fruits, you may find that your body responds in a more comfortable way to cooked rather than raw vegetables. Enjoy vegetable soup made with a variety of high-fiber vegetables. </p>
<p> The following vegetables are thought to be beneficial for easing constipation. </p>
<p> Eat Your Greens </p>
<p> Kale </p>
<p> Lettuce </p>
<p> Fill Your Plate With Vegetables </p>
<p> Whole Grains and Constipation </p>
<p> Switching from refined grains such as white flour and white rice to whole grains is thought by many to make a difference in terms of resolving constipation issues.﻿﻿ Here are some good whole grain choices. </p>
<p> Note: If you suffer from chronic constipation, you may want to try an elimination diet of all grains to assess any effect on your symptoms.﻿﻿ Check with your doctor first and be sure to load up on fiber from all of the other sources listed in these slides. </p>
<p> Best Teas for Constipation </p>
<p> One way to ease constipation is to reach for a soothing cup of tea. Hot liquids may help to prompt your system to action.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> A tea made with herbs with laxatives effects is ideal. </p>
<p> The two best teas for constipation are: </p>
<p> Anise tea: This licorice-tasting tea is thought to have both laxative and antispasmodic effects. </p>
<p> Fennel tea: Also licorice-tasting, fennel tea is thought to speed up intestinal contractions, as well as act as a laxative and an antispasmodic. </p>
<p> Best Nuts for Constipation </p>
<p> Nuts are a good source of fiber and omega fatty acids.﻿﻿ Here are some good choices to reach for when you are constipated: </p>
<p> Almonds </p>
<p> Brazil nuts </p>
<p> Pecans </p>
<p> Walnuts </p>
<p> Best Seeds for Constipation </p>
<p> There are a few different types of seeds that are thought to be particularly helpful in easing constipation.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Chia seeds: These little seeds are a good source of dietary fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. Sprinkle them on salads or add them to smoothies. </p>
<p> Fennel seeds: Chewing on fennel seeds is thought to help to ease gas and bloating, along with easing constipation. </p>
<p> Flaxseed: These pleasant little nutty-flavored seeds need to be ground to benefit from their fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. Can be used in baking or added to smoothies. </p>
<p> Psyllium: There is a lot of research support for the use of psyllium as a way to ease constipation which earns it its designation as a bulk laxative. </p>
<p> Best Snacks for Constipation </p>
<p> Fruit: Apples and pears are quite portable. </p>
<p> Granola: Make your own granola to reduce added sugar and to ensure that you are adding grains, seeds, and nuts that you can tolerate. </p>
<p> Hummus: This fiber-rich snack is very portable and you can enjoy it with raw vegetable sticks such as carrots or celery. </p>
<p> Nuts: Brazil nuts, pecans, and walnuts are generally well-tolerated by all. </p>
<p> Trail mix: Make your own to ensure that you are eating foods that are suited for you. You can add some nuts, seeds, dark chocolate and dried fruit (if tolerated). </p>
<p> Vegetables: Carrots and celery are classic nibbles. </p>
<p> Drink Plenty of Water </p>
<p> Every cell in your body needs water to function to its best ability. If you don't drink enough water, your body will compensate by pulling water out of your intestines. This may result in hard stools that contribute to constipation.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Drink water throughout your day. You will know that you are drinking enough if your urine is clear. </p>
<p> Frequently Asked Questions </p>
<p> What causes constipation? </p>
<p> Constipation is ultimately caused by stools that move too slowly through the digestive tract. There are many reasons for this, some of the most common of which include: </p>
<p> What foods help relieve constipation? </p>
<p> High-fiber foods including vegetables, fruits, dried fruits, beans, whole grains, nuts, and seeds can not only help relieve constipation but keep you regular if you are prone to chronic constipation. It is also important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> What foods should you avoid if constipated? </p>
<p> Avoid low-fiber foods that are harder to digest, including red meats, dairy products, processed foods, and anything made with refined flour (like white bread). You should also steer clear of fried foods.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> What other ways can you treat constipation? </p>
<p> In addition to diet, exercise can help stimulate the bowels and move stools faster through the digestive tract.﻿﻿ Over-the-counter fiber supplements can also help.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> While laxatives and stool softeners can definitely help ease constipation symptoms, they should never be used for longer than two weeks.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> A Word From Verywell </p>
<p> When you have constipation, remember that foods that come from plants are your best choices to help get things moving. Be sure to drink four to six glasses of liquids per day and to be physically active as well.﻿﻿ </p>

<p> Foods to eat before and after yoga </p>
<p> by Darlene (PEI) </p>
<p> Fruits : Best Food For Yoga </p>
<p> I am verily new to yoga and find eating chicken, soup or bread before yoga makes me feel terrible, please help. I want to know of foods that do not make me tired or in a slump...Darlene </p>
<p> Answer </p>
<p> Hello Darlene.. Here are my suggestions. </p>
<p> Eating Before Yoga Eating before and after yoga is a frequently asked question by most yoga practitioners. Yoga is not like any other exercise and is best done on an empty stomach. You will enjoy doing yoga if your stomach is empty. There should be interval of at least 3 hours between your last meal and yoga practice. </p>
<p> In three hours time, body is able to digest most of the food resulting in empty stomach required for yoga. In these 3 hours prior to yoga session do not eat anything, exception can be lime juice or fruits preferably. A cup of coffee or half a glass of milk will also do in case you feel better that way. In case you feel too hungry, eat some fruits at least 45 minutes to one hour before your yoga class. If you want to eat bread, heavy snacks or chicken, eat it well before your yoga class. </p>
<p> Eating before yoga will depend on how fast the foods get digested in the stomach. Water will take 15-20 minutes, fruits 30 to 40 minutes, light meals may take 2 hours, heavy meal high on fat content and spices may take three hours or more to get digested. </p>
<p> Best bet is to eat a fruit 45 minutes before yoga. If doing yoga in the morning, drink a cup of tea, warm lime juice with honey or half a glass of warm milk. So there are lot of choices here. </p>
<p> Before going to yoga class, be cheerful, be contented. If you need to eat before yoga class, you must. Eat well before going for yoga class. </p>
<p> Why not to eat before Yoga? During the yoga asanas especially forward and reverse bending poses, there is pressure on abdominal organs which may push the food upwards resulting in feeling of great discomfort. In addition, </p>
<p> if you do yoga while digestive processes are on, most of the blood circulation will be diverted to digestive tract. </p>
<p> What to Eat? If you have started doing yoga, you can not modify your eating habits in a day. I suggest do not make sudden changes to your diet but gradually move towards yogic way of eating. This will keep you healthy and save tons of money on junk food. As you become more self aware with yoga practice, you will be able to exercise more control over your eating. Your need for food also reduces as well as better restraint to avoid binge eating. Try to understand the basic tenets of yogic diet. </p>
<p> Lay more stress on easily digestible foods like raw, whole grain and organic foods. </p>
<p> Your food must be sattvik. </p>
<p> Eat for nutrition and not for taste. </p>
<p> Fresh fruits and some nuts taken daily can provide you required energy. </p>
<p> Gradually decrease the consumption of meat products. </p>
<p> Eat and drink in moderation. </p>
<p> Avoid spicy food. </p>
<p> Doing Yoga in the Morning </p>
<p> On waking up drink 2-3 glasses of water. Take a glass of fresh lime juice in lukewarm water along with a spoon of honey. Clear your bowels before doing yoga. </p>
<p> This is all what you need before a yoga practice. Thereafter you can enjoy your yoga practice on empty stomach. People who are used to drinking bed tea may take half a cup of tea but gradually try to avoid taking tea before yoga practice. </p>
<p> Do not eat 30 minutes after the class. After half an hour of your yoga practice drink a glass of warm milk or fruit juice. </p>
<p> Doing Yoga in the Evening </p>
<p> Do not eat 3 hours prior to your yoga practice. </p>
<p> In the lunch, eat easily digestible foods like soups,sprouts, fruits and vegetables. Avoid fried, meat and heavy grain foods. </p>
<p> Do not eat anything for at least 30 minute after the yoga class </p>
<p> Comments for Foods to eat before and after yoga </p>
<p> Food to consume before yoga practice by: Anonymous Hello. </p>
<p> Can I have a glass of ragi malt/ finger millet drink one hour before I head to yoga practice? I am a housewife and I get to practice yoga only 3 hours after I get up. So, I mostly feel tired by the time I head to practice. Also, I was suggested by few people to do yoga on empty stomach for good benefits. Does empty stomach mean I should avoid any kind of meals or should I avoid taking anything as the finger millet drink I have mentioned also? Your answer would help me gain better clarification on this subject. Thank You </p>
<p> Editors Reply You may take any fruit or fresh fruit/ vegetable juice just after getting up in the morning so that it can get digested before you do yoga after 3 hours. Do not take any processed drink or cereal. </p>
<p> Hope it helps Daljit </p>

<p> Help to lose weight and questions about yoga by: Anonymous hello, I am 23 yrs old girl. I have gained 16kg in just one year as i was studying abroad and relied on fast food. However, I have now joined the gym which offers evening yoga fit classes twice a week. However, I would like to start surya namaskar on a daily basis in the morning together with pranayam and bit of meditation. I've read that these should be done on an empty stomach and empty bowel. However, I find it difficult to empty bowel in the morning. Even if i drink warm lemon water on an empty stomach I don;t empty bowel immediately, this happens either around 10am or afternoon. I think i have a slow digestive system. How do I treat this problem? </p>
<p> I am now planning to start to eat a balanced meal. Kindly advise if this is correct: On empty stomach on waking up immediately: 1lt water OR 1 glass warm lemon water </p>

<p> Surya namaskara and water, breakfast by: Raju I usually have 1 1/2 hr of time between the time I get up in the morning and leave for office. Could you guide me on the sequence I should follow? I do Surya-namaskaras 11 sets, and I would like to drink 3 glasses of water if possible. Currently I'm doing it this way: Get up, drink 3 glasses of water 5 minutes bowel movement, and take shower - 20 minutes do surya-namaskaras 11 sets - 15 minutes dress-up and get ready - 15 minutes breakfast - 15 minutes leave from home - 5 minutes </p>
<p> Please guide me with proper sequence. </p>
<p> Editors Note You need to do warm up before suryanamaskar. After suryanamaskar do shavasana for 2 minutes. Thereafter you may add few asanas and pranayama. </p>

<p> problem by: Deepti Hey! I was following all these rules since last one month, like drinking lime water with honey before my yoga class but since I have a tight schedule i would run for yoga classes just after ten minutes. Then I would do yoga for half an hour including meditation, om, bharamri, bhastrika and then at least 10 rounds of sun salutation. Everything was fine but since last one week, I thought to increase the rounds. I did 15 rounds for two and three days and now abruptly I started feeling lazy, weak and energyless. I cant wake up early for yoga, I feel tired. Even if I give it a try I feel pain in my body. Tell me what wrong I have done? I am staying away from all kinds of junk food, parties and take my naps on time. </p>
<p> Editors Note Maybe you are too tired with your daily schedule and then did yoga more than your body's natural capacity. Low energy may be due to lack of rest, sleep or proper rest. </p>
<p> Take rest for few days and hope you will be ok. You may contact me with more details if this doesn't work out for you. </p>

<p> Suryanamaskar by: Anonymous I generally take detox water(mixture of turmeric, ginger, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg powder) soon after waking up around 6:30/7:00 A.M and wait for one hour to start suryanamaskar but by the time I finish 10/12 suryanamaskar, I feel hungry and gas starts building up and I couldn't do the rest of the trikonasana etc properly. </p>
<p> Because of frequently skipping meals, untimely unhealthy eating habits of years I am having this gas, indigestion problem almost all the time. But I don't want to have general medicine but with yoga and healthy eating I want to bring my life to track. </p>
<p> Please suggest the timing for yoga and can I do suryanamaskar soon after waking up and then drink the water followed by other yogas. Thanks in advance. </p>

As I always catch cold, have difficulty in breathing which also add on to long sleepless nights. Please suggest. </p>

Before sleeping, you may practice rhythmic breathing for 5 minutes and yoga nidra for 5-10 minutes and continue if it helps. If you do kapalabhati and anulom vilom you may have difficulty sleeping due to increased energy levels. For cold, there can be many reasons and cannot comment based on limited information. </p>

<p> Enjoy reading your tips by: Anonymous I'm in my 60's and recently began yoga with a great teacher. I go once a week for an hour. While some positions are challenging, I am enjoying trying to learn and benefit by taking this class. Is it normal to feel a bit achy a day later? A little nauseated? </p>
<p> Also, a few of us have had a glass of wine and appetizer right after class has ended. Is this ok? Could this contribute to above descriptions of feeling a little off? Your advice on both questions is appreciated. Thank you. </p>

<p> Weight loss by: Neha Namaste! </p>
<p> I am having 63 kg weight and my height is 5'1". I am new to yoga. I am practicing yoga daily since two weeks. I do pranayam,some asnas,and sometimes 18 to 21 times surya namaskar for 50 min. Then I eat apple, and after 4 hours I take meal, 4 to 5 chapatis and sometimes dal and sometimes green vegetables. In a day time I sleep for two hours. I do not eat anything for the whole day and take my dinner at 9 p.m. (chapatis and vegetables). I am fond of rice and tea, but I stopped eating rice and taking tea. Should I change my diet plan, or sleeping habit in day time. If I continue with the same routine can I lose my weight. Or how much time it will take to reduce atleast 10 kg. </p>
<p> Editors Note It is suggested that you lose 10 Kg of weight gradually at a rate of approximately 2-2.5 Kg per month. If you feel hungry, you can eat small helping of oats or cornflakes after you eat your apple (breakfast). In lunch, reduce the number of chapatis, but have more of salads and vegetables. In the evening, eat some fruit, nuts or another healthy snack. Eat a light dinner say one chapatti with vegetables or lentils and finish it before 8 P.M. In addition to yoga, burn more calories by walking or jogging for half hour to one hour. </p>

<p> Editors Note Before yoga practice it is ideal to have any herbal tea or fresh fruit juices. Since you have one hour of time before yoga, you can eat some fruit. To reduce weight you need to do yoga for one hour comprising of more yoga asanas and at least 12 or more suryanamaskars, pranayama and adequate rest in shavasana. You can take poha or upma half an hour after yoga. Eating dinner before 7 P.M will be very beneficial. Please let me know if you have any further query. You can read more here How to reduce weight?

<p> avoiding food before class by: DE JUR For me eating before yoga makes me feel miserable, because I feel like I need to throw up. It is a sensation vs a real need, but the feeling is a major distraction. It is very uncomfortable to do any forward folding poses and asanas on my stomach. I leave at least 3 hours from the last meal until class time. I also believe the body is doing too many things: trying to digest the food, heating up from the asanas, twisting, bending, stretching. Namaste'. De Jur </p>

<p> Oat meal by: Anonymous I am a beginner in yoga. I try to do yoga on empty stomach everyday. I drink loads of water though I feel so tried and I get reluctant to do yoga. I am a food lover always so I hate doing yoga without eating anything in the morning. I am planning to have some oatmeal in the morning. So could you please tell me how long I should wait to start yoga after having oatmeal? </p>
<p> Editors Note It is better to drink enough water in summers to stay hydrated. After oatmeal you have to wait 3 hours for doing yoga. Yoga is best done on empty stomach. Therefore, you can drink lime juice with honey or fresh fruit juice and do yoga after 30 minutes. </p>

<p> Drinking of Water by: Purnanandam Sana I am waking up at 04:45 A.M and drink one liter cold water. After taking bath I start yoga (Kapalabhati pranayama and asanas) at 06:00 A.M and concluding at 07:00 A.M. At 07:05 A.M I take half liter water. In evening, I do yoga (asanas and anuloma viloma pranayama) from 06:00 P.M to 06:30 P.M. </p>
<p> Can you guide me, Sir whether I am on the correct path? </p>
<p> Editors Note 1. There is no harm in drinking one liter water around 75 minutes before doing yoga. You may continue with the practice if you do not face any problem in doing yoga. However, drinking of too much water is also not advisable. 2. Drinking of half liter water 5 minutes after yoga practice is not advisable. If you have strong urge to drink any liquid after yoga, drink a cup of any herbal tea or milk at least 15 to 20 minutes after yoga. 3. To optimise your practice, you may do asanas in the morning and pranayama in the evening. </p>

<p> Yoga & Gym Is it - Good Combination? by: Anonymous First of all thank you very much for this page, it proves to be very informative. I recently got inspired to do suryanamaskaram and planning to start from tomorrow and I have been doing research to do everything right from the time I begin, so that I get good results. I have two quick queries. </p>
<p> 1) Normally my bowel movements happen only after a cup of coffee, if this is the case, is it ok to start yoga after a cup of coffee? As I see it is beneficial to do yoga after bowel movements and empty stomach? </p>
<p> 2) I am a regular at the gym in the evenings, for close to 1 to 1.5 hours. I do the normal cardio routines and weight training and I plan to do at least of 20 mins yoga in the morning before I leave for work. I would like to know, if my evening routine would affect Yoga performance in any way or vice-versa? </p>
<p> Kindly advise, Regards, Nirupama </p>
<p> Editors Note </p>
<p> Hello Nirupama </p>
<p> 1. You may continue to drink coffee, but try to take black coffee and without sugar if possible. As you continue with yoga practice, after some days you may not require to drink coffee to clear the bowels. </p>
<p> 2. You can complement your evening cardio training with 20-30 minutes of yoga in the morning. Yoga practice in the morning will definitely improve your energy level throughout the day.Good Luck. </p>

<p> 1. You should evaluate the following: ~ Is there is any major change in your eating style? If you are eating healthy, any increase in the portions? Finally the number of calories intake matters whether it is healthy or junk food. ~ Is there any change in your lifestyle for example change from an active lifestyle to sedentary lifestyle. 2. You can start doing half an hour to one hour walk daily. 3. Still if you are gaining weight, get a medical checkup to ensure there is no harmonal imbalance. </p>

<p> Bloating, constipation and gas by: Anonymous Hi! I have been practicing yoga for quite some time now for health reasons mostly. I've been constipated for quite a long time too, along with bloating and gas whenever I do asanas. My daily routine changes almost every month in the past few months which resulted to me being very lax about what i eat..Too much sugar and all that and irregular meals..I honestly don't know if I should avoid certain types of food, stick to a daily routine..I mean, my tummy gets really really bloated and I seriously don't know how to start.would really appreciate your suggestions. thank you! </p>
<p> Editors Note </p>
<p> Yoga practice should not lead to constipation, bloating or gas. In your case, three things need to be taken care of; health of your digestive system, type of food you eat and your eating patterns. </p>
<p> Your first aim should be to improve working of your digestive system and avoid constipation. In general, increase of plant based vegetarian diet can be helpful. </p>

<p> Jogging and Yoga by: Anonymous I value your suggestions. I am 22 years of age with height 5 feet 3 inches. Now my weight is 68 Kg. I took yoga training in Feb 2014. I practiced till May 14, after that I stopped practice. My weight increased by 6 kg by September 14. I agree that I did not follow diet exercise. I am thinking of doing yoga from 4:30 A.M to 5:30 A.M. Then I want to do jogging for half an hour or only yoga is sufficient. Because I want to reduce 10 kg but gradually. </p>
<p> Editors Note You may aim for gradual weight loss of 1.5 kg per month. I suggest you do jogging for half an hour, take 15 minutes rest and then do yoga for one hour. Once your weight loss target is achieved and fitness is improved, you can do only yoga asanas and pranayama for one and half hours, it will be sufficient exercise. </p>

<p> Eat balanced diet. Eat enough fiber, fruits and vegetables. Avoid sugar and all processed, packaged and frozen foods. Stay relaxed at all times. Do yoga with proper technique. Take adequate sleep. </p>

<p> As there is a gap of 3 hours between your yoga practice and breakfast, there is nothing wrong in doing breakfast. Just eat easily digestible food and avoid any fried food or fats so that the breakfast is digested before yoga. If you eat a very heavy breakfast your body will give you indications. </p>

Hope that explain on why I am not getting enough rest. </p>

<p> Secondly, I was wondering if you can tell me how I can learn yoga from you! I am in Canada. </p>
<p> And lastly, I had a question about one of my friend's daughter who is about 26 years old, unmarried, and has been getting severe stomach cramps for years now to a point where she cannot even study. She has has been tested for all kinds of problems and the doctors still cannot find anything. Can you please advise if any yoga exercise will help her? </p>
<p> God will bless you highly for what you are doing. Thank you! </p>

<p> Similarly you can ask your friends daughter to contact me. If doctors did not find any medical problem and permit her to do yoga, yoga may help by reducing anxiety, stress and improving the functioning of digestive system. </p>

I do tummy yoga exercises for one hour. But I do not sweat even doing yoga and running. And please tell in how many months I can reduce my weight 10kg. And give some more hints to reduce tummy fast. Thanks. </p>
<p> Editors Note You are on the right track. While running will help you to burn more calories, yoga practice will tone up your body. However, weight loss will not be possible if diet control is not exercised. Aim to maintain your running and yoga for at least six months and you will find the difference. Aim for gradual weight loss, around 1-1.5 Kg of weight loss a month. This way you will achieve relatively permanent weight loss till such time you control your diet. </p>

<p> Editors Note </p>
<p> Hello </p>
<p> From your query it is not clear at what time you go to office and what time you get up. It seems you are too keen to do yoga. If there is no other alternative then you can do you can do yoga at 10 P.M provided you do not eat any food 3 hour prior to that. Doing yoga at 10 P.M is definitely better than doing no yoga at all. Please take care that you are not too much tired and stomach is empty. </p>
<p> Better alternative is to sleep early and do yoga in the morning due to following reasons: </p>
<p> ~ In the evening your body will be too tired to get maximum benefits of yoga and you are likely to fall asleep during shavasana. ~ It will be difficult to manage your dinner timings and yoga. With yoga practice it is advisable to have fixed meal timings, and dinner should be as early as possible. </p>

<p> I suggest drink your lime juice or fruit juice or vegetable juice just after waking up. After that, you may take 15-20 minutes to freshen up, empty the bowels or take a shower. Thereafter you will be ready to start with your yoga practice including surya namaskars. </p>

<p> Jogging And Then Yoga by: Ramesh Dear Sir, </p>
<p> I am very new to yoga. I wake up early morning 5'Oclock after that I want to go jogging and then I would like to start my yoga practice also. Is this good or bad for my health. </p>
<p> After jogging I am feeling tired and I think I am not participating in yoga well. For getting energy after jogging which food you suggest me. Or, it it better to start yoga and then do jogging. Please reply soon. </p>

<p> 4. It is recommended that you eat/drink something before you go for and then do not eat anything between your jog and subsequent yoga session. </p>
<p> 5. What to eat or drink depends on what you like and you must be comfortable for the jog. It can be ~ a cup of tea or half a glass of milk with few biscuits ~ or a fruit/ fruit juice ~ or lime juice with two/ three spoons of honey. </p>

<p> Gastric Patient by: padaka k Acharya Feel so good to read these all information, I'm also having serious problem, n putting here a question. </p>
<p> I'm 33 years old man and get married before two years. I'm having serious gastric problem since two and half years ago, and got endoscopy test before 5 month, and got result of H-pillory, doctor instruct me to take antibiotic pill. I got some what relief from serious problem but not fully healed. Till today I'm taking Esomoprazol tab for gastric. The big thing is I also affect by depression since marriage and I consulted with mental doctor, he gave me medicine:- 1. Minil-contain-propranolol hydrochloride 10mg 2. Triad-contain-amitriptyline hydrochloride 25mg 3. Mizest-contain-mirtazapine 15mg 4. Zapiz-contain-clonazepam-0.25mg </p>
<p> I'm taking these medicine since I got married but there is no progress. Another thing is I'm feeling so week and having problems in leading happy married life. I feel so badly week, heart burn begin, even I can't go outside, I'm not doing any job for 1.5 years. Hearing from my friend, yoga is only one thing for any physical and mental problem, so want to try it. Please give me instruction which yoga asana is best for me. I am non vegetarian but I avoid fats and spicy food for one year. </p>
<p> Editors Note </p>
<p> It is recommended that you learn yoga under supervision of a yoga teacher. It may take few weeks of practice before you get appreciable relief. Here are few suggestions: - </p>
<p> ~ Eat a vegetarian sattvik diet ~ As a beginner, you must start with few asanas that you can do comfortably, shavasana, yoga nidra, rhythmic breathing and alom vilom pranayama. The basic idea is to get adequate rest and relaxation. ~ Get proper sleep of 7 to 8 hours. ~ Try any alternative therapy like ayurveda or homeopathy along with yoga. ~ Once you become comfortable with basic yoga practice, do more of pranayama for getting more energy and relaxation. ~ Try to do some work at home and get rid of any stress or fears. </p>

<p> Editors Note </p>
<p> You can consult your yoga instructor regarding this issue. There can be problem with your technique, or doing too much of yoga beyond your physical strength or you are physically tired before doing yoga. </p>
<p> Relax completely after a yoga class in shavasana. Take early dinner. Before sleeping do some rhythmic breathing while focussing on your breath. If problem persists, you can consider changing your style of yoga. </p>

<p> Eating Healthy by: Ramesh G Eat every bite of food chewing and mixing with saliva deliberately for more time. Importantly stop eating when when you get your first blurp. That avoids over eating and even the tastiest of any good cannot be consumed more if you eat like this. Eat again when you feel hungry. Eventually you will follow a pattern. Don't drink water 30 minutes before and after eating. Else you risk dilution of digestive juices in stomach. This technique is very simple. You will start seeing improvements in 48 to 72 hours. Have more to share. Reply back if any guidance is needed. </p>

<p> Sensitivity to Food by: shruti Hello, I am an advanced practitioner of yoga and prayanyam for last 5 years. I have noticed a great sensitivity to food as I am advancing in yoga. I am a pure vegeterain and have noticed my gradual disinterest in spicy foods. But I do occasionally eat at restaurants and indulge in spicy food at times. Whenever I do this, I see bad side effects... like a gastro reflux resulting almost imediately in a sore throat hoarse voice etc. Is this common? </p>
<p> I am unable to eat out completely now due to these side effects and have become very sensitive to spicy foods and sometimes when I have no choice I have to eat out BUT just CANNOT. I would think yoga is making my digestion better and I should be able to digest fried heavy foods but infact I feel my digestion is getting weaker. Is this a why a SATTVIC diet is so strongly recommended? Does anyone else also see such digestion sensitivity? </p>
<p> Thank you! Shruti </p>
<p> Editors Note Thanks Shruti for sharing your experience. As you advance in yoga the tendency to eat sattvik food is strengthened. Also, yoga practice and eating sattvik food clears the toxins from the body. Afterwards, as and when we eat junk or fast food, it is not easily accepted by the body. </p>
<p> In case, you have to eat out, you can be more selective while ordering your food. Rely more on food items which are freshly prepared without much of spices. For example rice, idli (rice pancakes), curd, salads, fruits, fresh fruit juices etc. </p>
<p> Your digestive system is not getting weaker, it is getting more efficient and is indicating to you what foods to avoid. </p>
<p> Hope this helps. Daljit </p>
<p> P.S I suggest you submit your query to yoga diet submissions page so that it can be built up as a separate page on this site for better response from site visitors. </p>

However, I never really paid much attention to my diet till I graduated high school. Rodney Yee and Tara Stiles inspired me to advance in yoga. I want to live a happy, free, energetic and healthy lifestyle. </p>
<p> So, question??? In order for me to become an expert in yoga I have to lay off the meat?? It will be hard because I love meat. The sugar and junk food will be easy to give up but, the meat, not so much, LOL. </p>
<p> Editors Note Though it is preferable to be off meat if you want to adopt yogic lifestyle, you can eat meat if have difficulty giving up eating meat. </p>
<p> I will suggest start yoga and do not worry much about your eating habits, keep eating what you eat now. Eating meat is not good for advanced yoga practice/ meditation, but keep away from processed food, fast food, soft drinks, sodas and other junk food. Gradually shift to more healthy choices. Your yoga practice will help you to make up your mind for healthy eating. </p>

Everyday I do yoga for half an hour in morning but when I go to my workplace I feel weak and I am not able to get enough sleep can anybody tell me this weakness is due to lack of sleep or yoga or lack of nutrition in body. </p>
<p> Editors Note By practicing yoga you should feel more energetic. If possible, meet a yoga teacher and discuss your yoga sequence and life style. However, lack of strength can be due to any of these factors or combination of these: - </p>
<p> Lack of Sleep You must take 7-8 hours of sleep. </p>
<p> Poor Quality of Sleep Do some rhythmic breathing/ deep breathing before sleeping. Also eat a light and early dinner. </p>
<p> Poor Nutrition Eat healthy, easily digestible and nutritious food. </p>
<p> High Stress Levels Try to reduce stress levels. Let go of things and do not think too much. Start doing meditation or try yoga nidra. Lack of proper rest and relaxation can result in poor health. </p>

<p> Changes Due to YOGA by: paru I started doing yoga at 6-7 AM in the morning since last 21 days, 5 times a week. Before that for last 1.5 years I was doing aerobics(3 times/week). But I have noticed that now I feel hungry more. I feel my food digests very fast. I am worried I may gain weight due to eating more. Kindly suggest me what to do. </p>
<p> Editors Note It is great to know that you are getting hungry and able to digest your food. Yoga practice tones up the metabolism. Do not worry if you do yoga and eat in moderation, you will not gain weight. Follow the yogic principles of eating, eat a balanced healthy diet and do yoga for one hour. </p>
<p> Eat plenty of low calorie foods mainly fruits and vegetables, practice moderation in eating, avoid binging. </p>
<p> However, if your lifestyle is sedentary, remember that weight gain depends on your calorie intake and calories burnt. So take more of low calorie foods and go for a walk or a run. Adopt an active lifestyle. </p>

<p> Eating After Yoga by: Anonymous After yoga,do not eat after 30 minutes. Why do we have to wait for 30 minutes before you be able to eat? </p>
<p> Editors Note Yoga practice massages and revitalises our body organs. Also yoga increases our vital energy i.e prana. It is better to allow the body to normalise after yoga practice and this vital energy will rejuvenate our body. We may not want to load our digestive system just after a rejuvenaing yoga session. </p>
<p> We generally do not fee much hungry after yoga and can wait for at least 30 minutes before eating anything. You can drink warm milk or any light breakfast. </p>
<p> For example if you do yoga in the evening, you must ensure that you are not feeling hungry before starting yoga. Or you can take some health drink an hour before yoga so that you do not feel hungry before doing yoga. </p>
<p> Just listen to your body. If you feel famished after yoga practice, drink a cup of tea or warm milk after 15 minutes of yoga practice. </p>

<p> Feeling Hungry While Doing Yoga by: Karishma Usually I have dinner around 7 PM, and doing my pranayams and meditation starting around 6-7 AM in the morning. At a certain point in doing kapalabhati I feel tremendously hungry, but I restrain myself from eating until I have completed the whole session. Will this do any bad to my body? Like weight gain? Thank You.. </p>
<p> Editors Note If you can control your hunger while doing yoga it is better. You can take preferably warm milk or tea 30 minutes after doing yoga. Eat light breakfast or fruits 45 to 60 minutes after doing yoga. </p>
<p> If you cannot control your hunger it is better to take some energy drink after getting up in the morning and do yoga around 30 to 45 minutes later. Best option is to take one glass of lime juice with one or two teaspoon of honey. Other option is to drink a cup of coffee or cup of warm low fat milk (or dilute the milk). </p>

<p> Foods To Help Weight loss while doing hot yoga by: Ace Hi </p>
<p> I just wanted to say thank you for all the great information. </p>
<p> I was getting very bad neck pain and Back Pains. I tried getting it massaged but that just made it worse. (This was going to for 3 weeks. I didn’t know what to do, until I saw the Hot Yoga advertisement. I thought I should give it a try. Well after the 1st class my pain felt a bit better. And After the 3rd class I felt like a free person. I haven’t been able to get over how bad the pain was and how easy it was to just do yoga and relax my body and mind. It is really a stress relive class. </p>
<p> But I have a few questions: What should I do know to get the weight loss?. I’ve had kids – so I have the baby tummy. What type of foods should I eat after hot yoga to make my body loss pounds faster? And what type of dinner should I be eating? </p>
<p> Editors Note 1. Practice yoga regularly and it will help you to lose weight. 2. Eat healthy and eat smaller portions. Eat more of salads and fruits. Eat food which is fresh, nutritious, cooked without much spices and is easy to digest. Avoid sugar, packaged and processed fast food or sodas and soft drinks. </p>

<p> relation of diet and yoga by: Anonymous Dear Sir </p>
<p> My question is, why yoga can not be practiced after meal? If possible please give me scientific answer. </p>
<p> Editors Note It is advised that yoga should not be done upto three hours after eating a meal. Here are my views on the subject. </p>
<p> 1. I will not be able to give you any scientific proof. However, you can know the difference yourself by experience. I suggest one day eat very light and easy to digest sattvik food and then do yoga after 3 hours. Next day you fill your stomach with spicy or processed rajasik/ tamasik food which is difficult to digest and do yoga after 3 hours. By using your body awareness you can realise the difference. </p>
<p> 2. After heavy meals you cannot do the asanas which puts pressure on abdomen. Also, you will not be able to breathe fully when stomach is full with food. </p>
<p> 3. Yoga is to be done with least effort and distraction for relaxation of body and mind. Therefore, your body should not be busy attending to digesting the food when all your energy is required for doing the asanas and focusing your mind. Can we do yoga when stomach is growling or burping? </p>
<p> 4. At the same time, you should not do yoga if you are feeling hungry. If you feel hungry before doing yoga, take some fruit juice or preferably half a glass of warm milk with honey or some fruit about 30 to 45 minutes before doing yoga. </p>
<p> 5. Dring enough water during the day to keep you hydrated for the yoga practice. </p>

<p> Editors Note </p>
<p> Yes you can do yoga provided your stomach is empty and you have taken adequate sleep after doing night duty. You can do your breakfast after coming back from night shift, sleep for 7-8 hours and then do yoga. Exact timings for your yoga practice will depend on time available to you and following the time limits for not eating before and after yoga. </p>

<p> Thanks and Regards, </p>
<p> Editors note 1. If you have spare time, there is nothing wrong in doing yoga in the evening. Only requirement is that you should not be too tired and stomach should be empty. </p>
<p> 2. For correct eating habits, avoid junk, processed food and eat only the food which provides nutrition. Raw salads, boiled vegetables, whole grains, milk and nuts are some of the best sources of nutrition for a yoga practitioner. </p>
<p> 3. For reducing stress, relax in shavasana and practice yoga nidra. Practice pranayama so that your breathing becomes better. </p>
<p> 4. While in office, maintain erect posture in front of the computer screen. Take frequent breaks and if possible do rhythmic breathing for a while say five minutes. </p>

<p> Suitable Time by: Anonymous Hello there, I am 24 year old and I am busy with work and studies..But I can manage to do yoga and pranayama on saturday, sunday and monday. But for the rest of the days I am busy working from 8 am to 8 pm. So can you guide me what is the proper time I should do yoga and pranayama? </p>

<p> Hello </p>
<p> I will recommend that you do yoga for one hour early morning around 5 A.M. on the days you are free i.e saturday, sunday and monday. </p>
<p> On other days if you can spend 15-20 minutes in the morning, it will be fine. Just do suryanamaskars, alom vilom pranayama and rest in shavasana. </p>
<p> For this you have to eat an early dinner (low calorie and low fat) and sleep early everyday, so that you get 7 to 8 hours of sleep. </p>

<p> Should yoga be done in the night? by: Adnan I skip dinner most of the days as I feel tired after my day's work. I get up in the morning early but sleep off to get up just in time. </p>
<p> Is it appropriate to do yoga in the night after clearing my bowels at around 8:00 p.m or so? </p>
<p> Editors Note Doing yoga late into the night will up your energy levels and you may have trouble sleeping there after. </p>
<p> Otherwise you may do yoga at 8:00 pm. Keep these things in mind: ~ You must not be too tired and must not force your body to do yoga. ~ You must be empty stomach before doing yoga. ~ Do not have heavy dinner after yoga. At least half an hour after doing yoga, take a glass of warm milk or eat some fruits. ~ You must relax in shava asana for 5-10 minutes after yoga practice. After that, if possible, do meditation for 10 minutes. </p>
<p> I personally advise that you sleep early after days work. Get up early in the morning and do yoga. </p>

<p> 6 Foods to Eat While Taking Antibiotics (and 4 to Avoid) </p>
<p> Antibiotics are a common way to fight infections, but many don’t realize there are certain foods to eat while taking antibiotics. </p>
<p> Antibiotic therapy is the first line of treatment for the majority of bacterial infections. Unfortunately, these drugs aren’t without side effects. </p>
<p> Rarely, they can cause a variety of unpleasant symptoms like </p>
<p> Bloating </p>
<p> Diarrhea </p>
<p> Nausea </p>
<p> Abdominal pain </p>
<p> Although these side effects are usually mild, transient, and harmless, they can become severe and signal the need for a change in medication. </p>
<p> Sometimes, patients find they can control these side effects, or even eliminate them completely, with just a few basic diet changes. </p>
<p> In other cases, it’s the food causing the problem and removing it from their diet is enough. </p>
<p> In this post, we’ll tell you about six of the best foods to eat while taking antibiotics – and the four you should always avoid, too. </p>
<p> Why Do Antibiotics Cause GI Side Effects? </p>
<p> During times of good health, your body maintains a balance of good and bad bacteria in your intestines. </p>
<p> The natural ratio of good bacteria to bad is set at just the right rate for both to coexist without causing you any harm. </p>
<p> When you take antibiotics, the very drugs you take to fight off an infection also target the good bacteria in your G.I. tract, too. </p>
<p> The result? </p>
<p> Your intestines lose the delicate balance maintained between both sides, leading to gastrointestinal upset and other unpleasant symptoms. </p>
<p> The Best Foods to Eat While Taking Antibiotics </p>
<p> Good news: certain foods support good bacteria levels in your body. </p>
<p> These are the best foods to eat while taking antibiotics. By eating them, you reduce or eliminate the side effects common to antibiotic treatment. </p>
<p> Most of these contain either probiotics or prebiotics. </p>
<p> A few of the most common foods to eat while taking antibiotics include: </p>
<p> Prebiotics — Prebiotics are the building blocks for healthy gut bacteria. When you ingest them, they help to make your gut a friendly place for more healthy bacteria to grow. Find them in kefir, yogurt, and even fortified cereals. </p>
<p> Yogurt and Fermented Milk — Both yogurt and fermented milk (kefir) increase the presence of Lactobacilli (a critical element of digestion) in the intestines. They also significantly curb overflow of bad bacteria at the same time. </p>
<p> Kimchi and Fermented Soy Products — Kimchi and fermented soy products are loaded with probiotics and prebiotics. They’re also rich in another digestion-critical bacteria called Bifidobacteria. </p>
<p> Foods High in Vitamin K — Antibiotic treatment can rarely lead to Vitamin K deficiency which may contribute to bacteria imbalances. Get more K by ingesting leafy green vegetables, cauliflower, liver, and eggs. </p>
<p> Coconut Oil — This medium-chain triglyceride contains fatty acids, which may help to reduce your risk of developing an antibiotic-related yeast infection. If you’re female, this will be especially helpful to you! </p>
<p> What Foods to NOT Eat While Taking Antibiotics </p>
<p> There are some foods you should avoid while on antibiotics, either because they interfere with absorption or because the combination can make you feel sick. </p>
<p> In most cases, these foods simply interact poorly and make the antibiotics less effective. </p>
<p> Foods to avoid include: </p>
<p> Grapefruit — You should avoid both the fruit and the juice of this sour citrus product. It contains compounds that can keep the body from properly absorbing your antibiotics – as well as other medications, too! </p>
<p> Excess Calcium — Some studies show that excess calcium interferes with absorption. For best results, stick to fermented dairy products until you are finished with your antibiotics. </p>
<p> Alcohol — Mixing alcohol and antibiotics can lead to a host of unpleasant side effects. The most common of these are </p>
<p> Increased nausea </p>
<p> Abdominal pain </p>
<p> Dizziness </p>
<p> Heart rate issues. You should avoid alcohol throughout the duration of treatment and for 48 to 72 hours after treatment ends. </p>
<p> Sugars and Yeast — For some patients (especially women) antibiotic usage may lead to candida (yeast) infections. Avoid foods high in sugar and yeast to avoid feeding the candida organism. This is especially important if you find you nearly always end up with a yeast infection after a course of antibiotics. </p>
<p> Taking Antibiotics Properly </p>
<p> Along with knowing the best foods to eat while taking antibiotics, they must also be taken as directed. </p>
<p> Improper use can render them ineffective or even cause antibiotic resistance over time. Heed these tips to stay on the right track. </p>
<p> 1. Antibiotics begin their work as soon as they enter your bloodstream. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll feel well right away. It may take a day or two before you really begin to feel better. In the meantime, discuss what you can do to control your symptoms with your doctor. Don’t end treatment early unless directed by your physician, even if you think it isn’t working. </p>
<p> 2. Always finish your antibiotic treatment as prescribed. A lot of people stop taking their antibiotics when they feel better in order to avoid further side effects. This may lead to the infection not properly clearing, resulting in recurrence and the need for another round of medication. </p>
<p> 3. Never double up on antibiotic doses, especially if you miss a dose, unless specifically directed. Taking more won’t make you feel better faster. In the case of a missed dose, simply resume at your next scheduled time and continue taking your medication until you run out. </p>
<p> 4. Women should be especially cautious when taking antibiotics. Yeast infection development is the biggest concern, but can be prevented if you stay on top of taking probiotics or eating yogurt. </p>
<p> 5. Antibiotics also reduce the effectiveness of birth control. Women taking these drugs should abstain or use a backup method until they finish treatment. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Doctors and researchers are now working hard to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance each year. </p>
<p> We now know that antibiotics should really only be used when absolutely necessary. </p>
<p> Rest assured: your doctor won’t prescribe them unless they really feel you need them. </p>
<p> Taking them properly and supporting your body through the process will speed up your recovery and reduce the need for a change in medication or a second course. </p>
<p> Have additional questions? Talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Otherwise, do your best to keep your diet in check and you should be able to keep the side effects under control! </p>

<p> The key is to lower your fiber intake. Check the labels of everything you eat to make sure your not getting too much fiber. </p>

<p> I need a list of foods to be able to eat while on 10 days of augmentin. I take 2 probiotics a day </p>
<p> Foods high in Sugar are not recommended when taking antibiotics. Pass on the rice crispy treats until your course of antibiotics is complete. </p>
<p> Kathy was not taking about rice krispie squares she was asking if the breakfast cereal Rice Krispies was ok to eat! </p>
<p> Hi Betty, thanks for your comment! Please feel free to contact our pharmacy staff at (805) 498-6675 to discuss the best course of action after receiving antibiotics! </p>
<p> I just wanted to knkw if I could eat green grapes since Im taking antibiotics and dont wanna lessen the effects or anything. </p>
<p> is drinking water good…? I have coeliac disease and it is really making my tummy swell. Can you please just list some simple remedy or foods to eat for a Coeliac person. </p>
<p> Should I or can I buy probiotics tablets to help? </p>
<p> If so where from and will they reduce the swelling of my tummy? </p>
<p> i don’t know anything about Coeliac, but yes, drink plenty of water. Prebiotics and probiotics are very important while taking antibiotics in order to reduce damage to you “good” gut bacteria; however, take the pre & probiotics at least two hours before or after you take the antibiotics. </p>
<p> Hi Erica, I’ve had really bad coeliac disease since I was young. In fact my small intestine erupted and my young sin called the emt’s and I received life-saving surgery. This is not a disease to take lightly. One of the best pieces of advice was to eat a ‘gluten-free diet’ It’s helped me incredibly and honestly now days you can obtain most good thing gf. Feel free to contact me with any questions Suzanne </p>
<p> hello may i know about gluten free diet chart? do u have and can ahare it with me thnak you </p>
<p> I cover the antibiotics with peanut butter as I have a hard tome swallowing is this okay? </p>
<p> Hi Liz! I don’t see why not! If it makes them taste better and helps you to swallow antibiotics, I would keep doing it!! </p>
<p> I wouldn’t do that, the peanut butter that you find in the supermarket is just saturated fats and sugar. you will be feeding the candida yeast. </p>
<p> I have MAC and going on 4 different antibiotics for a year or more. Also, have had CDiff in the past, so not thrilled about this. Being proactive, want to monitor my diet. Don’t like sugary things, so should be ok there, but like the idea of peanut butter to get these larger pills down (have difficulty swallowing large pills…but now worried about the sugar there) Also like yoghurt but reports on that are confusing. Any advice would be comforting. Thank you. (80 years old,by the way) </p>
<p> Please purchase Elaine Gotschell’s book, “Breakng The Viscious Cycle”. It has helped many with Coeliac Disease. This (combined with the coconut oil) does wonders. God Bless you. </p>
<p> I am taking Amoxicillin /clavulanic acid and would like to know if half a banana is good to take with the Med at bedtime.What should I avoid? </p>
<p> My wife is 83 years old am now was prescribed fluconazole (Candida) and amoxicillin / lansoprazole ( hbacter pylori ) . It isn’t too much according to her age ?. </p>

<p> What to Do If You Get Food Stuck in Your Throat </p>
<p> We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process. </p>
<p> Overview </p>
<p> Swallowing is a complex process. When you eat, around 50 pairs of muscles and many nerves work together to move food from your mouth to your stomach. It’s not uncommon for something to go wrong during this process, making it feel like you have food stuck in your throat. </p>
<p> When you take a bite of solid food, a three-step process begins: </p>
<p> You prepare the food to be swallowed by chewing it. This process allows the food to mix with saliva, and transforms it into a moistened puree. </p>
<p> Your swallowing reflex is triggered as your tongue pushes the food to the back of your throat. During this phase, your windpipe closes tightly and your breathing stops. This prevents food from going down the wrong pipe. </p>
<p> The food enters your esophagus and travels down into your stomach. </p>
<p> When it feels like something didn’t go all the way down, it’s usually because it’s stuck in your esophagus. Your breathing isn’t affected when this happens because the food has already cleared your windpipe. However, you may cough or gag. </p>
<p> Symptoms of food stuck in your esophagus develop immediately after it happens. It’s not uncommon to have severe chest pain. You may also experience excessive drooling. But there are often ways to resolve the issue at home. </p>
<p> Thousands of people die from choking every year. It’s particularly common among young children and adults over the age of 74. Choking happens when food or a foreign object gets stuck in your throat or windpipe, blocking the flow of air. </p>
<p> make squeaky sounds when trying to breathe </p>
<p> Choking is a life-threatening emergency. If you or a loved one experiences these symptoms, call your local emergency services and perform rescue techniques such as the Heimlich maneuver or chest compressions immediately. </p>
<p> The following techniques may assist you in removing food that’s become lodged in your esophagus. </p>
<p> The ‘Coca-Cola’ trick </p>
<p> Research suggests that drinking a can of Coke, or another carbonated beverage, can help dislodge food stuck in the esophagus. Doctors and emergency workers often utilize this simple technique to break up food. </p>
<p> Although they don’t know exactly how it works, doctors believe that the carbon dioxide gas in soda helps disintegrate the food. It’s also thought that some of the soda gets into the stomach, which then releases gas. The pressure of the gas can dislodge the stuck food. </p>
<p> Try a few cans of diet soda or seltzer water at home immediately after noticing the stuck food. </p>
<p> Simethicone </p>
<p> Over-the-counter medications designed to treat gas pain may help dislodge food stuck in the esophagus. In the same way as carbonated sodas, medications containing simethicone (Gas-X) make it easier for your stomach to produce gas. This gas increases the pressure in your esophagus and can push the food loose. </p>
<p> Follow the standard dosing recommendation on the package. </p>
<p> Water </p>
<p> A few big sips of water may help you wash down the food stuck in your esophagus. Normally, your saliva provides enough lubrication to help food slide easily down the esophagus. If your food wasn’t chewed properly, it may be too dry. Repeated sips of water may moisten the stuck food, making it go down more easily. </p>
<p> A moist piece of food </p>
<p> It may feel uncomfortable to swallow something else, but sometimes one food can help push another down. Try dipping a piece of bread in some water or milk to soften it, and take a few small bites. </p>
<p> Another effective option may be to take a bite of banana, a naturally soft food. </p>
<p> Alka-Seltzer or baking soda </p>
<p> An effervescent drug like Alka-Seltzer may help break down food that’s stuck in the throat. Effervescent drugs dissolve when mixed with a liquid. Similar to soda, the bubbles they produce when dissolving may help disintegrate the food and produce pressure that can dislodge it. </p>
<p> If you don’t have Alka-Seltzer, you can try mixing some baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, with water. This may help dislodge food in the same way. </p>
<p> Butter </p>
<p> Sometimes the esophagus needs an extra bit of lubrication. As unpleasant as it may sound, it may help to eat a tablespoon of butter. This can sometimes help moisten the lining of the esophagus and make it easier for the stuck food to move down into your stomach. </p>
<p> Wait it out </p>
<p> Food that gets stuck in the throat usually passes on its own, given some time. Give your body a chance to do its thing. </p>
<p> If you’re unable to swallow your saliva and are experiencing distress, go to your local emergency room as soon as possible. If you’re not in distress but the food is still stuck, you can have an endoscopic procedure to remove the food within 24 hours. After that, there’s risk of damage to the lining of your esophagus. Some doctors recommend coming in after 6 to 12 hours to reduce the likelihood of damage and make the extraction easier. </p>
<p> During an endoscopic procedure, your doctor can identify any possible underlying causes. If you frequently get food stuck in your throat, you should consult a doctor. One of the most common problems is a narrowing of the esophagus caused by the buildup of scar tissue, or esophageal stricture. A specialist can treat esophageal stricture by placing a stent or performing a dilation procedure. </p>
<p> Getting food stuck in your throat can be frustrating and painful. If this occurs frequently, talk to your doctor about possible underlying causes. Otherwise, you may be able to avoid a trip to the emergency room by treating yourself at home with carbonated beverages or other remedies. </p>
<p> In the future, be particularly careful when eating meat, as it’s the most common culprit. Avoid eating too quickly, take small bites, and avoid eating while intoxicated. </p>

<p> 12 foods you can eat after their 'best before' date </p>
<p> Chocolate and booze should never be binned. </p>
<p> Jan 26, 2021 </p>
<p> Getty Images </p>
<p> PSA to those of you who throw your food away as soon as it hits the Best Before date: you really, really don't need to. In fact, most of the dates on your food labels are for shops, and not for shoppers (hence 'sell by), and yet, we're still throwing away as much as £346 worth of quality, edible food from each household a year. </p>
<p> New research from Too Good To Go found that 45% of adults are confused about the meaning of Best Before labels. So, to be clear: Use Bys are important, because they refer to actual food safety, where as Best Before rules a little more flexible. </p>
<p> "The truth is that the dates given on Best Before labels are often extremely conservative and that food can have a much longer life than is specified, with no significant drop in quality," Jamie Crummie, Co-Founder of Too Good To Go, said. "The best way to tell if a food is good to eat is to look at it, smell it, taste it and to trust your own judgment.” </p>
<p> You won't ever catch a Best Before on meat or fish because this could be unsafe to eat – these will have a Use By date instead. But the food that you can be a little more flexible with? </p>
<p> Foods you can eat after their Sell By / Best Before date </p>
<p> Yoghurt </p>
<p> Bet you're surprised by that one, huh? While the texture and taste of yoghurt may change over time, the acidic nature of the product means bad bacteria are kept at bay almost indefinitely - particularly if the yoghurt is unopened, and has been stored correctly. So if your yoghurt looks, smells and tastes okay, it should be perfectly safe to eat for several weeks past the Best Before date. </p>
<p> Chocolate </p>
<p> You know that kind of white, grainy look chocolate gets when it's been hanging around for a while? It's called bloom, and is caused by the crystallisation of the fat and sugar in the bars. Honestly, it doesn't look great, and it does affect the quality a bit, but it's pretty much safe to eat - it just depends how desperate you are for that bar of Dairy Milk from last Christmas that you just found at the back of the cupboard... </p>
<p> Getty Images </p>
<p> Eggs </p>
<p> There's a really simple way to tell if your eggs are still okay once the Best Before date has passed - put them into a jug of cold water. If they sink, they're still fresh, if they sit on the bottom but point upwards, they're on the turn but should be alright, and if they float? Get rid of them, asap - the older an egg is, the longer air has been entering the shell and making it buoyant. Oh, and btw, even if the test totally fails you and you end up cracking a bad egg, you'll know about it - they absolutely stink. </p>
<p> Crisps </p>
<p> Crisps can totally go soft or stale, depending on whether you're a Kettle Crisp or Monster Munch kinda person, but they're also really high in salt, which helps to preserve them well after their Best Before dates. If you've got a half-open packet in the cupboard, seal them up with a plastic clip, and don't sweat it if you finish them a few days after the numbers tell you to. </p>
<p> Getty Images </p>
<p> Biscuits </p>
<p> Similarly, biscuits and crackers that have been left open will lose their crunch, but won't go off for a while - they'll just develop a kind of stale taste. The only risk factor is if some of the oils in the recipe go off, so be sure to give them a good sniff before you dunk them in your tea, and chuck them if they taste even remotely funky. </p>
<p> Tinned food </p>
<p> Got a stash of beans and tinned tomatoes you bought with the intention of cooking up some healthy stews and soups? Yeah, us too, and they've sat there ever since. Apparently, the dates on canned foods are around three years after they hit the shelves, but they're usually alright to use a little while afterwards. As long as they've been kept in a cool, dark area as instructed, you should be safe to use them the next time you're a little skint and/or hungry. </p>
<p> Getty Images </p>
<p> Bread </p>
<p> The Best Before on bread is just a guideline - they might not be at their best after this point, but loaves that've gone a bit hard can be eaten without any problems. For stale bread, try sprinkling with water or warming it through in the oven to soften it up - or to extend the life of fresh bread, keep it in a cool, dark place (NOT the fridge, as often recommended; this actually makes it go stale quicker). </p>
<p> Fruit and veg </p>
<p> The freshness of produce should always be on your radar, but if it looks and smells fine (and isn't unreasonably past the Best Before) you should be okay to eat it. If it's on the turn - not mouldy, but just looking a bit sad - you can still whizz it into smoothies or soups or make it into chutney. Taking precautions, but still sick of finding gone-off berries in their punnet? Try these genius hacks to keep your healthy food fresh for longer. </p>

<p> Dry pasta </p>
<p> The main rule with pasta is to make sure whatever you're storing it in is airtight - if that's the case, it should last for absolutely yonks because there's no moisture to cause it to expire. So if your penne is a few days 'pasta' its sell by (sorry), there's nothing to stop you boiling it up. </p>
<p> Hard cheese </p>
<p> OK so you obviously shouldn't eat cheese - or any dairy, for that matter - that's super out of date and covered in mould, but sturdy cheeses like Cheddar and Parmesan have surprisingly long shelf lives. On the flip side, it's worth noting that you don't want to apply the same policy to soft cheese like Brie and Camembert (or the end of a tub of Philadelphia..), as the more moist a cheese is, the more likely it is to go off when your back is turned. </p>
<p> Getty Images </p>
<p> Honey and jam </p>
<p> Just like crisps are kept relatively fresh by their high levels of salt, preserves are, er… preserved by their high levels of sugar. They won't keep indefinitely, but can definitely be eaten after the Best Before, particularly if they've not even been opened yet. When stored properly, they tend to last for around 6 months - just use your common sense, and don't go eating anything that's furry round the top of the jar. </p>
<p> Alcohol </p>
<p> Mmhmm, the one we've all been waiting for. Alcohol does go off, but it often takes years, and some booze, like wine, actually gets better with age (not when opened, though). When times become desperate at a house party, you should still go careful with anything cream-based or that's been sat in direct sunlight for too long, but with hard spirits like vodka and whiskey, you won't get sick from a few past Best Before shots. Hooray! </p>

<p> 15 foods you can eat past their expiration dates </p>
<p> Oftentimes expiration dates are a guideline and not a strict rule, usually referencing the quality rather than the actual safety of the food. </p>
<p> Although it is still important to check the packaging, there are quite a few foods where the date has no significance. </p>
<p> Dry, boxed pasta can last for quite some time if it's unopened. </p>
<p> Oftentimes "expired" bread is fine to eat if you don't see any mold. </p>
<p> It's a common misconception that the date printed on packaged food is a firm deadline for when you should toss it. </p>
<p> In reality, one of the only items in the US with a federally-regulated expiration date is infant formula ― which is why "sell by" dates and "best if used by (or before)" dates are more of a guideline than a rule. </p>
<p> As Paul VanLandingham, a senior faculty member at the Center for Food and Beverage Management of Johnson & Wales University explained in an interview with WebMD, these numbers refer to food quality rather than food safety. </p>
<p> Although the former dictates how long a store should display a product to ensure its highest level of quality, the latter refers to long consumers should keep a product before it loses flavor or declines in quality. </p>
<p> When it comes to these 15 food items, you can oftentimes disregard the date on the package. </p>
<p> You can keep dry, boxed pasta for one to two years past its printed date. </p>
<p> According to FoodSafety.gov, a food resource from the US Department of Health & Human Services, dry pasta can be kept for one to two years past its printed expiry date </p>
<p> Fresh (uncooked) pasta ― the kind you'll often find in the refrigerated section of the supermarket next to Italian cheese ― is only good for four to five days beyond the date printed on the packaging. When frozen, it will typically keep for six to eight months. </p>
<p> Generally, cooked pasta, whether dry or fresh, can be kept for seven days in the fridge. In the freezer, it will typically stay fresh for six to eight months. </p>
<p> When it's unopened, breakfast cereal lasts six to eight months past the date on the box. </p>
<p> In contrast, cooked cereals such as oatmeal will only keep for four to five days in the fridge once prepared. </p>
<p> "Cereals don't really go bad. There is not that much of a quality issue. If you leave your cereal box open, it can get stale, but you are still not going to get sick from it," Emily Broad Leib, the director of Harvard Food Law & Policy Clinic, told TIME magazine. </p>
<p> No matter what date is on the carton, you can use eggs within three to five weeks of purchasing them. </p>
<p> There are many ways to check if an egg has gone bad (like doing the float test or sniffing it to see if it has a sulfur smell), but generally the fresher the egg the better it tastes. </p>
<p> "In terms of freshness, a company can put a sell-by date or best used-by date on the carton. There is no regulation on that. The date is a good indicator of freshness," Kevin Murphy, food safety and sanitation expert and professor and chair of hospitality services at the University of Central Florida's Rosen College of Hospitality Management, previously told Insider. </p>
<p> "The closer you get to the date, the less fresh the eggs are going to be. But, just because you've hit that date or gone beyond it doesn't mean that the eggs are necessarily bad," he added. </p>
<p> Raw meat and poultry keep long past their sell-by date if you freeze them. </p>
<p> Although raw meat and poultry will only keep for a few days in the fridge, these items can be kept past their sell-by date if you freeze them. </p>
<p> "Food poisoning bacteria does not grow in the freezer, so no matter how long a food is frozen, it is safe to eat. Foods that have been in the freezer for months may be dry, or may not taste as good, but they will be safe to eat," according to the US Department of Agriculture report on the agency's blog. </p>
<p> Raw fish also lasts much longer in the freezer. </p>
<p> Smoked fish can last for three to six months in the freezer, and commercially frozen fish will keep for 10 to 12 months if it doesn't thaw. </p>
<p> Additionally, unopened canned fish (such as tuna) can keep for between two and five years past its printed date. </p>
<p> As with many food items, appearance and odor will tell you more about if cheese is safe to eat than the number on the package. </p>
<p> Even if cheese (whole, cut, or sliced) grows mold, it can often be salvaged by cutting around the decay. </p>
<p> In fact, white mold is normal on so-called "bloomy rind" or soft-ripened cheeses like Camembert and Brie, according to the Gourmet Cheese Detective. Most colored molds, such as the orange, blue, and green varieties, however, are not edible. </p>
<p> Of course, the brighter mold is okay when it comes to blue cheeses ― but only if it's spread evenly in a vein-like pattern and not concentrated in one spot. </p>
<p> Leafy greens, including bagged salads, can be revived with ice water if they begin to wilt. </p>
<p> For example, you can resuscitate semi-wilted greens by submerging them in ice water for five to 10 minutes. </p>
<p> You can keep dairy milk five days or more past its printed date. </p>
<p> How long milk keeps depends on its fat content. Although non-fat milk can last between seven and 10 days, you can keep whole milk five to seven days past the date on the carton. </p>
<p> If milk does spoil, it will look discolored with a lumpy texture and dispel a sour odor. </p>
<p> Canned foods have a long shelf life. </p>
<p> With the exception of highly acidic items like tomatoes and pineapple, canned vegetables, and some canned soups are okay to eat a year or two after they "expire." </p>
<p> Unopened packages of frozen fruit and frozen vegetables are good for eight to 10 months beyond their printed date. </p>
<p> Eat By Date advises that unopened packages of frozen fruit and frozen vegetables can both keep for eight to 10 months past their printed date. </p>
<p> When unopened and refrigerated, yogurt will last two to three weeks past the date on the container. </p>
<p> In the fridge, unopened yogurt can still be tasty for one to two weeks past its best by date. When frozen, yogurt will keep up to two months, according to StillTasty. </p>
<p> Bread is usually fine to eat if you don't see any mold. </p>
<p> According to StillTasty, packaged bread (such as white bread) will keep for five to seven days at room temperature if it's stored properly. Once refrigerated, it will retain its freshness for three to four days before becoming stale. </p>
<p> If you want to extend its shelf life, packaged bread will stay fresh for at least three months in the freezer. </p>
<p> Unopened jars of peanut butter can keep for up to a year past their printed date. </p>
<p> Natural peanut butter has a shorter shelf life, lasting three to six months past its date if it's stored in the fridge. </p>
<p> In contrast, a sealed jar of another popular, nutty spread ― Nutella — will keep just one to two months past its printed date. </p>
<p> Some condiments, such as ketchup and mustard, are good for a year or two beyond their printed dates if the bottles are unopened. </p>
<p> Honey only really spoils if it's introduced to moisture. </p>
<p> Honey is known for its seemingly indefinite shelf life, a characteristic that can be attributed to the sticky stuff's chemical make-up. </p>
<p> As a sugar, honey is a hygroscopic substance ― one that doesn't contain much water but can absorb moisture from the air. </p>
<p> "Honey in its natural form is very low-moisture," Amina Harris, executive director of the Honey and Pollination Center at the Robert Mondavi Institute at the University of California, Davis, told Smithsonian Magazine. "Very few bacteria or microorganisms can survive in an environment like that, they just die. They're smothered by it, essentially." </p>
<p> That being said, honey can spoil if it's introduced to moisture. Still, contrary to popular belief, just because a jar of honey crystallizes doesn't mean it's gone bad. The grainy texture is caused by glucose molecules as they separate from water. </p>

<p> 7 foods that you can leave out overnight </p>
<p> The USDA says food that has been left out of the fridge for more than two hours should be thrown away. </p>
<p> At room temperature, bacteria grows incredibly fast and can make you sick. </p>
<p> Reheating something that has been sitting at room temperature for longer than two hours won't be safe from bacteria. </p>
<p> There are some types of foods that don't necessarily need to be stored in the fridge and some things like bread, that shouldn't be kept in the fridge at all, so if you leave them out overnight, they're still safe to eat. </p>
<p> You've probably accidentally left food out on your kitchen counter overnight at least once or twice, but is it still safe to eat? </p>
<p> According to the USDA, food that has been left out of the fridge for more than two hours should be thrown away. That's because between 40° F and 140° F (what the USDA calls the "Danger Zone"), bacteria grows incredibly fast and can make you sick. </p>
<p> However, there are types of foods that don't necessarily need to be stored in the refrigerator or won't be as harmful to you if you leave them out for a while. Some foods, like bread, shouldn't even be stored in the fridge in the first place. </p>
<p> Read on to find out what foods are still safe to eat after they've been left out overnight and be sure to throw out anything else that's been left out for longer than two hours, or one hour if it's a hot day. </p>
<p> Bread shouldn't be put in the refrigerator at all. </p>
<p> Though some people believe putting bread in the fridge makes it last longer, it actually does the opposite. Bread kept in the fridge goes stale, according to StillTasty.com, because the cooler temperatures dry it out. </p>
<p> On the counter, bread generally lasts for about a week, but freezing your bread is a safe way to help it last longer. </p>
<p> Certain kinds of pies are safe to leave out for a couple of days before refrigerating them. </p>
<p> Fruit pies are safe to leave at room temperature for two days before refrigerating them as long as they're covered. After that, they can be put in the fridge for another two days before going bad, according to kitchn. </p>
<p> However, pies that have custard or cream fillings should be kept refrigerated at all times and pies made with eggs (such as pumpkin pie or pecan pie) can be warmed up to be served, but should be stored in the fridge. </p>
<p> Pasteurized, salted butter can be left at room temperature for a couple of days. </p>
<p> Though other dairy products have to be stored at or below 40° F to avoid going bad, pasteurized, salted butter is the exception because of its high-fat content, according to an FDA report. </p>
<p> Even though it is unnecessary, refrigeration does help the butter last longer, according to State Food Safety, which also said butter can be left out from a couple of days up to 10 days. </p>
<p> However, homemade or unpasteurized butter should always be kept refrigerated. </p>
<p> Certain condiments don't need to be refrigerated all the time, even after they've been opened. </p>
<p> Condiments like soy sauce, vinegar-based hot sauces and honey shouldn't be refrigerated at all, according to MSN. Meanwhile, ketchup and mustard can be kept in the fridge, but won't be harmful if they're left out overnight, even if they've been opened. </p>
<p> Dijon and horseradish-based mustards should stay in the fridge, but because yellow mustard doesn't have ingredients that spoil, it can stay out, though it may lose flavor, according to the outlet. </p>
<p> Opened containers of mayonnaise, tartar sauce and horseradish should be kept in the fridge. If they are kept at a temperature of 50 °F or more for longer than eight hours, they should be thrown away, according to FoodSafety.gov. </p>
<p> Cheeses can stay out for up to six hours and hard cheeses can stay out even longer. </p>
<p> According to research done in Wisconsin, cheese can stay out for up to six hours at 70°F or cooler without growing life-threatening amounts of bacteria. Hard cheeses like parmesan can even be out for 24 hours safely, Marianne Smukowski from the Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research told Bon Appetit. </p>
<p> However, cheeses may also start to dry out and not look as appealing if they are left out for more than a couple of hours. </p>
<p> There are many raw, uncut fruits that don't have to be stored in the fridge at all. </p>
<p> Bananas, grapefruit, lemons, limes, mangoes, oranges, papaya, pineapple, pomegranates, watermelon, and apples can all be kept out of the fridge, according to Spoon University. However, after seven days, you should move your apples to the fridge to keep them fresh. </p>
<p> Other fruits that should start on your counter, but be moved to your fridge include avocados, peaches, plums, nectarines, and kiwi. </p>
<p> If you cut or cook any of these fruits, though, they should be immediately stored in the fridge to avoid bacterial growth. </p>
<p> Some raw, uncut vegetables can be stored on your counter instead of the fridge. </p>
<p> Peppers, cucumbers, eggplant, garlic, and ginger don't have to be stored in your fridge and onions, tomatoes and potatoes should not be stored in the fridge at all, according to Spoon University. </p>
<p> Onions and tomatoes can start to grow mold if they're kept in the fridge and the cooler temperatures break down the starch in potatoes and make them get grainy. </p>

<p> Foods You Can't Eat if You Have High Uric Acid </p>
<p> 5 minutes </p>
<p> If you have high uric acid, it's important to take care and watch your diet, weight, and some habits. Thanks to a balanced diet you can keep uricemia under control. </p>
<p> Last update: 12 June, 2020 </p>
<p> High uric acid or hyperuricemia has traditionally been related to people who love excesses, both in eating and drinking. Although we know that it depends on a variety of factors, diet change is important if you have high uric acid. </p>
<p> Hyperuricemia or high uric acid </p>
<p> Uric acid is a compound made up of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen that’s created when your body breaks down purines. Purines form naturally in the body, and they’re also found in some foods. </p>
<p> Uric acid doesn’t cause health problems when you have normal levels, since it’s excreted by the kidney. However, sometimes, for various reasons, your uric acid levels can increase beyond acceptable levels. </p>
<p> When you have high uric acid, one of the most feared symptoms is gout. However, the negative consequences of hyperuricemia can be even more serious. It’s related to a higher risk of kidney and cardiovascular problems, and chronic arthritic damage. </p>
<p> Foods that have high uric acid </p>
<p> You should correct an excess of uric acid to avoid long term health problems and loss of quality of life. Changing a few dietary habits can be very beneficial. </p>
<p> If you suffer from this health problem, you should avoid some foods. Although you should keep in mind that we’re not talking about prohibited foods, just foods you should limit. </p>
<p> Purine rich foods </p>
<p> Purines are components that naturally form in the body. When they break down they turn into uric acid. Therefore, controlling your intake of high purine foods can help reduce the amount of uric acid in your blood. Especially during gout outbreaks. </p>
<p> The following are high purine foods: </p>
<p> Liver, kidney, sweetbread, and other organs. </p>
<p> Red meat from cows, sheep, and pigs. </p>
<p> Fatty fish and seafood like sardines, anchovies, tuna, prawns, shrimp, and crab. You shouldn’t get rid of all of them, because then you’d be missing out on their benefits. But you should be eating moderate portions. </p>
<p> Sausages. </p>
<p> Very fermented cheeses. </p>
<p> Some vegetables like asparagus, peas, spinach, and tomato are high in purines. A sensible option is to moderate your consumption of this type of vegetables to once or twice a week. </p>
<p> Fatty foods </p>
<p> It’s harder to eliminate urates when you eat a lot of fat. For this reason, you should control the fat in your diet if you have high uric acid. </p>
<p> The best option, as is almost always the case, is to use extra virgin olive oil. You can use it raw to dress your dishes, and also for cooking. It’s better to completely eliminate processed foods that can have trans or hydrogenated fats, and reduce your saturated fat intake. </p>
<p> Fructose and sugary drinks </p>
<p> Fructose is the only carbohydrate that has been shown to have a direct relation to metabolizing uric acid. In this case, we’re talking about sodas, fruit juice, and other sweetened drinks. The risk of gout is double in people that drink two or more sugary drinks a day, when compared to those who drink less than one per month. </p>
<p> However, we don’t know the exact reason for this increase in uric acid. It could be due to other ingredients in the drinks besides fructose, or because of other unhealthy habits. </p>
<p> Alcohol </p>
<p> In the case of alcoholic drinks, there’s no doubt. The risk of developing gout is more than double among men who drink 50 grams or more of alcohol per day, compared with those who don’t drink alcohol. </p>
<p> Both in men and women, alcohol consumption is related to higher rates of uricemia and gout. In fact, the risk is higher in women. </p>
<p> This is because consuming a lot of alcohol in a short time increases lactic acid concentration. This makes it hard for the kidney to eliminate uric acid. On the other hand, if you chronically drink alcohol, the problem comes from high levels of purines. </p>
<p> Dietary steps to keep in mind </p>
<p> When we talk about hyperuricemia, we’re not just talking about foods you can’t eat. There are other dietary steps and related aspects you can change to improve your situation: </p>
<p> It doesn’t help to have a weight higher than what is considered healthy. If you’re overweight, you should take measures for gradual weight loss. </p>
<p> You shouldn’t fast or extremely restrict your calories, since this can also increase your levels. </p>
<p> Stay hydrated. You should drink about 2 liters (8 cups) of water per day. </p>
<p> All of these steps should accompany your specific medical treatment laid out by a medical professional. </p>
<p> In summary </p>
<p> You should limit your consumption of red meat, fatty fish, sugary drinks, and alcohol, if you suffer from hyperuricemia. Eating in moderation, drinking a lot of water, and eating a diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, skim milk, and yogurt, will be a big help to combat this health problem. </p>

<p> Foods You Should And Shouldn't Eat After Breaking A Water Fast </p>
<p> So you've had exclusively water for quite some time and now it's breakfast — or break fast if it's not the morning. But what should you eat now? It's important not to reload your body with the wrong things, and it's also important not to reload the wrong way. Perhaps most importantly, though, you need to be aware that while there are some health benefits associated with water fasting, the risks and dangers can be quite high, including dehydration, worsening of medical symptoms, muscle loss, and other health concerns (via Healthline). </p>
<p> After a brief water fast, some ideal foods to eat for your first meal are: vitamin-rich juices, raw fruits and veggies, broths, fermented foods like unsweetened yogurt and kefir, leafy greens, starchy veggies like potatoes, and healthy fats like avocados, eggs, and coconut oil. These foods are easy to digest and packed with all sorts of nutrients your body needs after going without food. For your second meal you'd be wise to eat things like beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds, as well as meat and poultry (via VitaCost). </p>
<p> The dos and don'ts of breaking a fast </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> When coming out of a longer fast, it is recommended that you gradually add food back into the diet day-by-day. Livestrong suggests that on day one after a water fast, a blend of water and sugar-free juice high that's in vitamins can be consumed in the morning, and broth soups can be added the second part of the day. On day two, continue with liquids and add in some yogurts and dairy in the evening. On day three, eat fresh produce, soup, and dairy, then add in meats and eggs in the evening. On the last day, eat whatever you want, though you'll probably want to avoid junk food and the like, for obvious reasons. </p>
<p> There are some definite don'ts when beginning to eat again after a water fast. This is especially important if you are coming out of a long period of fasting (five or more days). There can be some serious health consequences for incorrect refeeding. It is recommended that before and after partaking in a long fast you check in with a doctor, as one of the most serious problems that can occur is an illness called refeeding syndrome, which can cause severe and dangerous effects to your heart, kidneys, nervous system and more (via Medical News Today). </p>
<p> What not to eat after a fast </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Fasting plans don't focus too much on what not to eat after the whole thing is over, but it's certainly not an excuse to binge on junk. Eating unhealthy, highly processed food, and foods high in sugar and fat will undo whatever health benefits you obtained from the process, plus could cause bloating and discomfort. It's always best to eat nutrient-dense, soothing foods in small portions as you ease back into a regular diet (via Healthline). </p>
<p> Furthermore, when you've been fasting for a longer period, your intestinal tract loses some of it's protective layers, leaving it more sensitive. It's important that fruit is not the first thing you eat. The sugar in fruit is difficult for your body to process and can irritate your gut, causing uncomfortable side effects. Protein shakes and dairy are also out as a first meal, because they too can irritate your vulnerable intestines. And lastly, cruciferous veggies are not a great option for the very first snack after a fast, because they basically encourage gas in your gut (via Hylete). </p>

<p> Food & Water </p>
<p> This article is about Food & Water in Subnautica. To see this subject's article on the Below Zero Wiki, click here. </p>
<p> Food & Water are categories of consumable items crafted from materials and creatures using the Fabricator. They are only available in Survival and Hardcore mode. Consuming Food & Water is required to maintain the player's Food & Water levels or else the player risks dying from thirst or malnutrition. </p>
<p> While some Food can be eaten raw, this action dehydrates the player and yields significantly less Food than when it is cooked. The player can also choose to cure fish instead of cooking them, so as to make them immune to decay. Cured fish has the same Food values as cooked fish, but dehydrates the player by -2 H2O. </p>
<p> To consume Food & Water items the player can left-click on the item in the PDA. </p>
<p> The two gauges are marked out of 100 but work slightly differently: the Water gauge never exceeds 100 under any circumstances, but the Food gauge will "overflow" above 100 if a consumed item's Food value would take it beyond 100, and it is not already 100 or higher. The maximum value for Food is therefore 174 (eating a Nutrient Block at 99 Food). </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> Starvation and Dehydration </p>
<p> A player will starve fully in about 50 minutes (1 unit of food every 30 seconds ) and so it is important to watch out, as not being cautious can mean death. </p>
<p> With dehydration, on the other hand, a player will die in about 33 minutes. (1 unit of thirst every 20 seconds) </p>
<p> In both cases, a player will be warned that they are close to starvation and/or dehydration when only 20 units of either food or water remain. Another warning will be heard when 10 units remain. </p>
<p> Rot and Decay </p>
<p> Cooked Food may raise the player's H2O levels, but it's also prone to rotting and decomposing. Curing fish instead of cooking them solves this problem but decreases hydration. Still, this is a preferable alternative for dealing with hunger when far from base or when local fish are sparse, as cured fish are the only kind of Food with any sort of long-term storage. Nutrient blocks, snacks, and gel sack also don’t rot, however, they can be rare and/or do not give ideal food levels. </p>
<p> Cooked Food slowly starts to lose its Food & Water value leading to Decomposition. The level will go as low as -25 H2O and -25 Food. During decomposition the Food amount lowers slowly; but when it reaches a certain level the Food becomes Ripe; Ripe Food eventually becomes rotten when it reaches -1 Food. It is recommended to eat the Food while you can during the early stages of decomposition as you will still gain some hunger. </p>
<p> Starts after: ~2-3 min. </p>
<p> Decomposing: ~2-3 min. </p>
<p> Ripe: ~13-18 min. </p>
<p> It is possible to store live fish in storage containers that will not rot until the player is ready to cook them. However, stored cooked fish will still rot regardless. </p>
<p> Note that decomposition also applies to plant Foods as well, and it is not possible to cook or cure them. While this means they cannot be carried around as a portable food supply, they can still be used for planting, or in the case of Creepvine, fabrication. Gel Sacks will never decay so they can be stored indefinitely while giving positive food and water. </p>

<p> Is It Safe to Eat Food That Has Freezer Burn? </p>
<p> It's time to settle the debate on whether you should scrape off the affected area or just toss the food out. </p>
<p> You can spot freezer burn the minute you see it—it's that mound of ice crystals that have seemingly fused onto your frozen blueberries and strawberries in the Ziploc bag, or on the top layer of your beloved, unfinished pint of ice cream, or to the corner of that piece of steak you've been saving. This blemish may cause you to draw the conclusion that the affected food is no longer edible, right? We turned to Natalie Rizzo, MS, RD, and author of The No-Brainer Nutrition Guide For Every Runner to set the record straight, once and for all. But before we dive into whether food with freezer burn is actually safe to eat or not, it may be helpful to identify what freezer burn is and why it appears, so let's start there. </p>
<p> What is freezer burn? </p>
<p> Freezer burn can either change the color of a particular food—most likely meat—or it can appear as a clump of ice crystals. You may have pulled out a raw chicken breast from the freezer before and noticed that a grayish-brown patch had formed on it. As Claudia Sidoti, head chef of Hello Fresh, told us in an article about storing chicken in the freezer, this discoloration occurs when the chicken is exposed to air, and as a result, becomes dehydrated. </p>
<p> Is it safe to eat food with freezer burn? </p>
<p> "According to the USDA, freezer burn just makes food dry because of air coming in contact with food," says Rizzo. "You can cut off spots with freezer burn, or you may want to discard the entire item if it's covered in freezer burn because it won't taste very good." </p>
<p> It all comes down to taste because it's completely safe to eat food that has freezer burn. However, cooking up a dried-out piece of steak will not taste nearly as satisfying as one that's fresh and tender. And do you really want to munch on that cluster of ice crystals just to get to the sweet ice cream that lies beneath it? Thankfully, there are preventative measures you can take to stop freezer burn in its tracks to begin with. </p>
<p> What causes freezer burn, and how do you prevent it? </p>
<p> "Freezer burn can happen to any food, but it's more likely [to occur] on foods that are left in the freezer for months. Also, if a food isn't properly stored, it's more likely to get freezer burn," explains Rizzo. "To properly store it, make sure it's wrapped tightly enough so that air can't get in. If you are putting it in a freezer bag, wrap it in plastic wrap first and then squeeze the air out of the bag, or store it in an airtight, freezer-safe container." </p>
<p> Rizzo also recommends letting hot food cool in the fridge for a few hours before packing it into the freezer. An expedited way to chill food would be placing the food into a small heat-resistant bowl and then putting that bowl inside of a larger glass one with half water and half ice. It's important to chill food before it goes into the freezer. Otherwise, this warm food could bring down the temperature in the freezer, causing nearby foods to partially thaw and then refreeze. This, in part, may cause the food's texture and even flavor to alter. </p>
<p> Also, be sure to keep your freezer tightly packed—not overflowing—to conserve energy and to ultimately help keep all of the foods in the freezer frozen. </p>
<p> Now, are you inspired to do a quick check of your freezer? Luckily, you can still eat those foods with freezer burn on them—and you've also learned how to avoid it in the first place! </p>

<p> Freshwater puffer fish food – Does it eat everything? </p>
<p> What is freshwater puffer fish food? Pufferfish are omnivorous animals, and they will eat a fairly varied diet. Puffers have four front teeth that converge and look like a beak. You need to put it into consideration when you care for a puffer fish. </p>
<p> The teeth form a sharp chopping machine, and they feed regularly. For their upkeep, you will need to feed them on hard shells of food to file them down and not allow it to stop growing. Puffers have an exciting personality, and they will learn to beg for food from their owners. </p>
<p> Puffers also have specialized requirements for their food. Some of the things that I found out about feeding of pufferfish after extensive research are listed below. </p>

<p> Puffer fish diet </p>
<p> Pufferfish diets comprise of algae and invertebrates, and large specimens can also crack and eat clams, shellfish, and mussels with their hard beaks. They are also able to synthesize their deadly toxin from the bacteria in the animals that they eat. </p>
<p> Behavior of pufferfish </p>
<p> In the wild, pufferfish are ferocious predators, and different species have different hunting techniques. Some of the open water hunters like the golden puffer and South American puffer who swims over rocky and sandy substrate searching for prey. </p>
<p> South American Puffer </p>
<p> Pufferfish like crested pufferfish and dwarf puffers are stealth predators. You will find then in overgrown riverbanks and places with various hiding spots where they can hide and attack their prey from the shadows. </p>
<p> Species like Congo puffers belongs to the group of ambush predators. This group will dig themselves in the sand while they wait for fish to come by so they can lunge upward and kill it. </p>
<p> Pufferfish are also aggressive to each other and other fish species. They are also fin-nippers as they will nip the fins of the fish that are kept with them. A unique behavior found in numerous pufferfish species is their ability to blow or spit water over the substrate to uncover prey. They will also spit water at you from the surface when they are hungry or for more food. </p>
<p> Puffer fish eats everything? </p>
<p> You will need to feed your puffers based on its size. If you are keeping small species, you will feed them daily. Mid-sized species can be fed every other day while the large species can be fed twice or three times a week. </p>
<p> Note: Avoid overfeeding them; they are also good at doing things that will impress you to earn more food. </p>
<p> Feeding Your Puffers </p>
<p> You do not have an excuse to feed your puffers with a poor diet. Many puffers have a diet which comprises of just crustaceans, shellfish, and hard-shelled foods like snails. The foods listed are a basic requirement when it comes to feeding puffers so that their teeth are constantly worn down to prevent its overgrowth. It means if you feed them with shell foods, you will not need to file their teeth yourself. </p>
<p> Note: some puffers rely more on the hard foods to wear down their teeth than other species. The hunter category of puffers seems to benefit more from eating this diet than the ambush category. However, there is usually some exception to this at times. </p>
<p> Types of freshwater pufferfish food </p>
<p> Freshwater puffer fish food are very from the frozen food to Freeze-dried food, or live food such as small shrimp. </p>
<p> Frozen food </p>
<p> You can offer varieties of food to your fish. The most common food to feed them is frozen food, and this is because you can easily store them. All you need is to keep the food frozen, and you will then thaw the food before you give it to your fish. Some of the frozen foods that you can feed them are krill, mussel, crabs, cockle, prawn, black worms, king prawn, bloodworm, etc. </p>
<p> Thawing of frozen food </p>
<p> There are different ways that you can thaw the food before you feed your puffers. Some people leave the frozen food to defrost overnight in the fridge while some defrost them with a cup of tank water. You can boil water and allow it to cool off before you pour it in a bowl that contains frozen food. Another way to thaw it is by enabling the feed to thaw with vitamin water. </p>
<p> After defrosting, it is best if you strain the water off before you feed your fish. If you have pre-packed frozen cubes like bloodworm, it is good advice to defrost, rinse, and strain them through a fine net. This method will make sure that you add only the food into the tank and nothing else that can cause an increase in the bio load in your tank. </p>
<p> Freeze-dried food </p>
<p> Freeze-dried food is another form of food for your pufferfish. You will need to soak freeze-dried food before you offer it to your fish. A great way is by using vitamin water for soaking them so that your puffer can get a healthy meal. Some of the freeze-dried foods for your puffers are plankton and krill. </p>
<p> Live food </p>
<p> You can also feed your puffers with live food, and you will find numerous live food to feed them. However, it would be best if you avoided feeder fish because they can cause problems for your puffer. It would be best if you kept in mind that not all puffers are piscivorous. By introducing feeder fish to them, they can contract diseases, and the diet is not going to be beneficial to them. Prolong feeding your puffer with fish can lead to issues like fatty liver and ultimately, death. </p>
<p> If you want to feed them with live foods, it is great if you can gut load them before you offer them. For instance, if you are offering a ghost shrimp, you can feed the shrimp on vegetation which the puffers can receive when they feed on them. </p>
<p> If you are going to harvest the live food yourself, you should take into consideration the area where you source for them. That is, you should source for your live food from the area that is free of fertilizers, pesticides, weed killers, and so on. </p>
<p> Feeding your fish with live food </p>
<p> You should ensure that you feed your freshwater puffers with live foods that are quarantined. It would be best if you tried to segregate the life feeder foods as they may make your puffers sick, and they also feed on prey animals like snails. Some of the live food that you can feed your puffers are crayfish, snails, shrimps, crabs, crickets, earthworms, blackworms, bloodworms, etc. </p>
<p> Note: When feeding your puffers, it is best to keep watch as much as possible. This will give you the chance to see if they are feeding well, and you can also remove the remaining food from the tank to prevent the deterioration of the water. It will also benefit your puffers if you can feed them with a varied diet. </p>
<p> What household food can pufferfish eat? </p>
<p> Crustaceans </p>
<p> You can feed your puffers with hard and crunchy food such as unshelled shrimp for their teeth. You can also feed them with crabs and shrimp, but they have a chemical known as thiaminase. Thiaminase interferes with the absorption of vitamin B1. You can quickly get around this by soaking the thawed crab and shrimp in B1 supplements. It is also best to feed them with these sparingly. </p>
<p> Bivalves </p>
<p> Your puffers will love cockles, clams, and mussels. One of the best foods that you can give your puffers is the mussels because they have thinner shells that puffers can crunch with their beaks. You can feed them whole to large puffers or dice them for smaller puffers. Mussels also comprise of thiaminase, but you can quickly soak them in supplements. </p>
<p> Frozen Fish </p>
<p> Pufferfish will appreciate frozen and fresh fish. If you want to feed them with frozen fish, you can shave off chunks with a cheese grater. You should avoid feeding them with oily species such as tuna and herring. Salmon is excellent for puffers as it is rich in carotenoids, which helps in maintaining the color of aquarium fish. It would help if you kept in mind that puffers need crunchy foods in their diet and should avoid feeding them with fish alone. </p>
<p> Squid </p>
<p> Squid is also a perfect pufferfish food that you can quickly get. You will need to chop the squids to size, and you can use a cheese grater to shave off chunks for frozen squid. Since squid has no crunchy parts, you will also need to feed your puffers crunchy foods. </p>

<p> Fruitarianism </p>
<p> Fruitarianism (/fruːˈtɛəriənɪzəm/) is a subset of dietary veganism, consisting of primarily fruits, and possibly nuts and seeds, but without animal products. Fruitarian diets are subject to numerous criticisms and health concerns. </p>
<p> Some fruitarians will eat only what falls (or would fall) naturally from a plant: that is, plant foods that can be harvested without killing or harming the plant.[2][3][4] These foods consist primarily of culinary fruits, nuts, and seeds.[5] According to author Adam Gollner, some fruitarians eat only fallen fruit.[6] Some do not eat grains, believing it is unnatural to do so,[citation needed] and some fruitarians feel that it is improper for humans to eat seeds as they contain future plants,[6] or nuts and seeds,[7] or any food besides juicy fruit.[8] Others believe they should eat only plants that spread seeds when the plant is eaten.[9] Others eat seeds and some cooked foods.[10] Some fruitarians use the botanical definitions of fruits and consume pulses, such as beans, peas, or other legumes. Other fruitarians' diets include raw fruits, dried fruits, nuts, honey and olive oil,[11] nuts, beans or chocolate.[12] </p>
<p> Some fruitarians wish, like Jains, to avoid killing anything, including plants,[10] and refer to ahimsa fruitarianism.[13] For some fruitarians, the motivation comes from a fixation on a utopian past, their hope being to return to a past that pre-dates an agrarian society to when humans were simply gatherers.[14] Another common motivation is the desire to eliminate perceived toxicity from within the body. For others, the appeal of a fruitarian diet comes from the challenge that the restrictive nature of this diet provides.[14] </p>
<p> According to nutritionists, adults must be careful not to follow a fruit-only diet for too long.[15] A fruitarian diet is wholly unsuitable for children (including teens), nursing mothers and their babies. Death can result from malnutrition.[16][15] </p>
<p> Fruitarianism is even more restrictive than veganism or raw veganism.[17] Maintaining this diet over a long period can result in dangerous deficiencies, a risk that many fruitarians try to ward off through nutritional testing and vitamin injections.[14] The Health Promotion Program at Columbia University reports that a fruitarian diet can cause deficiencies in calcium, protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, most B vitamins (especially B12), and essential fatty acids.[16] </p>
<p> Although fruit provides a source of carbohydrates, they have very little protein, and because protein cannot be stored in the body as fat and carbohydrates can, fruitarians need to be careful that they consume enough protein each day.[18] When the body does not take in enough protein, it misses out on amino acids, which are essential to making body proteins which support the growth and maintenance of body tissues.[18] Consuming high levels of fruit also poses a risk to those who are diabetic or pre-diabetic, due to the negative effect that the large amounts of sugar in fruits has on blood sugar levels.[19] These high levels of sugar mean that fruitarians are at high risk for tooth decay.[19] Another concern that fruitarianism presents is that because fruit is easily digested, the body burns through meals quickly, and is hungry again soon after eating.[14] A side effect of the digestibility is that the body will defecate more frequently.[14] Additionally, the Health Promotion Program at Columbia reports that food restrictions in general may lead to hunger, cravings, food obsessions, social disruptions, and social isolation.[16] The severe dietary restrictions inherent in a fruitarian regime also carries the serious risk of triggering orthorexia nervosa.[14] </p>
<p> Harriet Hall has written that a fruitarian diet "leads to nutritional deficiencies, especially in children. Fruitarians can develop protein energy malnutrition, anemia, and low levels of iron, calcium, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals."[20] </p>
<p> Vitamin B12, a bacterial product, cannot be obtained from fruits. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health "natural food sources of vitamin B12 are limited to foods that come from animals."[21] Like raw vegans who do not consume B12-fortified foods (for example, certain plant milks and some breakfast cereals), fruitarians may need to include a B12 supplement in their diet or risk vitamin B12 deficiency.[21] </p>
<p> In children, growth and development may be at risk. Some nutritionists state that children should not follow a fruitarian diet. Nutritional problems include severe protein–energy malnutrition, anemia and deficiencies including protein, iron, calcium, essential fatty acids, raw fibre and a wide range of vitamins and minerals.[22] </p>
<p> Some notable advocates of fruitarianism, or of diets which may be considered fruitarian, or of lifestyles including such a diet, are: </p>
<p> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, better known as Indian political and spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi, sustained a fruitarian diet for 5 years.[29] He apparently discontinued the diet and went back to vegetarianism due to pleurisy, a pre-existing condition, after pressure from Dr. Jivraj Mehta.[30][31] </p>
<p> Author Morris Krok, who earlier in his life lived "only on fruits",[33] allegedly advised against a diet of "only fruit",[34] although it was subsequently reported that Krok's diet consisted of "just fruit",[35] with dietary practices of fruitarians as varied as definitions of the term "fruitarianism". </p>
<p> Actor Ashton Kutcher was hospitalized and said that his "pancreas levels were completely out of whack" after following a fruitarian diet in preparation for his role playing Apple Inc. CEO and onetime fruitarian Steve Jobs, in the film Jobs. Jobs died of pancreatic cancer.[36] </p>
<p> The Order of the Golden Age published the journal Herald of the Golden Age (1896-1918), which promoted a "fruitarian system of living".[24] </p>
<p> The minor character Keziah in the 1999 film Notting Hill, (played by Emma Bernard) tells William "Will" Thacker (Hugh Grant) that she is a fruitarian.[40] She says she believes that "fruits and vegetables have feeling," meaning she opposes cooking them, only eating things that have "actually fallen off a tree or bush" and that are dead already, leading to what some describe as a negative depiction.[41] </p>

<p> The Best Time To Eat Fruit And Is It Before Or After A Meal </p>
<p> Fruits are not only tasty and easily available, but they are one of nature’s potent sources of vitamins, minerals and a host of other nutrients. Eating these super foods at the right time and with the right combination of other foods can go a long way in ensuring that your body fully absorbs all the vitamins, fiber, and healthy carbohydrates that it needs to function in good health. Ancient Ayurvedic texts are very descriptive on how to get the best out of fruits without causing unwanted side effects. </p>
<p> Eating Raw Fruits After Meals Causes Bloating, Gas, And Heartburn </p>
<p> Raw fruits contain rich fiber and simple sugars which require more time to be digested and absorbed. When taken after other foods (especially “digestion intensive” foods) this process is delayed and cause bloating, gas, heartburn, and other digestive problems, as the fruit ferments while waiting to be digested. </p>
<p> Advertisements </p>
<p> Eat Fruits In The Morning Or As Mid-Morning Snack </p>
<p> The best time to eat fruits is either first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, or as a mid-morning snack, in between breakfast and lunch (about 1 hour before a meal, or 2 hours after your meal). </p>
<p> Do Not Eat Fruit Before Bedtime </p>
<p> Avoid eating fruit close to bedtime as the sugar spikes up your energy and will keep you awake and alert. </p>
<p> Advertisements </p>
<p> Do Not Eat Fruit In Excess </p>
<p> Do not eat fruits in excess as fruits have their own calories that add to the other calorie dense foods to make it a double whammy and will backfire on your health. As other foods prevent fruits to be digested efficiently so also a fruit-based diet will prevent nutrition absorption from foods such as vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and low-fat dairy foods. </p>

<p> Should fruit be eaten before or after meals? </p>
<p> Fruits are an important part of a healthy and well-balanced diet. They are low in calories and fat but high in fiber. They also contain health-enhancing plant compounds such as antioxidants and they are filled with vitamins and minerals. </p>
<p> Experts recommend fruits for improving an individual’s overall well-being and helping prevent various diseases (heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke and some cancers). </p>
<p> Examples of healthy fruits include apples, blueberries, bananas, blackberries, cherries, pears, pineapples, oranges, kiwis and many more. Diets rich in nutrients typically include fruits because they help individuals sustain a healthy weight. </p>
<p> Commonly asked questions in regard to fruit </p>
<p> Should fruit be consumed before a meal or hours after a meal? </p>
<p> Should fruit be consumed on a full stomach or on an empty stomach? </p>
<p> One response in particular comes from a study published in the journal of ‘Endocrine, Metabolic & Immune Disorders -Drug Targets’. Fruit and its derivatives, such as fruit juice, contain polyphenols. Polyphenols have antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties that shield the body from free radicals and other molecules that cause inflammation. These “enemies” of the body are produced in large quantities just after eating an unbalanced meal, particularly food high in fat, carbohydrates or calories. </p>
<p> Citrus fruits after a fatty meal </p>
<p> It is not the first time that scientific research has dealt with the benefits of eating plentiful fruit after a meal. For example, a study at the University of Buffalo (United States) appeared in 2010 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, promoting the role of flavonoids in orange juice as “scavengers” in the body. Two antioxidants, naringin and hesperidin, neutralize the oxidative stress and inflammation generated by a unhealthy meal and prevent damage to the blood vessels. </p>
<p> “Naringin is a flavonoid found in grapefruit, lemon, oranges, clementines, tangerines, and cedar. This flavonoid is important for strengthening the capillary walls, purifying the body and promoting weight loss. It also has effect on the flu, acts as a muscle relaxant, it has anti-cancerous agents, hepatoprotection and anti-atherogenic mechanisms” – concludes Dr. Testa. </p>
<p> What kinds of fruit have a positive impact on postprandial stress? </p>
<p> “Fruits that best play an antioxidant role are purple fruits that fight free radicals responsible for cellular aging and inflammatory diseases. Among these fruits are blueberries, black plums, black grapes, blackberries and plums” – says Dr. Sara Testa, Nutritionist at Humanitas Hospital. </p>
<p> Is it better to eat fruit before or after meals? </p>
<p> “Preferably, fruit should be eaten before the two main meals because the fibers it contains help reduce the absorption of simple sugars, thus reducing the glycemic index of foods. Contrary to what is often recommended in weight loss diets, fruit in between meals stimulates the endogenous production of insulin and therefore stimulates hunger rather than reducing it” – explains Dr. Testa. </p>

<p> If you get a hunger pang, what better choice can you make than a piece of fresh fruit? But unfortunately, not all fruits are created equally. While they all have health benefits, some are healthier than others. And with some fruits, the drawbacks are actually worse than the benefits — talk about a buzzkill! You should be looking for fruit high in fiber and vitamins, and low in calories and sugar. If you don't, you may not be enjoying the healthy snack that you think you are. </p>
<p> If you're thinking about which fruits to use as staples in your diet and which to indulge in only occasionally (and yes, fruits can actually be considered indulgences), it's important to know the facts so you can make the best and healthiest choices for your body. </p>
<p> These are the fruits you should and shouldn't be eating. </p>
<p> Do eat: Pineapple </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> If you're looking for a tropical fruit packed with excellent health benefits, look no further than the pineapple, rich in vitamin C and manganese. The best reason to eat pineapple, however, is an enzyme called bromelain, which you can only get by eating this tasty fruit. </p>
<p> Bromelain helps you absorb antibiotics, stops diarrhea, and may even fight diabetes, heart disease and cancer, according to a study by Biotechnology Research International. It also shortens the healing time after surgery, and is used for treating inflammation and sports injuries. </p>
<p> If you're looking for ways to incorporate more pineapple into your diet, try putting it on your pizza, cutting up a pineapple and eating it as a snack, or adding it to your smoothies. You can also put in on your oatmeal, add it to beef tacos, or chop it up into some salsa. </p>
<p> Do eat: Blueberries </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> All berries have incredible health benefits, but blueberries take it to another level. One cup of blueberries contains 4 grams of fiber and only 15 grams of carbohydrates. In that cup, you'll also get 24 percent of your daily recommended vitamin C and 36 percent of the recommended dose of vitamin K. Due to their high fiber content, they'll fill you up without adding much to your caloric intake. </p>
<p> Blueberries have more antioxidants than most other fruit or vegetables, so grab a handful if you want to stay young longer. Antioxidants may reduce the effects of aging by counteracting damage to your DNA. </p>
<p> Studies have also found that blueberries can improve your memory, have anti-diabetic effects, and may reduce muscle damage after a rigorous workout. In addition, blueberries can help prevent urinary tract infections. </p>
<p> Want to eat more blueberries? Put them in your guacamole, mix up some delicious blueberry pancakes, or sprinkle them into your salad. </p>
<p> Do eat: Watermelon </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> There's a good reason you can find watermelon at most barbecues — not only is it delicious, but it also helps you stay hydrated, as it's 92 percent water. Watermelon boasts numerous other health benefits, including lowering blood pressure and helping with muscle soreness. Watermelon contains a wide variety of nutrients, including vitamin C, potassium, copper, vitamin A, and vitamin B5. </p>
<p> Watermelon's claim to fame, however, is the high level of citrulline you can find in the white part of the watermelon rind. In your body, citrulline turns into the amino acid arginine, which helps many of your internal organs, including your lungs and reproductive system. </p>
<p> If you're looking to eat more watermelon, try tossing it with feta cheese, making gazpacho, or layering it with mozzarella for a sweet caprese salad. Yum! </p>
<p> Do eat: Apples </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Apples are cheap, readily available, delicious, and healthy. They may be good for weight loss, as they contain a high percentage of water and are also high in fiber (there are 4 grams in a medium sized apple), so they fill you up without filling you with calories. One study found that subjects who had apple slices before a meal ate an average of 200 less calories during the meal. </p>
<p> Apples peels and flesh also contain polyphenols, a type of antioxidants that have been shown to reduce the risk of strokes and heart disease. There are five times more polyphenols in apple skin than in the rest of the apple, so don't throw that part out! </p>
<p> If you're wondering whether all apples have the same nutritional benefits, they don't. Skip the green apples and go for the red ones, as most of the polyphenols are found in red apple skin. </p>
<p> There's always room for more apples in your diet, and a million ways to cook with them. Add them to your sandwiches, make them into a tasty slaw, or add them to your bakes goods </p>
<p> Do eat: Grapefruit </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> You'll be surprised to learn how many nutrients are packed into grapefruit. Just half of a grapefruit contains 64 percent of your daily recommended vitamin C, as well as small amounts of protein, vitamin A, manganese, thiamine, folate, and magnesium. </p>
<p> In a 2006 study, researchers found that when participants ate half a grapefruit before each meal, they lost an average of 3.5 lbs in 12 weeks, most likely because of grapefruits' high fiber and water content. Plus, half a grapefruit contains only 52 calories, making it one of the lowest-calorie fruits. </p>
<p> Grapefruit also contains a large variety of antioxidants. One of these is lycopene, which has been shown to reduce the risk of cancer in a number of studies. Grapefruit contains flavonenes as well, which have anti-inflammatory properties. </p>
<p> Grapefruits are acidic and sour, so the idea of eating them raw may not appeal to you. In that case, try sprinkling them with mint leaves, honey, and a bit of salt. </p>
<p> Do eat: Avocado </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> As if you needed another reason to love avocado, let's take a look at some of the reasons you should be super excited about them. According to one study, an avocado not only contains high amounts of vitamin E, potassium, and iron, but they're also high in fat. Why is that good, you ask? Because it's monounsaturated fat, and it's the kind that helps lower your cholesterol. </p>
<p> There's more, too. The potassium in avocados helps manage blood pressure and fight fatigue, and they're also high in omega-3 fatty acids, which help you reduce the risk of heart disease. There's vitamins B6, C, and D, too, which your immune system needs to keep you healthy. Some of the types of fat in avocados have even been shown to help protect against certain types of cancers. </p>
<p> Avocados are high in calories — one can contain about 400 — but as a part of a healthy diet, they're a must. Try it for breakfast as avocado toast, or filled with an egg and baked. </p>
<p> Do eat: Lemons </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> In 1747, British researcher James Lind made history with some of the first controlled medical experiments ever conducted. He was trying to find a cure for scurvy, and found lemons worked so well that within a week, the patients he was treating were back on their feet (via the BBC). Today, we know why: A single lemon gives you 139 percent of your daily vitamin C. </p>
<p> LiveScience says that's not the only good thing there is about lemons, either. They're low-calorie, fat-free, and full of folic acid that's been shown to help protect against strokes and improve cardiovascular health. For anyone who's prone to kidney stones, they'll help you there, too. Half a cup of lemon juice a day has been shown to prevent the formation of stones, and studies have suggested, you're also helping your body protect itself against high cholesterol and even cancer. </p>
<p> Some claim lemons help aid in digestion, and while some nutritionists have debunked the idea lemons and lemon water help with weight loss, lemons are a great way to add flavor to water if you're trying to keep hydrated, no sugar needed. </p>
<p> Do eat: Kiwi </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Everyone suffers from a little bit of gastrointestinal distress sometimes, and it turns out there's a secret weapon in your fruit bowl that can make you feel better: the kiwi. Studies have found that the fiber present in kiwi has a massive impact on not only aiding digestion, but in improving how well your body absorbs nutrients. There's also evidence that it helps alleviate the pain of constipation, reduce bloating and discomfort, and increase overall gut health. </p>
<p> Studies from Massey University suggest it's an enzyme called actinidin that allows kiwis to be an invaluable addition to any diet. Thanks to the presence of that enzyme, regularly snacking on a kiwi will help make your entire digestive tract more efficient, from start to finish. And another study from the Taipei Medical University went even farther, finding that after adding kiwi to their diet for four weeks, participants who suffered from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) saw improvement in their symptoms. </p>
<p> Do eat: Jackfruit </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> You definitely don't have to be a vegetarian or a vegan to enjoy some meat-free meals, and if you're looking to expand your cooking repertoire to more fruit- and veggie-centric dishes, you should look into keeping jackfruit in your kitchen. </p>
<p> Jackfruit is some super weird stuff: according to the AP, it's catching on big-time as a meat substitute. That's because when it's not yet ripe, it can be shredded just like you'd shred pulled pork or chicken. The idea of fruit as the main component in a savory dish might sound weird, but it's got a neutral flavor, absorbs whatever seasonings you want to use, and has a texture that holds up. It's super versatile, too: use it in gyros or tacos, make some faux crab cakes, use it in dips or soups, or even pile it on pizza. Really! </p>
<p> And once it's ripened, it's still good: that's when you want to use it for dessert. </p>
<p> There's still more good news: it's good for you, too. Medical News Today says that jackfruit is full of vitamins and nutrients, and that it's also been found to help lower cholesterol, reduce blood pressure, and balance blood sugar levels. It even supplies the body with what it needs to maintain the health of skin, bones, and blood vessels. It's even full of good fiber that can help keep you regular. That's a lot of good stuff packed into this tropical fruit. </p>
<p> Do eat: Pomegranate </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> We know, we know... pomegranates are a pain. But you should definitely pick one up at the grocery store for a late-night snack, or even breakfast. Why? They're packed full of goodness. </p>
<p> According to the BBC's GoodFood, pomegranates contain about three times the amount of antioxidants that you'll get in either green tea or red wine. Studies have also suggested that pomegranates can help fight inflammation, and lower your blood pressure and risk of heart disease. When another study looked at whether or not a daily glass of pomegranate juice might help improve memory, results were promising. </p>
<p> Healthline calls pomegranates one of the healthiest fruits in the world, and that's a pretty big claim. The reason, they say, is that pomegranates contain two unique compounds: punicalagins and punicic acid. That's what gives them most of their health benefits, and it's possible there's still more to be discovered: pomegranates have even been linked to an increased success rate in fighting certain types of cancers. </p>
<p> Still wondering if it's worth it? Here's a tip to make getting all those seeds out easier: score the skin, and break the fruit into quarters. Submerge in a bowl, and start gently breaking it apart. The seeds will sink and the inedible pith will float. Easy peasy! </p>
<p> Don't eat: Bananas </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> You may want to think twice before eating a ripe banana for breakfast. Unlike some fruit, bananas contain mostly carbs. In fact, 93 percent of their calories come from carbohydrates. Also, they contain up to 16 percent sugar. </p>
<p> Unfortunately for ripe banana lovers, the healthy starches found in unripe bananas, which actually act more like fiber than carbohydrates, turn into sugar as a banana ripens. In the process, the banana becomes more and more sugary. </p>
<p> Instead of picking up a banana on your way to work, consider grabbing an apple or a grapefruit. They will fill you up without loading your bloodstream with sugar. Or, if you can't resist that banana, eat a smaller, greener one. </p>
<p> Don't eat: Mangoes </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Like bananas, mangoes have a larger percentage of sugar than other fruit, which is why they taste so sweet. One cup of mango contains 100 calories and 23 grams of sugar! With all of the fruits available that have a lower sugar content, you may want to stay away from mango, especially if you're trying to lose weight. </p>
<p> If you can't bear to cut them from your diet completely, eat them sparingly. For example, instead of making a mango smoothie, use a base of pineapple and put in a few small slices of mango for taste. </p>
<p> Don't eat: Cherries </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Due to their small size, cherries are also easy to scarf down by the dozen. But, like mangoes and grapes, cherries contain a higher sugar content than many other fruits. One cup of cherries contains 17.7 grams of sugar. This makes them a poor fruit choice for diabetics and dieters. </p>
<p> Also, because cherries are a high FODMAP fruit, they may make you bloated. FODMAPs are found in many fruits and vegetables and create gas and bloating because they're difficult to digest. </p>
<p> Instead of packing a bag of cherries to take with you to work, make a berry mix instead. That way you'll be satiated without the sugar overload and bloating. </p>
<p> Don't eat: Coconut </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Coconuts are in vogue right now, but they aren't as healthy as people want to think. In fact, one cup of shredded coconut contains a whopping 283 calories, 224 of which are from fat. This makes it one of fattiest fruits around. </p>
<p> Instead of putting shredded coconut on your oatmeal, consider sprinkling in some blueberries instead. Your waistline will thank you. </p>
<p> Don't eat: Cranberries </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> You've probably heard that cranberries and cranberry juice are the perfect, all-natural cure for a UTI, but according to the Journal of the American Medical Association, there's no evidence that cranberries actually make a difference when it comes to urinary tract health. The belief was that cranberries lowered the pH of urine, but recent studies have shown that the substance usually credited with doing this — hippuric acid — isn't present in high enough quantities to have any real impact. </p>
<p> In fact, consuming too many cranberries might actually increase your risk for certain types of kidney stones. Cranberries have a high amount of oxalates that can translate to an increased risk of calcium oxalate stones. There's another problem with cranberries, too. Not only are they extremely high in calories — a third of a cup contains about 123 calories and half a gram of fat — but many kinds of dried cranberries contain a huge amount of added sugar. That same third of a cup can have 26 grams of sugar, more than the 24 grams of daily sugar recommended for women. </p>
<p> Don't eat: Grapes </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Have you ever found yourself eating an entire bag of grapes in one sitting? They're so easy to pop into your mouth without giving them a second thought. And they're fruit, so they can't hurt anything, right? Unfortunately, grapes do have some negative side effects. </p>
<p> The negative effects of eating grapes include weight gain, carb overload (one cup of grapes contains 27 grams of carbs), gut issues, and allergy attacks. Turns out, this easy snack is not as harmless as you thought. </p>
<p> Don't eat: Oranges </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> But... but... but! You're probably already wondering why you should banish oranges from your life, and according to the University of Rochester Medical Center, it's because oranges are so acidic that they can do some serious damage to your teeth. Oranges — and orange juice — have been linked to not just decreasing the hardness of tooth enamel, but of eroding teeth so much that the enamel becomes roughened and more likely to erode even further. The damage they saw from oranges was similar to the damage done by sugary sodas, and you've probably heard plenty about just how bad those can be. </p>
<p> Affiliated Dentists lists oranges as being among the worst foods for your teeth, and they recommend that if you have to drink orange juice, you should use a straw to keep your teeth safe. </p>
<p> Don't eat: Lychee </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> The International Business Times reported on a partnership between Indian and US officials that solved the mystery of the illness plaguing the city of Muzaffarpur for more than 20 years. Every year, starting in May, some of the area's children would go from healthy to hospital overnight. There would be seizures and a loss of consciousness (via the BBC), around 40 percent of victims would die, and whatever was happening would stop in July. There were tons of theories, and it took a years and a major collaboration to determine it was lychees. </p>
<p> The first clue was that children with low blood glucose levels were more likely to die from the mysterious illness. Researchers confirmed lychees — particularly unripe ones — contain a toxin that keeps us from synthesizing glucose. That, in turn, leads to low blood sugar levels, and we all know that can cause some major problems. The children of Muzaffarpur (which produces about 70 percent of India's lychees), were filling themselves with lychees after skipping an evening meal, and it proved to be a deadly combination. If you're struggling with managing your blood sugar, give these a miss. </p>
<p> Don't eat: Limes </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> This is a tough one because on the surface, limes are good for you. They're full of vitamins, nutrients, and antioxidants, says Healthline, but they fall into our "don't eat" category because they come with a few very important footnotes. </p>
<p> Let's say you prefer to have your limes in an ice cold beverage, preferably while you're sitting outside enjoying a brilliantly sunny day. Healthline also warns that this can come with a nasty side effect: itchy rashes and second-degree burns. </p>
<p> How's that? Limes contain a chemical called furocoumarin, which reacts with sunlight. When it does, it gets absorbed into your skin, and the result is some pretty uncomfortable burns, blisters, and dark patches that could take months to heal and disappear. Skin damage, no matter where it comes from, is never, ever cool. </p>
<p> There's one other thing you should be aware of, too: limes can interfere with some medications. According to Pharmacist.com, limes inhibit the function of an intestinal enzyme called CYP-3A4, which plays an important role in the way medications are absorbed into the body. Bottom line? Check with your doctor before you enjoy your next lime. </p>
<p> Don't eat: Strawberries </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> No, say it ain't so! Strawberries are delicious and they're good for you, but there's a major catch: strawberries that come from major, large-scale producers are often terrible for the environment... and for the people who are working to grow them. </p>
<p> According to The Conversation, strawberries are a top crop in California. Unfortunately, in order to keep up with demand, farmers have started to rely on toxic chemicals and soil fumigants to keep their plants producing year-around. </p>
<p> Wait, what are soil fumigants? Before strawberries are planted, the ground is fumigated to get rid of pests in the soil. Think of it as similar to fumigating a building for, say, bed bugs. One industry favorite — methyl bromide — was banned when it was discovered just how much damage it was doing to the ozone layer, and another — methyl iodide — was pulled when it was discovered to be both a neurotoxin and a carcinogen. There are some chemical-free strawberry farmers out there, but only a small percentage are using methods that aren't destroying the natural balance of soil... or presenting a danger to those who are doing the spraying. </p>

<p> Full Body Rash After Eating </p>
<p> A full body rash that occurs after you eat is a serious sign of a severe allergic reaction. You need to call your doctor or 911 immediately to prevent further complications. Around 90 percent of all food allergies are related to fish, shellfish, soy, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, milk and eggs. If you’ve been diagnosed with a specific food allergy, such as an allergy to milk, you need to eliminate the allergen completely from your diet 1. Consuming even a small amount of the food can trigger a severe allergic reaction. </p>
<p> Is This an Emergency? </p>
<p> If you are experiencing serious medical symptoms, seek emergency treatment immediately. </p>
<p> Full Body Rash </p>
<p> A full body rash from eating is most likely hives. Hives are a common allergic skin condition that can appear within minutes of eating a food that causes an allergic reaction. The rash forms in one part of your body and spreads in a matter of minutes. Hives are very itchy and first appear like welts that can connect and form large patches or inflamed, red and swollen skin. A full body rash from eating is concerning because it is a sign that the allergic reaction is affecting your entire body. This can cause significant complications in your respiratory system, digestive system and cardiovascular system. </p>

<p> Cause </p>
<p> The entire body skin rash is caused by a systemic reaction that triggers the production of excessive amounts of antibodies and histamine. Your immune system reacts to the proteins in the food as if they are dangerous. Histamine protects the body from infectious diseases, but during an allergic reaction, excessive amounts of histamine cause inflammation. Inflammation in various parts of the body is what causes the entire body skin rash and other anaphylaxis symptoms. </p>

<p> The Dispute Over Food Sacrificed to Idols (1 Cor 8:1-11:1) </p>
<p> David E. Garland </p>
<p> George W. Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University </p>
<p> An insistence on exclusive loyalty to a religion was something uncommon in the great religious melting pot of the Hellenistic world. Tolerance and syncretism reflected the spirit of the times. People were accustomed to joining in the sacrificial meals of various deities, and none required an exclusive relationship.1 The prohibitions against idol food in Acts 15:20, 29 (cf. also Rev 2:14-17, 2:20) and Paul¡¯s long discussion in 1 Cor 8:1-11:1 suggest that the problem of food dedicated to an idol was not easily solved.2 Converts who turned from the worship of many gods and lords in their sundry guises were not so sure where to draw the line or if it was even necessary to draw the line when it came to food that had been sacrificed to idols as they tried to balance their identity as Christians with their assimilation to the highly competitive, pagan Corinthian culture. Dissociating themselves from all overtly idolatrous celebrations demanded of them an uncompromising devotion that could only invite ostracism from their unbelieving family and associates and lead to shame and material loss. The pressures have not changed for new Christians today living in cultures where food is regularly offered to one god or another. </p>
<p> The thesis of this paper is that, contrary to a popular reading of 1 Cor 8:1-11:1, Paul forbade Christians from any association with any food overtly connected to idolatry. He understands the Christian confession of one God and one Lord to require exclusive loyalty so that even a token or make-believe show of fealty to an idol compromises the loyalty owed only to God and Christ. Smit contends, ¡°Here we encounter an unmistakably Jewish Paul for whom the Shema is the basic rule of faith: Hear Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.¡±3 Paul¡¯s conversation with the Corinthians over this issue has been ongoing because some have resisted his prohibitions. Their recalcitrance necessitates his lengthy response. The argument is subtle. He does not immediately denounce their position but chooses a more circuitous route that winds its way through various facets of the problem turning it this way and that in an attempt to convince them to ¡°flee idolatry¡± (10:14). </p>
<p> His oblique argument has tended to throw off interpreters. Some have regarded the chapters to be a patchwork of interpolations, while others misread Paul¡¯s unequivocal rejection of anything explicitly connected to idols and assume that he made concessions and permitted supposedly innocuous, social dining in an idol¡¯s shrine. Neither view is correct.4 Paul creatively adapts the foundational Jewish confession that God is one by adding ¡°one Lord, Jesus Christ¡± (8:6).5 The upshot is that Christians may not consort with idols or even give the appearance that they do. Such restrictions were potentially onerous for converts since occasions for eating in connection with an idol or on the premises of an idol¡¯s temple were numerous. </p>
<p> Occasions for Eating Idol Food </p>
<p> The celebrations of many cults were closely bound up with civic and social life since religion and politics were indivisible in ancient Hellenistic city life. If Christians took part in civic life, they would have been expected to participate in a festival¡¯s sacrificial meals in some form of another.6 The imperial cult, which frequently combined state craft with stagecraft, was especially important to Corinthian citizens, and sacrifices were part of the Isthmian games.7 Winter concludes: ¡°Over-confident and weak Christians alike were in danger, such was the power of privilege and the importance of the imperial cult, and more so when it was established on a federal basis and celebrated in Corinth.¡±8 </p>
<p> Individuals who shared the same trades (cf. Acts 19:24-25) or a desire to worship specific gods banded together in voluntary associations (clubs, guilds). Many joined them for social reasons ¡°– a sacrifice to a god, an occasional meal, a drinking party, an exchange of different political views or a confirmation of shared ones.¡±9 In the Latin West, the poor formed funeral societies to celebrate a patron¡¯s memory and contributed to a common fund to insure that they would receive a proper burial. These associations ¡°served religious, social and commercial ends,¡± and some met in the dining rooms attached to major civic temples or their clubhouse might bear the name of a divinity.10 While the social and economic facets of the associations became increasingly important, Borgen notes, ¡°Religious activities always played a role at such gatherings.¡±11 This religious link explains why Philo (Drunkenness 14-15, 20-29, 95) vigorously opposed Jews joining associations because the lifestyle was characterized by gluttony and indulgence and necessitated not only breaking Jewish dietary laws but also eating idolatrous food.12 </p>
<p> Individuals might also receive invitations to a banquet at a temple since rooms could be rented out for private functions, like church halls today.13 Extant papyrus invitations beckon guests to attend banquets in a temple dining room commemorating a variety of rites of passage: weddings, childbirth, birthdays, coming-of-age parties, election victories, and funerals.14 Others were more overtly cultic feasts celebrating, for example, a god¡¯s birthday. </p>
<p> Willis claims that the meals in temples centered on conviviality and that any ¡°sacramental idea¡± was a later construct.15 He argues that if any sacrifice was involved, most participants would have dismissed it as a perfunctory and therefore meaningless convention. He underrates the religious overtones of such meals by overstressing conviviality. Conzelmann adopts a similar conclusion that Paul ¡°does not forbid the visiting of temple restaurants, which could be visits of a purely social kind.¡±16 The problem with this view is that neat distinctions between meals that involved overtly religious rites and those that were only convivial meals did not exist. The religious and the social functions were indissolubly bound together.17 The god or gods were honored by the meal and were conceived as present.18 Social meals in temples could not be purely secular or only nominally connected to idolatry since religious elements were always involved, even though opinion divided over what they meant. In the ancient world, people did not compartmentalize their religious, economic, or social lives, and it is anachronistic to think that they did.19 Schmitt-Pantel asserts that in the Greek city: ¡°Religion is present in all the different levels of social life, and all collective practices have a religious dimension.¡±20 It will not do to divide meals on temple grounds into those with social purposes, which Paul would have condoned, and those with religious purposes, which Paul would have prohibited. Gooch points to ¡°the ubiquitous use of hallowed food to celebrate socially significant events¡± and concludes that ¡°often the food (and fellowship) would be explicitly set apart as special by religious rite, and therefore – according to Paul – dangerous to eat.¡±21 Since Paul maintains in 10:28 that the food takes on a religious quality if a person says that it does and forbids Christians from partaking anything declared to be sacrificed to a god, he would not have sanctioned participation in anything idolatrous, even if it were only nominally idolatrous. </p>
<p> A second problem with Willis¡¯s interpretation is that the suggested ambiguity of the religious status of dining rooms in temples does not mitigate the problem of participating in banquets there. Even if sacred food were not consumed, the location of the banquet would cast its idolatrous shadow on the meal. Diners could not eat in such a place without a heightened consciousness of the gods.22 Gooch asks, for example, ¡°How could one eat in Demeter¡¯s sanctuary and not remember, or be reminded by word or symbol or ritual act, that the fruit of fertile ground was her gift?¡±23 </p>
<p> Christians might avoid overt associations with idolatry by declining to attend meals connected to idols and their shrines, but what were they to do when they were guests at someone¡¯s house and offered food sacrificed to an idol? They had colleagues, relatives, and patrons who were devotees of other gods and goddesses, and they would be put in socially awkward situations when invited to another¡¯s home and offered food that had been sanctified by an idol by a religiously minded host.24 Sacred food could be taken from the temple precincts and consumed at home, or religious rites could be performed over the food giving the meal a special character.25 Gooch points out: </p>
<p> Meals involving sacrifice in private homes were not occasions focusing exclusively on high religious ritual and demanding solemn religious dedication from participants, but they also were not simple common meals bracketed by habitual, formal and essentially empty rites. Rather they seem often to be meals of some social importance . . . They are meals where quantities are eaten, wine flows freely, and conviviality reigns – true meals and not simply ritual events. At the same time, the rites performed over the food were of significance: just as the occasions called for serious eating, they also called for authentic thanksgiving to the gods.26 </p>
<p> The issue Paul addresses in chapters 8-10 involves three different types of situations: (1) eating food sacrificed to an idol at the temple of an idol (8:7-13; 10:1-22); (2) eating food of unknown history that is bought in the market (10:23-27); and (3) eating food in the private homes of unbelievers (10:28-31).27 </p>
<p> An Internal Squabble between the Strong and the Weak? </p>
<p> An underestimation of the religious nature of meals at temple shrines has lead to a misunderstanding of the nature of the dispute Paul addresses. Many recent interpreters imagine that the Corinthians wrote to Paul to arbitrate an internal squabble between the ¡°strong¡± and the ¡°weak¡± who were of different minds regarding food offered to idols.28 As Murphy-O¡¯Connor frames it: ¡°One group had no doubts about the legitimacy of eating idol-meat, the other had serious reservations.¡±29 It is assumed that the ¡°strong¡± argued in the name of knowledge and freedom that they had the right to continue to eat idol food because idols had no existence. Many detect the propositions of the imagined ¡°strong¡± mirrored in Paul¡¯s responses: </p>
<p> ¡°All of us possess gnosis¡± (8:1) </p>
<p> ¡°An idol has no real existence¡±. . . because ¡°there is no God but one¡± (8:4) </p>
<p> ¡°Food will not bring us before God; if we do not eat we are not lacking and if we do we do not excel¡± (8:8) </p>
<p> These conjectured slogans may have been combined with another, ¡°All things are permissible¡± (6:12, 10:23), to reach the conclusion that eating food offered to the idols of gods that did not exist could pose no danger to Christians. It is then surmised that the ¡°strong¡± reasoned: ¡°What does not exist cannot contaminate us. Therefore, we are free to participate in these banquets if we so wish.¡± </p>
<p> This dominant view assumes that the ¡°weak¡± Christians felt neither so free nor so bold. They were converted pagans – Jews could not be described as ¡°until now accustomed to idols¡± (8:7) – and their past associations of the sacrificed food with pagan rites and shrines were simply too strong for them to eat in good conscience. They did not have the strong¡¯s liberating knowledge in their emotions and sensibilities but felt pressure from the strong to imitate them and not be so squeamish or sanctimonious. Some contend that the so-called ¡°strong¡± castigated their more scrupulous brothers and sisters as the ¡°weak¡± in their letter to Paul and sought to raise their consciousness by encouraging them to attend meals in pagan temples and to consume the idol food.30 By caving in to this pressure, however, the weak violated their own conscience. They ate idol food but were not yet fully convinced it was permissible.31 The letter to Paul from the ¡°strong¡± tries to enlist his support in urging the weak to get with it and ¡°enter the world of spiritual freedom enjoyed by those who possess gnÇsis.¡±32 </p>
<p> This view assumes that Paul agreed theologically with the ¡°strong¡± (10:19, 25, 27) but introduced a catch they failed to consider. On the one hand, he concurs that they were technically correct that consuming idol food per se was a matter of indifference for a Christian. He makes no attempt to controvert the slogans of those convinced of their freedom in Christ to eat anything they chose anywhere they liked. On the other hand, he reproaches them for being under-enlightened – they know but not as they ought to know (8:2) – and under-empathic toward the delicate consciences of the weak. They do not love and consequently disdain and bully the Christian brothers and sisters who were still influenced emotionally by years of conditioning regarding the temples and the gods (8:7). This view assumes that Paul is not vexed by their consumption of idol food in idol settings but by their lack of consideration for their fellow Christians. While the ¡°strong¡± were certainly correct that eating is morally neutral and makes one neither better nor worse spiritually (8:8), he insists that under certain conditions eating has a moral dimension and can become a sin against Christ (8:12). </p>
<p> Instead of urging the ones with the scruples to quit being so uptight over nothing, as the ¡°strong¡± Corinthians hoped he would do, this traditional view assumes that Paul directs his words to the so-called free ones with knowledge. He instructs them to be radically free (8:9). If they are radically free, they will never allow their freedom to ruin a fellow Christian whose conscience is weak (8:9-13). Many read Paul¡¯s advice in Rom 14:23 into this situation. The weak person may be induced to ¡°go along¡± with the crowd, that is, to participate in feasts without being fully persuaded that it was sanctioned by God. Since Paul believed that whatever does not proceed from trust is sin (Rom 14:14), when the weak do not eat idol food out of knowledge or a sense of freedom but out of a fear of being ridiculed, they are guilty of sin. According to this view, Paul did not object to the ¡°strong¡± eating idol food because it comprised some inherent religious danger but because it caused the weak to take offense or to violate their conscience. His only concern is that the ¡°strong¡± be more sensitive and cautious and show more Christian charity to their less progressive brethren. He instructs them to restrict their freedom because of their bonds with their fellow Christians who were weak. Willis, for example, concludes: ¡°One must always forego eating when another person is thereby endangered. At no time is eating right ¡®in itself,¡¯ but all eating and drinking – indeed, everything one does (10:31!), is subject to this criterion of consideration of the other person.¡±33 The corollary would seem to be that as long as no one is offended or compromised, eating idol food is not sinful and therefore is permissible. Concern for the welfare of the fellow Christian becomes the key for deciding what is right or wrong. </p>
<p> Brunt contends that Paul does not simply give an answer to the question but shifts the focus to Christian love, ¡°and in doing so he presents an example of principled, ethical thinking where love and respect for others transcends the rightness or wrongness of the act itself.¡±34 He believes that Paul¡¯s main concern is not getting the Corinthians to avoid behavior that may be construed as idolatrous but getting them to live out the basic Christian principle: ¡°Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor¡± (10:24).35 He therefore tries to persuade ¡°the strong¡± that the scruples of weaker Christians are not obstacles that stifle their freedom in Christ but opportunities to exercise their freedom. </p>
<p> This view also assumes that the church¡¯s later treatment of the problem of idol food failed to grasp Paul¡¯s sophisticated hermeneutic and vision and reverted back to Jewish legalism by demanding abstinence from idol food. For example, Barrett maintains that the next generations could see no way of excluding idolatry that did not include rigid abstention from heathen food and heathen dinner parties . . . The church as a whole retreated into a narrow religious shell. Jewish Christianity (in this matter) triumphed though Jewish Christians became less important in the church.36 </p>
<p> Brunt avers that the other extant sources of Christianity speak only to the question of the rightness or wrongness of the act itself and failed to comprehend Paul¡¯s reflective ethical approach to the problem that focused only on one¡¯s responsibility to others.37 </p>
<p> A Dispute Between Paul and the Corinthians </p>
<p> The hypothesis that a dispute raged between ¡°strong¡± and ¡°weak¡± Corinthians does not bear careful scrutiny. Paul never identifies any particular group as ¡°the strong.¡± He never addresses the weak and only describes them in the third person as reasons for giving up what one considers to be a right.38 There is no indication in the text that the ¡°strong¡± are trying to bend the will of the weak to see things their way. On the contrary, the weak person in Paul¡¯s scenario only happens by coincidence to see the strong reclining in a temple (8:10).39 He does not suggest that this person recoils in pietistic horror upon observing his fellow Christian dining in an idol¡¯s shrine but instead worries that he might be drawn back into idolatry by emulating the example of those reputed to have knowledge. What he fears is not factionalism in the church over this issue or that the weak person might act contrary to their beliefs but that he might be reeled back into idolatry. The basic issue has to do with what Paul regards as forbidden idolatrous behavior by those who perceive themselves as endowed with liberating knowledge. </p>
<p> Interpreters mistakenly have read the idea that the church was split over the idol food issue into the text from Paul¡¯s concern over factions voiced in 1 Cor 1-4 and from his seemingly analogous discussion of a dispute over food in Rom 14:1-15:13.40 Both Romans and 1 Cor 8-10 deal with the issue of how what one eats effects others. In both passages Paul cautions against causing another to stumble (Rom 14:13, 15, 20-21; 1 Cor 8:13; 10:32) and destroying another (Rom 14:20; 1 Cor 8:11). In both passages he mentions the weak (Rom 14:1, 2; 15:1; 1 Cor 8:7, 9, 10, 11, 12; 9:22). He also raises the question of your ¡°good¡± being spoken of as evil (Rom 14:16; 1 Cor 10:30). Paul¡¯s solution in Rom 15:2, ¡°Each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor,¡± matches his exhortation in 1 Cor 10:24, ¡°Let no one seek his own advantage but that of another.¡± The appeal to the example of Christ in Rom 15:3 corresponds to his conclusion in 1 Cor 11:1, ¡°Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.¡± </p>
<p> These parallels have misled interpreters to think that the ¡°weak¡± in 1 Cor 8 have the same problem as the ¡°weak¡± in Rom 14-15. Several differences, however, emerge from a careful reading.41 (1) In 1 Cor 8-10 the central issue is food sacrificed to idols ei)dwloqu/ta (8:1, 4, 7, 10; 10:19, 28 [i(ero/quton]). The issues in Rom 14-15 concern meat or vegetables (14:2) or what days to regard as holy (14:5), and Paul never mentions idol food or says anything about the context in which the food is eaten. Questions about food being ¡°clean¡± or ¡°unclean¡± (Rom 14:14, 20) are matters of kashrut. Idol food, which is intended and known to be offered to an idol, can never be clean. </p>
<p> (2) Paul never refers to ¡°the strong¡± (Rom 15:1) in 1 Cor 8-10, and ¡°the weak¡± are identified as ¡°weak in consciousness¡± (1 Cor 8:7).42 The problem in Rom 14-15 is a weakness in faith (Rom 14:1, 22, 23), not a weakness in conscience. The word ¡°conscience¡± (1 Cor 8:7, 10, 12; 10:25, 27, 28, 29) never appears in Rom 14-15, and the word ¡°faith¡± does not appear in 1 Cor 8-10.43 </p>
<p> (3) In 1 Cor 8:9 (cf. 9:4-6, 12, 18), the key word is e)cousi/a, which does not appear in Rom 14-15. </p>
<p> (4) In Rom 14-15, Paul clearly sides with the ¡°strong¡± (Rom 14:20: ¡°for everything is indeed clean¡±), and he sees no harm in their eating except for its potential effect on the ¡°weak.¡± He warns against passing judgment on others with scruples (Rom 14:1-13a). They could pressure the ¡°weak¡± to conform and be guilty of sin in their own minds (Rom 14:13b-23). By contrast, in 1 Cor 10:14-22, Paul brands their actions as a deadly communion with demons. He only agrees that the ¡°weak¡± do not have ¡°this knowledge¡± but does not offer any hint that their ¡°scruples¡± – if that is the proper word – are ¡°backward¡± or ¡°unnecessary.¡± In Rom 14:5-6, Paul says that both the one who eats and the one who abstains give thanks to God and honor God. Can food that is publicly disclosed as offered to an idol be blessed and bring honor to God? Paul¡¯s directive in 1 Cor 10:28 not to eat food that someone openly declares has been offered in sacrifice suggests not. </p>
<p> Romans 14:1-15:6 has to do with the social interaction between Jewish and Gentile Christians. 1 Corinthians 8:1-11:1 has to do with idol food and associations with idolatry – the interaction between Christians and idol worshipers. It does not follow that since Paul rejected Jewish food laws that erected barriers between Jews and Gentiles he condoned the eating of idol food. Idol food is a different matter entirely that introduces the baleful influence of syncretism and polytheism. Because Paul rejected narrow Jewish restrictions that separated Jewish Christians from Gentile Christians does not mean that he rejected restrictions involving idolatry that separated Christians, who were exclusively tied to the one true God, from idolaters, who related to many gods and lords. It is more reasonable to conclude that Rom 14-15 is an adaptation of principles found in 1 Cor 8:1-11:1 to a quite different situation. Consequently, Rom 14:1-15:6 should not be read into the Corinthian context. It is mistaken to assume that, as Paul was in theological agreement with the ¡°strong¡± in Romans, he also agreed with the so-called ¡°strong¡± in 1 Cor 8 and only wanted them to be more charitable to their theologically challenged brothers and sisters. </p>
<p> When Rom 14:1-15:6 is not read into the text, a careful reading of 1 Cor 8:7-13 does not suggest that the Corinthians were knocking heads over the idol meat issue and appealed to Paul to hold court on the matter. Hurd claims instead that the Corinthians were united on the issue of idol food and that Paul¡¯s response in these chapters was another installment in the continuing saga of his disagreement with them.44 The proudly enlightened Corinthians wrote to Paul defending why they believed they could continue their practice of associating with idol food. According to Hurd, the Christian with the weak conscience is only a hypothetical person conjured up by Paul as part of his argument to convince the Corinthians </p>
<p> Hurd and Fee help correct the mistaken view that 8:1-11:1 comprise Paul¡¯s first word to the Corinthians on the subject of idol food.45 It is inconceivable that this letter would be the first time that Paul ever discussed that issue with the Corinthians. Idolatry would have been one of the earliest and most pressing issues confronting new converts anywhere many gods and lords exist (cf. 1 Thess 1:9-10; Gal. 4:8-9; 1 Cor 12:2; Acts 14:15; 17:16; 19:11-40).46 Such a vital issue – whether Christians may or may not eat food sacrificed to idols or eat in idol temples – would not have been something that suddenly dawned on the Corinthians months later after the weak objected to ¡°the strong¡¯s¡± exercise of their freedom. It is much more plausible that the Corinthians have engaged in an ongoing discussion with Paul about this matter, and some of them have not welcomed his prohibitions.47 </p>
<p> Barrett is quite wrong in his assertion that ¡°Paul was not a practising Jew¡± when it came to food sacrificed to idols.51 The anti-Judaism of Weiss is glaring when he comments that the enlightened Paul rejects the superstition and fearfulness of Judaism regarding idol food.52 Paul had not become so ¡°unjewed¡± that he tolerated things that overtly smacked of idolatry. For him, the issues concerning Jewish purity and impurity laws were entirely different from the issues concerning idolatry.53 His rejection of idol food would fully accord with his Jewish background with its ¡°long tradition of polemic against pagan cults.¡±54 </p>
<p> Hurd is correct. The Corinthians were not asking, ¡°Can we eat idol food?¡± but ¡°Why can¡¯t we eat idol food?¡± and it is understandable why the dispute arose. Corinthian converts came from a quite different cultural heritage and might have downplayed any religious ceremony solemnizing a dinner party in a pagan temple as a bunch of religious mumbo jumbo that had no spiritual effect on them. The chief reason for their participation would have been the intense social pressure from their polytheistic culture. They are not exercising theological bravado and demonstrating their spiritual security and liberty by deliberately eating what had been offered to idols. They quite naturally did not want to give up their family and social connections, so they made compromises and probably justified them post hoc.55 Philo (Spec. Laws 1.28-29) complains about the attraction of idolatry even for Jews steeped in their monotheistic faith. Rabbinic literature testifies to the lure of pagan society with the idolaters coaxing, ¡°Come and intermingle with us¡± (Mek. Shirata 3 to Exod 15:2). It is not surprising that newly converted Christians would have bent under this significant pull to compromise with idolatrous practices, and we need not assume they did so with theological deliberation. Yeo puts it in a modern Chinese perspective: ¡°To advise the Chinese not to offer food and not eat the food in ancestor worship may be implicitly advising them not to love their parents, not to practise love, and ultimately not to be Chinese.¡±56 </p>
<p> Joining in meals was extremely important in the ancient world because they served as markers of socio-economic class divisions, as opportunities to converse and build friendships, and as a means to fulfill socio-political obligations. Anyone desisting from public sacrificial events was unfit for political functions.¡±57 To shun gatherings that lubricated social and economic relations would make Christians conspicuous outcasts who held outlandish, anti-social, perverse religious beliefs.58 More prominent Corinthian Christians would have been reluctant to draw hard and fast lines that would alienate such important persons in their lives and exclude them from society.59 Willis thinks it most probable that ¡°those who ate simply were unwilling to remove themselves from normal social life.¡±60 </p>
<p> In these chapters, Paul responds to the Corinthians¡¯ resistance. He is fully aware of the intense pressure to join in the hale-fellow-well-met conviviality, but he maintains that no temptation has overtaken them that is not common to humans (10:13). He insists that God is faithful and will not allow them to be tempted beyond what they can withstand. </p>
<p> A major error of the traditional view is the weight it places on Paul¡¯s warning about the potential harm that eating idol food might cause a Christian with a weak conscience. It assumes that this was Paul¡¯s only problem with eating idol food. The subtle nuances of Paul¡¯s argumentation contribute to this misunderstanding. Understanding chapters 8-10 as Paul¡¯s reaction to a previous protest from the Corinthians helps shed light on why his arguments may seem to be so complex and circuitous to modern readers.61 The confusion may be caused by the fact that he did not start his argument by condemning outright the behavior as presumably he had done in his previous discussion on this issue. Paul was interested in persuasion, not coercion.62 He did not pass off eating of idol food, with full awareness of its idolatrous connections, as a matter of indifference. It is a dangerous, sinful act since Paul explicitly links idol food to idolatry in 10:19-20 and never says, ¡°Eat idol food as long as the weak are not caused to stumble.¡± He allows one to eat any food bought in the market or offered in another¡¯s home without asking its origins or history. If one somehow were informed that the food was idol food, then Paul insists that one must abstain. </p>
<p> Because the Corinthians did not yield to Paul¡¯s prior objection to idol food, he recognizes that a lengthier, more subtle approach is demanded. Yeo is correct that Paul did not attempt to give an easy answer of ¡°yes¡± or ¡°no¡± in 1 Cor 8 and that he did not resort ¡°to absolute prohibitions concerning idol meat eating.¡±63 But he does not understand why this is the case. It was not because the situation was too complex for a simple solution. Paul adopts this tack because he intends, as he does throughout the letter, to exercise love in directing them. He wants them to flee from idols (10:14), but he also wants them to see the theological implications of their behavior and the necessity of the norm of love for guiding all their behavior. Consequently, he employs indirect means.64 </p>
<p> How Paul¡¯s Argument Against Idol Food Works: I. Introduction and Refutation of Their Practice Because of its Danger to Fellow Christians (8:1-13) </p>
<p> Wright correctly recognizes that the ¡°major issues at stake were monotheism, idolatry, election, holiness and how these issues interacted.¡±65 Paul begins his counter-argument in 8:1-6 by going back to first principles, ¡°the reassertion of Jewish-style monotheism,¡± something the Corinthians would readily accept. He does not draw out, however, the full implications of what their monotheistic confession and allegiance to one God entail until 10:1-22.66 He introduces the dispute over idol-food by establishing common ground: We Christians know that God is one and that idols have no existence despite their many adherents. He builds on this consensus about the non-existence of idols to introduce two key principles that will inform his argument. First, Christian love is to override knowledge that feeds arrogance. Second, Christian monotheism defines who the people of God are as distinct from those who worship many gods and lords. </p>
<p> The second principle undergirds all that Paul says against eating idol food, but he develops the first principle in this unit. Mentioning Christ in the confession in 8:6 recalls God¡¯s supreme act of love that made Christians a unique people. Christ died for them (8:11). This act of love that brought them into God¡¯s family requires that they respond to others in the family with love – putting others¡¯ needs and interests ahead of their own. In 8:7-13, Paul explores the potential effect of the ¡°knowers¡± eating idol food on a fellow believer who may not have the same level of theological sophistication to rationalize such behavior or to apprehend its theological consequences. He assumes that as Christians they have a loving concern for others and do not wish to lead them into sin. His first argument against eating idol food is his assertion that their actions are not neutral but may cause another Christian to stumble and fall. </p>
<p> He presents the hypothetical example. The emphasis is on ¡°if¡± – if a fellow Christian observes another Christian, esteemed as a person of knowledge, eating food in an idol setting (8:10). The other Christian is identified as programmed by habituation to think in certain ways about sacrificed food and as having a ¡°weak conscience.¡±67 The conscience is not ¡°the inner voice which warns us that someone may be looking,¡± as the American humorist journalist H. L. Mencken defines it. Paul uses the term to refer to that faculty of moral evaluation that adjudicates whether an individual¡¯s actions are right or wrong and directs behavior according to recognized norms. It is a moral compass. A panel from the American cartoon Dennis the Menace unexpectedly captures what Paul means. Consigned to sit in a corner as punishment for some misbehavior, he reflects: ¡°I got some bad advice from my conscience.¡± The conscience comprises the depository of an individual¡¯s moral beliefs and principles that makes judgments about what is right and wrong.68 A ¡°weak¡± conscience is one that is unable to make appropriate moral judgments because of a lack of proper edification. Eriksson points out that ¡°weakness¡± was used in the philosophical schools for ¡°the moral sickness suffered by those recent converts who were not yet able to make correct moral judgments¡± (cf. Epictetus, Diatr. 2.15.20).69 A ¡°weak¡± conscience is prone to give assent to false judgments and to sanction actions based on faulty criteria, particularly when it has been defiled. It is untrustworthy because it does not possess the necessary knowledge.70 </p>
<p> The Christian with a weak conscience does not have the knowledge to make correct moral judgments. Paul worries that this person might follow the example of those presumed to have knowledge but eat idol food as truly offered to an idol, that is, as a sacrificial act. He will be led astray in his moral judgment to think that it is permissible for Christians to pay homage to both Christ and pagan deities.71 His conscience is then ¡°defiled¡± through idolatry (cf. Rev 3:4), which is akin to a compass becoming demagnetized so that it no longer points to true north. </p>
<p> Paul is anxious that the Christian in this example will be sucked back into the vortex of idolatry and face spiritual ruination. He concludes with a hyperbolic example of what he would do to avert such a catastrophe. He would abstain from eating meat altogether (8:13). Love may require giving up things that one regards as a right for the sake of preventing other Christians from falling. But this principle is not Paul¡¯s final word on the matter. It is simply his opening salvo that asks the Corinthians to consider aspects of the problem they had overlooked. </p>
<p> II. Paul¡¯s Own Example to Undergird His Counsel (9:1-27) </p>
<p> The choppy transition from the discussion of idol food in chapter 8 to the right of an apostle to receive aid from a congregation has caused some to suspect that the section beginning in 8:13 or 9:1 represents an interpolation72 or an unconnected digression.73 Most now recognize that this section is integral to Paul¡¯s argument about idol food and takes it a step further.74 In 9:1-27, Paul develops the example of his own behavior. Everything he does, including not exercising his rights as an apostle, is aimed at winning others to the gospel and avoiding anything that might needlessly hinder another from coming to faith. </p>
<p> Some contend that Paul is defending himself against the winds of criticism shaking the Corinthians¡¯ confidence in his apostleship, something that surfaces in 2 Corinthians. His exclamatory question, ¡°Am I not an apostle?¡± (9:1), sounds defensive; and his statement, ¡°This is my defense (a)pologi/a) to those who would examine me¡± (9:3, nrsv), seems plain enough to support this view. It may seem that Paul unleashes a torrent of rhetorical questions that vigorously defend his apostolic right to receive support in response to his detractors who suggested that he did not have that right. He then offers his rationale for having waived that right. Rhetorical questions, however, do not indicate that the writer has adopted a defensive mode. They simply invite the audience to give its opinion.75 They are part of Paul¡¯s style in this portion of the letter; six occur in 10:14-22 (cf. also 8:10, 10:30).76 </p>
<p> It is unlikely that Paul is on the defensive in this unit. First, the notion of his apostleship only appears in 9:1-2 in which he establishes his right to earn material support. These remarks are too brief for a substantive defense. The rest of his argument appeals to the everyday examples of the soldier, farmer, and shepherd (9:7), the plowman and thresher (9:10), and the priest (9:13). These illustrations simply point to ¡°the universal norm that every person ought to profit from his labour.¡±77 The authority of the law (9:8-10a; Deut 25:4), the precedent of others who already have received benefactions from the Corinthians (9:12a), and the command of Jesus (9:14) further buttress the right of an apostle who labors in the gospel to earn his living from the gospel. These arguments do not furnish support for Paul¡¯s apostolic standing but simply remind readers what everybody knows and establish the point that apostles have the right to be supported. </p>
<p> Second, rhetorical questions that could just as easily be answered negatively would hardly win the day in a defense. Apparently, Paul did not expect the Corinthians to contest the points because he phrased the first four questions in 9:1 to expect an affirmative answer.78 The question, ¡°Am I not an apostle?¡± does not challenge any misgivings about his apostolic rank but instead establishes at the outset the premise of his discussion. He is entitled as an apostle to receive support, as they must admit, but they know he has waived those rights. He is not asserting rights in this section but hammering home his renunciation of them! His statement in 9:15 that he does not write to secure his due rights for financial backing assumes that they would pay him if he would accept it. </p>
<p> Third, if the Corinthians did not regard him to be a true apostle, he wastes his time describing at length his refusal to use his rights as an apostle. The key assertion comes in 9:19 where he maintains that he is free from all men (cf. 9:1) – not that he is an apostle.79 </p>
<p> Fourth, Kistemaker inadvertently highlights a problem with the view that Paul is on the defensive with these comments: ¡°We would have expected Paul to provide further details [about the opponents] (compare, e.g., Gal 1:6-7; 5:10), but conclusive evidence is lacking.¡± ¡°We lack sufficient information about specific charges Paul¡¯s opponents are leveling against him.¡±80 The most obvious reason for the paucity of details is that there were none to give. No one in Corinth was raising charges against him related to his refusal to receive support. </p>
<p> Fifth, the focus of this section falls on rights and the waiving of rights (e)cousi/a, 9:4, 5, 6, 12, 18; tou/twn, 9:15). It develops the issue of e)cousi/a raised in 8:9. Paul¡¯s development of the theme in 9:19-23 further explains that he sets aside his own advantages for the sake of others. The argument in this section establishes his high status to set the stage for his willing acceptance of low status. Martin comments, ¡°Low-status persons, the weak, by definition have no exousia to surrender.¡±81 The things connected with high status, rights and freedom, are the very things that those who have them recoil at surrendering. This is Paul¡¯s point. The overall argument is intended to promote a certain kind of demeanor and conduct. Having established his rights, he can then feature his refusal to profit from them. </p>
<p> Finally, it is a strange defense of his apostleship for Paul to point out several respects in which he has not acted like an apostle. Why cite a command of the Lord (9:14) that seems to undermine his position? If the problem is that some have disparaged him for failing to live according to the standard ordained by Jesus, Paul says nothing to offset this perception. The best answer to these questions is that Paul is not on the defense and not insisting on his apostolic rights. Instead, he insists that renouncing these apostolic rights is the right thing to do for one captured by Christ. He is controlled by necessity to win others to Christ that his calling as an apostle imposes upon him, not by any selfish desire to promote his own advantage or to indulge his own fancy. His cites his own practice as an example of the attitude he wants them to adopt. The task of advancing the gospel totally dominates his life, inspiring his willingness to make any sacrifice to win others. He wishes that this attitude was more evident in their lives. </p>
<p> That Paul intends in this section to offer himself as a model of one who voluntarily relinquishes his rights is confirmed by the athletic metaphor that spotlights his own conduct (9:24-27) and the concluding admonition to imitate him as he imitates Christ (11:1). He uses autobiographical information to establish ethos to persuade.82 Holladay notes that using ethical paradigms was typical of Greco-Roman moralists who believed that ¡°example was far superior to precept and logical analysis as a mean of illustrating and reinforcing appeals to pursue a particular mode of life, normally the life of a)reth/ (virtue).¡±83 They would present themselves as paradigms for their audience to follow. Paul¡¯s personal example as an apostle, who unselfishly sacrifices for others in his missionary service, is particularly appropriate for the Corinthians who have demonstrated a tendency to seek their personal gain. By contrast, the Corinthians appear to insist on a right that might cause the weak to stumble. Paul purposefully surrenders a right and adapts himself to the weak (9:22) and to others to win them. The implication is that those with knowledge should follow his example by abdicating their so-called right to eat idol food (8:9) so that they would avoid any possibility of causing others without their endowment of knowledge from falling back into idolatry. The issue of food appears in 9:4, 7, 9, 10, 13 and reveals that he does not ask them to give up anything more than he himself has given up. Knowledge (8:1), rights (8:9), and freedom (9:1) must be directed by love and concern for the spiritual well-being of others. </p>
<p> The sports analogy in 9:24-27 makes the point that the Christian life requires effort and the suppression of appetites and longings. It allows him to play on the Corinthians¡¯ craving for honor and to contrast the ephemeral reward bestowed on the winner of an athletic contest with the eternal prize that God will award the Christian victor. The prolonged, rigorous training required for success in athletic competition was a well-known image in the ancient world, and it sheds light on his own voluntary restraint in his refusing to exercise his apostolic rights so that he might successfully attain his goal of saving others. The metaphorical language may cloak how it applies to the Corinthian situation, but it is all part of his argument that ¡°believers should abstain from sacrificial meals.¡±84 The images of an athletic competitor enduring a rigorous training regimen, running determinedly, and bruising the body to bring it under rein disclose that Paul is not asking the Corinthians ¡°knowers¡± to try to be more discreet when they join in any festivities on an idol¡¯s grounds to protect the weak brother. He expects them to abandon any and all such participation. Paul cites the catchphrase ¡°Everything is permitted¡± in 10:23 (cf. 6:12), but he first emphasizes that everything is not permitted the athlete who hopes to win. Christian life ¡°involves the limitation as well as the enjoyment of freedom.¡±85 </p>
<p> The athletic simile also serves as a transition to the warning example of Israel in the next section (10:1-13). It warns that any who fail to exercise self-restraint when it comes to the delights of this world may be disqualified from the ultimate race directed by God. It is more than a general warning against complacency. It reminds Corinthians of the difficulties of living out their Christian commitment. Entry into the contest does not guarantee a prize, and they cannot repose in the illusion that they are safe from failure. </p>
<p> III. Refutation of Their Practice from the Negative Example of the History of Israel in the Wilderness (10:1-13) </p>
<p> In 10:1-13, Paul turns up the heat of his argument against idol food by appealing to a negative example from Israel¡¯s history. The move from personal example to extended biblical exposition again makes 10:1-13 appear to be a digression, but it fits perfectly his purpose. Israel¡¯s demise in the Wilderness is directly applicable to Christians in Corinth. The ¡°fathers¡¯¡± horrifying end in the desert highlights the peril the Corinthians risk by consorting with idols. Violating their covenant obligations and putting the Lord to the test is suicidal. Though the ¡°fathers¡± experienced divine provisions, the presence of Christ, and a prefigurement of baptism and the Lord¡¯s Supper, they failed to enter the promised land because of their idolatry. Their fall is a direct warning to the Corinthians since Paul underscores that the Scriptures directly apply to them (10:11). </p>
<p> Of the four warnings from the wilderness experience adduced in this section, Paul quotes only one passage (10:7): ¡°The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play¡± (Exod 32:6b). He features this one verse because it ties into the theme of eating and drinking that reverberates throughout chapters 8-10.86 It is suggestive that he does not cite a verse emphasizing their worship and sacrifice before the calf, for example, Exod 32:6a, 8, 31, 35, but chooses instead to cite their eating, drinking and playing that followed their sacrifices.87 Fee comments that the text specifically indicates that the people ate in the presence of the golden calf. He infers from this that idolatry for Paul is ¡°a matter of eating cultic meals in the idol¡¯s presence.¡±88 While Paul¡¯s concern is not limited only to Christians eating in an idol setting, this connection reveals that he certainly regarded eating in the presence of an idol as idolatry. </p>
<p> The point should be clear to the Corinthians. If they dally at pagan feasts, they can expect the same fate as Israel in the wilderness. They are not to be cravers of evil (10:6) or idolaters (10:7-8) and are not to put the Lord to the test (10:9) or grumble (10:10) if they expect their relationship to God to remain secure. The bold Corinthians may not fear the power of idols, but they should fear the wrath of God. They cannot grouse that being forbidden from participating in idol feasts places them in an untenable position. If they are faithful exclusively to God, they will never be in a situation too difficult for God to sustain them and to empower them to endure (10:13). </p>
<p> IV. Refutation of Their Practice from the Example of the Lord¡¯s Supper (10:14-22) </p>
<p> In this unit, Paul strikes directly by commanding them to flee idolatry (10:14) and connecting idol food to demons. He refutes their practice by appealing to the example of the Lord¡¯s Supper and the danger of ¡°serial fellowships.¡± As the Lord¡¯s Supper is a sacred meal that represents and creates a fellowship of believers in the worship of Christ who is considered to be present, so pagan meals represent and create a fellowship of worshipers of pagan deities who are also considered to be present. Idols, however, represent the realm of the demonic. Participating in the one meal precludes participating in the other. Believers should not fool themselves into thinking that they are strong enough to try to merge the two meals, to affiliate with Christ and demons. To attempt to do so only kindles the jealousy and judgment of God. </p>
<p> V. Practical Advice for Dealing with the Issue of Idol Food in Pagan Settings (10:23-11:1) </p>
<p> The question of temple dining and eating food sacrificed to idols is now left aside as Paul addresses the question of food of questionable origins – food that may have been sacrificed to idols before it comes into the hands of a believer. To answer the question how a Christian can act with integrity in a world brimming with idols, he moves from an absolute prohibition based on general arguments about the dangers of associating with anything idolatrous to conditional liberty based on the biblical tenet that the earth is the Lord¡¯s and everything in it (10:26; Ps 24:1). He gives the go-ahead on everything that is beyond an idol¡¯s orbit. It is not permanently poisoned. </p>
<p> Paul clarifies that food is food and permissible to eat unless it is specifically identified as idol food, which puts it in a special category that is always forbidden to Christians. They need not abstain from all food on the chance that it may have been sacrificed to idols. He basically says, ¡°Of course, you can buy food in the provision market¡± (10:25). ¡°Of course, you can dine with friends¡± (10:27). His prohibition of idol food does not mean that they must retreat to the seclusion of a gloomy ghetto. Nevertheless, he anticipates potential problems presented by food that a Christian might purchase from the market or food that a Christian might eat in the home of an unbeliever who might have offered it to idols. Smit contends that Paul¡¯s shift in 10:23-11:1 from his discussion about the idol offerings to an adjacent issue transgresses an important rhetorical rule. The transition may have made his prohibitions ¡°easier to digest,¡± but he does not go unpunished by the misunderstanding of his later interpreters who think that 10:23-11:1 refers to the idol offerings mentioned in 8:1.89 This shift has also led interpreters to suggest that Paul contradicts himself or to conjecture that the confusion is created by a later interpolation. </p>
<p> Many mistakenly assume that in this section Paul encourages the ¡°weak¡± to ease up on their criticism of the so-called ¡°strong.¡± Hall states, ¡°He now asks the weak to do something for the strong – namely, to begin to free themselves for their tyrannical scruples?¡±90 Nowhere does Paul mention the weak in this section or talk about scruples, let alone ¡°tyrannical scruples¡±! The maxim, ¡°All things are permissible,¡± which Paul amends with an emphasis on what is beneficial and builds up, hardly seems appropriate for launching a response to the so-called ¡°weak.¡± Hall wrongly claims that Paul ¡°belongs to the strong, and in his abrupt challenge to the weak he speaks not only for himself but also for those who see themselves as the strong in Corinth.¡± He has just declared that he identifies with the weak (9:22), not the so-called strong! Even if the argument that the person with a weak conscience is a hypothetical construct were incorrect, how could Paul encourage them to take a more relaxed view toward food when he expresses concern that they are extremely vulnerable to reverting to their former idolatrous practices (8:10)? This section is directed to the whole church, but if Paul were addressing a particular group, it would be the ¡°knowers.¡± They are most likely to seek their own advantage, to be invited to a banquet in an unbeliever¡¯s home, and to object to another¡¯s conscience constricting their liberty. </p>
<p> Paul permits buying food in the market-place that may or may not have been sacrificed in a pagan temple. But if its history was disclosed and it was announced to be idol food, then he forbids eating it. He permits dining with friends who may be worshipers of idols, but if the food is announced to be idol food, then he forbids eating it. Christians may not participate in any function that overtly smacks of idolatry. </p>
<p> He basically ¡°defines what is idol food in doubtful cases¡± – when it is not specified as idol food.91 All food outside of the idol¡¯s orbit is permitted, so he gives them leave to eat anything sold in the public market without investigating its history to certify that it is free from any idolatrous contamination. Christ has not called them to be meat inspectors. Outside of its idolatrous context, idol food becomes simply food and belongs to the one God (Rom 14:14). This ruling is far more liberal than one found in the Mishna that states: ¡°Flesh that is entering in unto an idol is permitted, but what comes forth is forbidden¡± (m. cAbod. Zar. 2:3). </p>
<p> When giving his advice about buying food in the provisions market or dining at a private gathering, Paul again mentions the conscience: buy or eat ¡°without inquiring [about its history] because of conscience¡± (10:25, 27). In the first case, it is not clear whose conscience is in view, the purchaser¡¯s or an observer¡¯s. Many conclude that he has in mind the ¡°bad feelings¡± of the weak who might spot a fellow Christian in a compromising position. In this scenario Paul¡¯s advises them to ignore the weak Christian¡¯s misgivings. This interpretation mistakenly reads into the text the presumed conflict between the so-called ¡°strong¡± and the ¡°weak.¡± Paul is not mediating this imagined conflict but offering general advice to all Christians about buying and eating food sold in the provision market. He recognizes that perceptions about idols are real. In the immediate context, Paul has raised their consciousness that idol food is hazardous material by linking it to demons. This new consciousness of the danger attached to idol food may encumber their decisions about purchasing food in the market that might have come from temple sacrifices, and he counsels them not to brood on that decision. He counsels them to buy and eat whatever you like and can afford. Idol food is not dangerous outside of its overtly idolatrous context. To ask questions about the food¡¯s history in the open market would unnecessarily burden their conscience.92 In this case, ignorance is bliss. It is not simply that ¡°what you don¡¯t know won¡¯t hurt you,¡±93 but why worry needlessly about something that is clearly a matter of indifference? In the same way that they need not worry that marriage to an unbeliever might somehow contaminate the believer (7:13-14), they need not worry that they will be contaminated by food that may have pagan antecedents. </p>
<p> The premise behind this instruction comes from Ps 24:1 (cf. 50:12; 89:11), which, in Judaism, shaped the prayer voiced before a meal (b. Šabb. 119a).94 It affirms that God is sovereign over all things (8:6) and that everything created by God is good (cf. 1 Tim 4:4). The whole creation belongs to God, not part to God and part to idols.95 Idol food therefore loses its character as idol food as soon as it leaves the idol¡¯s arena and the idolater¡¯s purposes. Paul does not complete the thought with a conclusion from the biblical citation, but it is implicit: ¡°Nothing is unclean in itself¡± (Rom 14:14; cf. Acts 10:15). If it can be eaten in honor of the Lord (Rom 14:7), it is permitted. What Paul finds sinful is eating idol food in any setting that might give others the slightest hint that Christians sanctioned idolatry, no matter how attenuated the religious aspects attached to the meal or the place might be. </p>
<p> In the second scene, Paul adds a caveat, ¡°If someone should say to you, ¡®This food is sacrificed to the gods,¡¯ do not eat, out of concern for the one who informed you and because of conscience.¡± He identifies the conscience as belonging to one who makes the declaration but only gives sketchy details about the informant, who it is, why he speaks, or how his conscience would be jeopardized. It is most likely from what follows that Paul envisions a pagan making the announcement. Ultimately, it makes no difference; the result is the same. The case is hypothetical offering instruction on how a Christian should respond in pagan surroundings, and there is no need to identify or to untangle the motives of the informer. Most likely the host proclaims his intentions about the food, but it could be ¡°anyone¡± who makes any such announcement. The declaration makes clear that the meal¡¯s atmosphere is distinguished by an act of idolatrous piety. </p>
<p> Paul instructs them not to eat because of the one who makes the disclosure and because of the conscience (sunei¢¯dhsij ). He clarifies in 10:29a that he refers to the conscience of the one who made the announcement, not the believer who accepted the invitation. What does the word conscience mean here? It is a slippery word whose meaning was in flux. Many assume that it must refer back to the weak conscience of the fellow believer in 8:7, 10, 12. But Paul says nothing about the conscience being weak or in danger of being wounded (8:12). It may simply mean that the person who makes the announcement is conscious that the food is religiously significant. </p>
<p> Paul formulates a key hermeneutical principle underlying his advice. The food¡¯s past history only matters when it matters to someone else who considers it sacred. Christians may know that idols do not exist, that there is no God but one, and that all food belongs ultimately to God. In this sticky situation, however, it is not their consciousness that counts, but that of the other. His approach to this issue is very close to that of rabbis. Tomson concludes (from t. Hull. 2:18; m. Hul. 2:8; m. Zeb. 1:1): </p>
<p> The Rabbinic view of idolatry is not so much concerned with material objects or actions as with the spiritual attitude with which these are approached by the gentiles. Correspondingly, the essence of idolatry is a ceremonial act of consecration, most typically expressed in slaughtering ¡®in the name of the deity.¡¯96 </p>
<p> The rabbis absolutely forbade direct or indirect contact with pagan rites, but they ruled that Jews could intermingle with Gentiles unless it became clear that they were engaged in some religious activity.97 They assumed that individuals could discern when the Gentile was engaged in idolatrous practices. Paul takes a far more liberal view in doubtful cases. Christians may assume that all is well and need not become sleuths trying to detect if the food has idolatrous connections. Instead, they may depend on the pagan¡¯s own pronouncement, ¡°This is sacred food.¡± When Christians find themselves in this situation, then they must abstain from eating lest they be drawn into idolatry. </p>
<p> Paul is not concerned here that they might endanger another Christian with a weak conscience. Their willing consumption of what has been announced as food sacrificed to idols would do three things: </p>
<p> (1) It would compromise ¡°their confession of the One God¡± with a tacit recognition of the sanctity of pagan gods. </p>
<p> (2) It would confirm, rather than challenge, the unbeliever¡¯s idolatrous convictions and would not lead the unbeliever away from the worship of false gods. If a Christian were to eat what a pagan acquaintance regards as an offering to a deity, it signals the Christian¡¯s tacit endorsement of idolatry. </p>
<p> (3) It would disable the basic Christian censure of pagan gods as false gods that embody something demonic and make that censure appear seem hypocritical.98 </p>
<p> In this counsel, Paul exhibits his concern about the Christian¡¯s witness to the unbeliever. The announcement presents an opportunity to expound one¡¯s faith in the one God and one Lord. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Meeks observes that ¡°to go the whole way, to ¡®turn from idols to serve the living God¡¯ . . ., was an act that entailed a profound resocialization, a change of identity and primary allegiance.¡±99 Paul expected Christians who turned from idols to create boundaries where there were none before. The pressure on Christians to conform to cultural norms, however, was enormous. When clever converts could construct abstract theological arguments that would make such costly dis-assimilation seem unnecessary, Paul has his work cut out for him to convince them otherwise. It explains why his argument starts by trying to find common ground with their perspective and is seemingly so roundabout. His expectations demanded of converts something that no other religion except Judaism required – avoiding anything that might hint that Christians sanctioned idolatry. Failure to repudiate all idolatrous associations, he maintains, would have dire spiritual consequences. </p>
<p> How does this apply to contemporary missions? If this exegesis is correct and if Paul is to be followed as a model, the belief in one God cannot be compromised. Becoming Christian means to turn away from idols. Anything that smacks of syncretism, no matter how it might be rationalized, is to be rejected. Paul is fully aware that living out this hard-line position in a world of idols is likely to provoke alienation, resentment, and abuse. That is why he offers the heartening words of 10:13. This instruction is easier said – particularly by one who lives in the buckle of the American Bible belt – than done. Many today are concerned not to cause offense, and toleration of other faiths has become the watchword. Paul is politically incorrect (quite literally, since he would oppose all participation, for example, in the imperial cult). He is more concerned about offending a jealous God who claims sovereignty over all aspects of life, including the individual Christian¡¯s life, than offending those who honor competing gods. He is also more concerned about the wrong message that unreflective tolerance might convey to those who are not followers of Christ. It would serve to confirm them in their unbelief and communicate unintentionally that Christ is simply another god in the pantheon of gods whose favor they might need to curry if it suited them and it offered advantages. Paul would sacrifice anything to break down boundaries that might hinder his efforts to win others to Christ. But one also had to maintain or build boundaries that could not be crossed. Since he opposes offering even a smidgen of religious esteem to other gods (including the Western god of materialism and its consort, standard of living), Christians can never be fully integrated into society. This stance sparked much of Paul¡¯s dispute with the Corinthians and was at the root of his grievances against the Corinthians. Barclay¡¯s incisive essay comparing the Thessalonian correspondence with the Corinthian correspondence draws this conclusion: </p>
<p> The church is not a cohesive community but a club, whose meetings provide important moments of spiritual insight and exaltation, but do not have global implications of moral and social change. The Corinthians could gladly participate in this church as one segment of their lives. But the segment, however important, is not the whole and the centre. Their perception of their church and of the significance of their faith could correlate well with a life-style which remained fully integrated in Corinthian society.100 </p>
<p> I would argue that Paul believes that the key implication of their new found faith in Christ as one Lord is their rejection of any semblance of allegiance to other lords and gods. </p>

For example, archaeologists have uncovered twenty inns and 118 bars in Pompeii that would have served warm snack food (J. Shelton, As the Romans Did: A Sourcebook in Roman Social History [2d ed.; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998], 307, n. 3). </p>
<p> 15Willis, Idol Meat, 8-64. This traditional view assumes that Paul made a distinction between innocuously consuming food associated with an idol (8:1-13) and participating in actual worship of an idol (10:14-22), but that conclusion is questionable. The translation ¡°idol meat¡± reads a particular social situation into the text. G. Theissen (The Social Setting of Pauline Christianity: Essays on Corinth [trans. J. H. Schütz; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1982], 121-43), for example, assumes that the issue revolves around the wealthier and poorer members and that latter were accustomed to eat meat only at some public temple feast or holiday (cf. also A. C. Thiselton , The First Epistle to the Corinthians (NIGTC; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2000) 617-20). J. J.

<p> 27Willis (Idol Meat, 244) oversimplifies the situation Paul addresses by breaking it down into only two: (1) Eating at the table of demons and becoming a partner of demons (10:14-21), which Paul absolutely forbids; and (2) Eating that is permissible but qualified by consideration of the other person who may be offended (10:31-32). </p>

<p> 38 Winter (¡°The Achaean Federal Imperial Cult ,¡± 170-72) argues that e)cousi/a should not be translated as ¡°liberty¡± but as ¡°right.¡± He argues that the problem arose after Paul left Corinth (cf. After Paul Left Corinth: The Influence of Secular Ethics and Social Change [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001] and understands ¡°the right¡± to refer to the civic right that some Corinthian Roman citizens possessed to participate in feasts held in the temple of Poseidon in Isthmia celebrating the Games. Provincials (incolae) were excluded, and any Corinthian Christians who possessed these rights would be naturally reluctant to give them up ¡°for reasons of social privilege or demonstrations of civic loyalty.¡± Winter makes a very strong case, but Paul uses the related words e)/cestin and e)cousiasqh/somai in 6:12 without any connection to citizen¡¯s rights. In 9:4-6, 12, 18 it refers to personal ¡°authority,¡± ¡°right,¡± or ¡°liberty¡± (different from his usage in Rom 13;1-3; 1 Cor 15:24; 2 Cor 10:8; 13:10). R. A. Horsley (1 Corinthians [ANTC; Nashville: Abingdon, 1998], 121) cites a parallel from Philo (Good Person 59) that captures Paul¡¯s use of e)cousi/a in this context: ¡°The good man acts rightly and ¡°will have the power (e)cousi/a ) to do anything, and to live as he wishes, and he who has this power (e)/cestin) must be free (e)leu/qeroj ).¡± </p>
<p> 39If the division between the strong and weak is a social one, as G. Theissen (The Social Setting of Pauline Christianity: Essays on Corinth [trans. J. H. Schütz; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1982], 137) argues, then it is only the wealthier ones who have the opportunity to join in the meat eating banquets. How can they encourage their poorer brethren to do so? Why would they want to be joined by poorer brethren? </p>
<p> 41Cf. G. W. Dawes, ¡°The Danger of Idolatry: First Corinthians 8:7-13,¡± CBQ 58 (1996): 86-88. </p>
<p> 42Paul¡¯s only mention of strength in 1 Cor 8:1-11:1 comes in an allusion to the OT, ¡°Are we stronger than he?¡± (10:22). The ¡°strong¡± in 1 Corinthians does not refer to a specific group so much as an attitude of the Corinthians (4:10, ¡°we are weak but you are strong¡±). </p>
<p> 43Conzelmann (1 Corinthians, 147) claims that ¡°conscience¡± and ¡°faith¡± are identical. He substitutes ¡°faith¡± for conscience¡± (cf. also R. Bultmann, Theology of the New Testament [trans. K. Grobel; New York: Scribner, 1955], 2:220). J. D. G. Dunn (The Theology of Paul the Apostle [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998], 703), however, correctly recognizes that ¡°faith¡± was the appropriate criterion for an internal issue but ¡°conscience¡± was more appropriate for a boundary-crossing issue. </p>
<p> 44J. C. Hurd, Jr., The Origin of 1 Corinthians (New York: Seabury, 1965), 117-25, 143-48. His concomitant thesis that the dispute was provoked when the Apostolic Council adopted a new policy on idol food that conflicted with Paul¡¯s earlier instructions unfortunately has made his arguments less compelling. Fee (First Epistle to the Corinthians, 358, 390) agrees that the letter to Paul was not a ¡°friendly inquiry¡± but took exception to his earlier prohibition of idol food. He (362) contends that the Corinthians¡¯ letter included these points: (1) All have knowledge about idols – ¡°Monotheism by its very nature rules out any genuine reality to idols (8:1, 4). . . .¡± Attendance at temples has no significance; they are just eating with friends, ¡°not worshiping what did not exist.¡± (2) ¡°They have knowledge about food – it is a matter of indifference to God (8:8).¡± (3) They had Christian baptism and partook of the Lord¡¯s Supper and were in no danger of falling (10:1-4). (4) They questioned ¡°Paul¡¯s proper apostolic authority to forbid them on this matter.¡± He also suggests that the Corinthians may have claimed that the weak ¡°will be ¡®built up¡¯ by taking ¡®authority¡¯ in this matter (8.9-10).¡± </p>
<p> 45Both succumb, however, to an over-reading of the text that finds the Corinthian position mirrored in too much of what Paul says. </p>
<p> 47Cf. Willis, Idol Meat, 267. Newton (Deity and Diet, 264-65) allows that ¡°Perhaps Paul had already tackled this issue during his eighteen months in Corinth, but because of misunderstanding, rejection, disobedience, confusion or the emergence of particular circumstances such the Isthmian Games, the conflict remained unresolved and compelled Paul to lift his pen.¡± </p>
<p> 48Cheung (Idol Food, 77) asserts that for Jews, ¡°Idol food simply epitomized idol worship.¡± Philo, living in Alexandria, took pains to explain and justify the rules for kashrut often resorting to elaborate allegorical artifices. He did not explain why idolatry was forbidden and must have regarded it as self-evident from the Jew¡¯s exclusive allegiance to God. He ferociously condemns any connection to idolatrous behavior by Jews: </p>
<p> If anyone cloaking himself under the name and guise of a prophet and claiming to be possessed by inspiration lead us on to worship of the gods . . . And if a brother or son or daughter . . . or anyone else who seems to be kindly disposed, urges us to alike course, bidding us fraternize with the multitude, resort to temples, and join in their libations and sacrifices, we must punish him as a public and general enemy, taking little thought for the ties which bind us to him . . . and deem it a religious duty to seek his death (Spec. Laws. 1.315-16). </p>
<p> Among the rabbis, idol food was absolutely banned when it was known to be such, and they only debated ambiguous cases. </p>
<p> 49Idols are reviled in the OT as mere sticks and stones, no better than scarecrows (Jer 10:5). The Psalmist mocks them not only for being the creation of human hands but for having human features, mouths, eyes, ears, noses, hands, feet, that do not work (Pss 115:4-8; 135:15-18). Not only are they not divine, they are manifestly less than human. </p>
<p> 50The word ei)dwlo/quton appears in Acts 15:29; 21:25; Rev 2:14, 20; Did. 6:3; 4 Macc 5:2; Sib. Or. 2.96; Jos. Asen. 12:5; and Ps. Phoc. 31. Cf. the neologism a)rsenokoi=tai in 1 Cor 6:11, which appears to be coined from the phrase o(/j a)/n koimhqv= meta\ a/)rsenoj koi¢¯thn gunaiko/j in Lev 20:13 (cf. Lev 18:22). </p>

<p> 59Juvenal (Sat. 5.12-22) explains that dinner invitations from a patron were regarded as repayments for services rendered (cf. the parables of the banquets in Matt 22:1-14 and Luke 14:12-24). </p>

<p> 62T. Engberg-Pedersen (¡°The Gospel and Social Practice According to 1 Corinthians.,¡± NTS 33 [1987]: 579) contends that in situations where the gospel requires certain behavior and is in reach of his addressees, Paul uses imperatives – ¡°but always with the sense of reminding his addressees of things they already know and subscribe to.¡± In situations where a certain behavior is required by the gospel is ¡°not within immediate reach of Paul¡¯s addressees,¡± Paul does not use imperatives but exhorts by means of examples and ¡°showing what application of the gospel in such situations would consist in.¡± Engberg-Pedersen considers 8:1-11, which he characterizes as ¡°not offending the brother,¡± as fitting the first situation. I would argue to the contrary that the situation concerns idol food and fits the second case instead. Paul does not think it is quite in reach because of the social complexity involved in idol food. </p>

<p> 66Fee (First Corinthians, 363) claims that Paul¡¯s ¡°first concern is with the incorrect ethical basis of their argument. The problem is primarily attitudinal.¡± But the problem is idolatry – behavior, not merely a bad attitude expressed in an imperious contempt for the weak. </p>
<p> 67P. D. Gardner (The Gifts of God and the Authentication of a Christian: An Exegetical Study of 1 Corinthians 8:1-11:1 [Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1994], 43) notes that Paul was writing at a time ¡°when the connotation of the words relating to ¡®conscience¡¯ was changing¡± and that the meaning of the word therefore must come from ¡°the local context¡± of chapters 8-10. Paul describes it as something that can be ¡°polluted¡± (8:7), ¡°built up¡± ( 8:10), or ¡°wounded¡± ( 8:12) and connects it to raising questions ( 10:25, 27) and ¡°judging others¡± ( 10:29). </p>

<p> Fee (First Corinthians, 386, n. 56) cannot understand why the weak would eat idol food unless they were pressured in some way. This impression stems from the mistaken assumption that the weak primarily faced a moral struggle about eating idol food or dining in temples and that they would act against their conscience because they cannot counter the knower¡¯s arguments. The social pressure to mix in the society and not to be perceived as misanthropic would be sufficient motivation for them to join in the banquets. The example of the knowers would be enough to persuade their consciences that this activity was permissible. </p>

<p> What Happens If You Eat Fly Eggs? </p>
<p> By Staff WriterLast Updated March 26, 2020 </p>
<p> Follow Us: </p>
<p> Apart from the risk posed by eating the decaying food they were laid in, eating the eggs of most fly species is generally no more harmful to healthy adults than eating other organic matter. Some species of fly, however, are capable of either hatching out or surviving passage through the human gastrointestinal tract, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and can cause unpleasant symptoms if an infestation occurs. </p>
<p> Fly infestation of the body is known as myiasis, and several species of fly are able to infect humans, the CDC reports. In one case, a 1-year-old girl in Washington state was brought to her doctor when her mother saw "moving worms" in the girl's feces. These turned out to be maggots of the species Muscina stabulans, or false stable flies, that infested the girl's GI tract after she was fed overripe bananas containing the unhatched fly eggs. As reported by her doctor, the girl was asymptomatic and the issue cleared up without treatment. </p>
<p> Sometimes, however, internal myiasis brought on by ingesting fly eggs causes cramps, vomiting and diarrhea. The CDC advises covering exposed fruit and washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly before consumption. Deliberately eating fly eggs is also not advisable for most people. </p>

<p> Why Do You Get Headaches After Eating? </p>
<p> If you’ve ever noticed that your head hurts after you eat, you’re not alone. This is called a postprandial headache — postprandial meaning “after eating.” </p>
<p> If this type of headache occurs on a regular basis, you shouldn’t ignore it. While some headaches may be caused or triggered by certain types of foods, some are symptoms of underlying conditions that require medical attention. Keep reading to learn what might be causing your post-meal headache. </p>
<p> Headaches after eating occur with a variety of pain levels and have several possible causes. </p>
<p> Some people notice that their post-food headaches are especially bad after eating certain foods, or consuming sweets or carbs. Still, others notice a pattern of headaches after every meal. </p>
<p> There are several possible reason for these headaches. Here’s some of the most common: </p>
<p> Postprandial hypoglycemia </p>
<p> Also called reactive hypoglycemia, this condition is characterized by a headache within 4 hours after eating. It’s triggered by a drop in blood sugar levels. Some causes include: </p>
<p> diabetes </p>
<p> digestive tumors </p>
<p> abnormal hormone levels </p>
<p> Food allergy </p>
<p> You may believe that an allergy always carries symptoms similar to allergic rhinitis — such as sneezing or a runny nose — but that’s not always the case. In fact, food allergies can cause a host of reactions, including headaches. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing headaches after eating a specific food or ingredient, it’s possible that you may be allergic to a food and be unaware of the allergy. </p>
<p> Food intolerance </p>
<p> Different than a food allergy, the symptoms of a food intolerance are almost always digestive in nature. However, in some instances, they can trigger a headache after eating. </p>
<p> TMJ disorders </p>
<p> The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that connects your lower jaw (the mandible) to the portion of your skull (the temporal bone) in front of your ear. </p>
<p> TMJ disorders are generally characterized by a popping or clicking sound, or a tight feeling on either side of your jaw when opening and closing your mouth. Because the affected joint is so closely tied to your head area, chewing can also trigger pain and cause a headache. </p>
<p> Cold stimulus </p>
<p> This type of headache is commonly known as a brain freeze or “ice cream headache.” It occurs after eating or drinking something frozen or very cold. </p>
<p> Experts believe it happens due to changes in the blood vessels around certain nerves, in response to cold temperature. This type of headache can be intense, lasting seconds to minutes, but doesn’t require any treatment. </p>
<p> Stay hydrated </p>
<p> Be sure to drink enough water throughout the day by paying attention to your thirst. </p>
<p> Staying hydrated is an important part of managing headaches. Not drinking enough fluids, especially in hot weather, can cause you to become dehydrated, adding to headache pain. </p>
<p> Water is typically an ideal choice, since it avoids the added sugar that’s found in juices, flavored coffee, sweetened tea, and other sweetened drinks. </p>
<p> Steer clear of foods and drinks that contain artificial sweeteners since they can aggravate headaches in certain people. </p>
<p> Consider an elimination diet </p>
<p> It’s important to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. But when a balanced diet doesn’t improve your headaches after eating, consider talking to your doctor about an elimination diet. </p>
<p> An elimination diet is done much like a science experience in that you continue to try different food choices to see how you’re impacted by each. This can help you discover food intolerances, sensitivities, and potential allergies. </p>
<p> For example, you may try going a certain period of time without dairy products to see if you still experience symptoms after eating. If your headaches go away during this time, you may have pinpointed a food sensitivity. </p>
<p> If they don’t go away, you can add the dairy back to your diet and eliminate another food that may be the culprit. This process can be continued until a trigger food is revealed. You should always do an elimination diet under the guidance of a doctor or nutritionist. </p>
<p> If you experience headaches after eating, see your doctor. It’s important to detect and treat conditions like abnormal blood sugar, TMJ disorder, or food allergies and intolerances, if they’re what’s causing your headaches. </p>
<p> Fortunately, many headaches after eating can be treated easily. </p>

<p> Which countries eat the most meat? </p>
<p> You may have heard an increasing number of people vow to reduce their meat eating lately - or cut it out altogether. </p>
<p> This often forms part of a bid to become healthier, reduce their environmental impact, or consider animal welfare. </p>
<p> This trend is partly thanks to initiatives such as Meat-free Mondays and Veganuary. At the same time, a number of documentaries and high-profile advocates of veganism have highlighted the potential benefits of eating less meat. </p>
<p> But have these sentiments had any effect on the ground? </p>
<p> Rising incomes </p>
<p> What we do know is that global meat consumption has increased rapidly over the past 50 years. </p>
<p> Meat production today is nearly five times higher than in the early 1960s - from 70 million tonnes to more than 330 million tonnes in 2017. </p>
<p> A big reason for this is that there are many more people to feed. </p>
<p> Over that period the world population more than doubled. In the early 1960s there were around three billion of us, and today there are more than 7.6 billion. </p>
<p> While population is part of the story, it doesn't entirely account for why meat production increased five-fold. </p>
<p> Another key factor is rising incomes. </p>
<p> Around the world, people have become richer, with the global average income more than tripling in half a century. </p>
<p> When we compare consumption across different countries we see that, typically, the richer we are the more meat we eat. </p>
<p> There are not just more people in the world - there are more people who can afford to eat meat. </p>
<p> Who eats the most meat? </p>
<p> We see a clear link with wealth when looking at patterns of meat consumption across the world. </p>
<p> In 2013, the most recent year available, the US and Australia topped the tables for annual meat consumption. Alongside New Zealand and Argentina, both countries topped more than 100kg per person, the equivalent to about 50 chickens or half a cow each. </p>
<p> In fact, high levels of meat consumption can be seen across the West, with most countries in Western Europe consuming between 80 and 90 kilograms of meat per person. </p>
<p> At the other end of the spectrum, many of the world's poorest countries eat very little meat. </p>
<p> The average Ethiopian consumes just 7kg, Rwandans 8kg and Nigerians 9kg. This is 10 times less than the average European. </p>
<p> For those in low-income countries, meat is still very much a luxury. </p>
<p> These figures represent the amount of meat per head available for consumption, but do not account for any food wasted at home or on the shop floor. In reality, people eat slightly less meat than this, but it's still a close estimate. </p>
<p> Middle-income countries driving the demand for meat </p>
<p> It is clear that the richest countries eat a lot of meat, and those on low incomes eat little. </p>
<p> This has been the case for 50 years or more. So why are we collectively eating so much more meat? </p>
<p> This trend has been largely driven from a growing band of middle-income countries. </p>
<p> Rapidly growing nations like China and Brazil have seen significant economic growth in recent decades, and a large rise in meat consumption. </p>
<p> In Kenya, meat consumption has changed little since 1960. </p>
<p> By contrast, the average person in 1960s China consumed less than 5kg a year. By the late 1980s this had risen to 20kg, and in the last few decades this has more than tripled to over 60kg. </p>
<p> The same thing happened in Brazil, where meat consumption has almost doubled since 1990 - overtaking almost all Western countries in the process. </p>
<p> India is one notable exception. </p>
<p> While average incomes have tripled since 1990, meat consumption hasn't followed suit. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, the amount of meat consumed in India has remained small. At less than 4kg per person, it is the lowest in the world. This is likely to be partly down to cultural factors for some in India, including not eating certain types of meat for religious reasons. </p>
<p> Is meat consumption falling in the West? </p>
<p> Many in Europe and North America say they are trying to cut down on meat, but is it working? </p>
<p> Not really, according to statistics. </p>
<p> Recent data from the United States Department for Agriculture (USDA) suggests meat consumption per head has actually increased over the last few years. </p>
<p> While we may think that meat is becoming less popular, US consumption in 2018 was close to its highest in decades. </p>
<p> It's a similar picture with meat consumption in the EU. </p>
<p> While Western consumption of meat is steady, or slightly increasing, the types of meat eaten are changing. </p>
<p> This means less red meat - beef and pork - and more poultry. </p>
<p> In the US, poultry now accounts for half of meat consumption, up from a quarter in the 1970s. </p>
<p> These types of substitution could be good news for health and the environment. </p>
<p> The impact of meat </p>
<p> In some circumstances, eating meat can be beneficial. </p>
<p> Moderate quantities of meat and dairy can improve people's health, particularly in lower-income countries where diets may lack variety. </p>
<p> But in many countries, meat consumption goes far beyond basic nutritional benefits. </p>
<p> Compared to chicken, beef has anywhere in the range of three to 10 times as much impact on land use, water and greenhouse gas emissions. Pork is somewhere in between the two. </p>
<p> A future where meat consumption is sustainable and balanced across countries would require major changes. </p>
<p> This would mean not only a shift in the types of meat we eat, but also how much. </p>
<p> Essentially, meat would have to become more of a luxury again. </p>

<p> New York State Health Advice on Eating Fish You Catch </p>
<p> Fishing is fun, and fish are an important part of a healthy diet. Fish contain high quality protein, essential nutrients, healthy fish oils, and are low in saturated fat. However, some fish contain chemicals at levels that may be harmful to health. To help people make healthier choices about which fish to eat, the New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) issues advice about eating sportfish (the fish you catch). </p>
<p> The health advice about which fish to eat depends on: </p>
<p> Where You Fish </p>
<p> The advice on eating fish from New York State depends upon where you fish. The state is divided into ten regions. Each has great fishing and many waters where everyone in the family can eat up to four fish meals a month. However, some waters and their tributaries have been affected by industrial chemicals, pesticides, and/or mercury. Our advice is to limit fish meals or avoid eating fish from these waters with specific advice. </p>
<p> Who You Are </p>
<p> Women of childbearing age (under 50) and children under 15 are advised to limit the kinds of fish they eat and how often they eat them from waters with known chemicals. Women who eat highly contaminated fish and become pregnant may have an increased risk of having children who are slower to develop and learn. Chemicals may have a greater effect on the development of young children or unborn babies. Also, some chemicals may be passed on in mother’s milk. </p>
<p> Women beyond their childbearing years and men may face fewer health risks from some chemicals. For that reason, the advice for women over age 50 and men over age 15 allows them to eat more kinds of sportfish and more often (see advice tables for each region). </p>
<p> What You Catch </p>
<p> Some fish have higher levels of chemicals than others. In general, smaller fish are less contaminated than larger, older fish of the same species (for more information see Tips for Healthier Eating). There is specific advice about limiting or not eating certain kinds of fish due to contamination across the state in approximately 150 waters (see advice tables). However, NY is a water rich state and you can also choose to eat fish from waters not listed in the advice tables and follow the general advice to eat up to four meals per month in thousands of other waters. </p>

<p> Here's What Happens When You Eat Fish Every Day </p>
<p> Fish is an incredibly versatile and broad food that can be prepared enough ways, that eating it every day wouldn't even seem like a challenge. Low in fat but high in protein, fish can easily serve as a center-of-the plate main focus of the meal (think a pan-fried filet), or can be used as an appetizer (think sardines on toast). </p>
<p> While intensely-flavored species such as mackerel, herring, anchovies, and sardines might put off some more picky eaters, you would be hard-pressed to find many people who aren't fans of more mild fish such as red snapper, cod, or sea bass. Even salmon, an oily and "fishy" option is more often than not a crowd-pleaser. </p>
<p> Eating fish every day will have a positive effect on a number of different systems in the body, although depending on the type of fish being consumed, it may come with a drawback as well. </p>
<p> You'll decrease your risk of heart attacks </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> A study of 40,000 men in the United States found that those who consumed at least one serving of fish every week decreased their risk of heart disease by 15 percent (via The National Library of Medicine). Other studies have also found that the risk of heart attacks and other heart disease is lessened among those who eat fish regularly (via Healthline). </p>
<p> While it may seem counterintuitive, the fattier the fish, the better it is for your heart. Fatty fish such as salmon, sea bass, and sardines are high in omega-3 fatty acid, which is optimal for heart health. These fatty fish actually contain two kinds of omega-3 fatty acids: DHA and EPA, both have which have been shown to have a number of wide-ranging health benefits (via Medical News Today). In addition to being heart-healthy, they have been shown to minimize inflammation in the body, and combat anxiety (via Harvard Health Letter). </p>
<p> You might be ingesting a dangerous amount of mercury </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Mercury is a metal found in both freshwater and saltwater water systems. It's caused by both natural sources as well as pollutants (via The United States Geological Survey). High levels of mercury have been associated with lung and kidney problems, and issues with the nervous, digestive, and immune systems. High levels of mercury intake can be deadly. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, bigger fish such as tuna, swordfish, and king mackerel generally have the highest levels of mercury because they consume smaller fish, which have small amounts in their systems (via National Resources Defense Council). We, in turn, eat those larger fish and the mercury begins to build up in our own bodies. Mercury is particularly impactful on developing babies, which is why pregnant women are warned against eating fish with a high mercury content (via March of Dimes). </p>
<p> The effects of aging on the brain could be counteracted </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> While cognitive decline is a natural occurrence during the aging process, the consumption of fish has been shown to slow the rate of mental decline (via The National Library of Medicine). </p>
<p> Fish consumption is also shown to help with improving the functional tissue of the brain, in areas that deal with memory. Another benefit of the previously mentioned omega-3 fatty acids is that they help with brain health. Specifically, they aid in building the membranes around the brain cells, which improves their structure and function (via Medical News Today). A study from 2017 carried out by a number of California university research centers found that omega-3 fatty acids are able to increase the blood flow to the brain as well (via The National Library of Medicine). The same study found that there was a connection between omega-3 intake and improved cognitive function. </p>
<p> You'll get your vitamin D intake even if it's cloudy </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> The body creates vitamin D from exposure to direct sunlight. In sunny part of the world, humans ought to be able to soak up all of the vitamin D the body needs solely from the sun's rays, especially during the warmer months of the year (via The National Health Service). However, in regions without ample amounts of sun or during cloudy periods of the year, the body still needs vitamin D because the vitamin helps in regulating the amount of calcium in the body, and is essential in keeping the bones, teeth, and muscles in good shape (via The National Health Service). </p>
<p> Fish can provide a source of vitamin D year round, and you don't need to eat much of it either. A single 4-ounce serving of salmon can get you 100 percent of the recommended daily value. Nearly half of the United States population is vitamin D deficient, but a couple of outings to the fishmonger would put that problem to rest right away. </p>

<p> Here's What Queen Elizabeth Typically Eats In A Day </p>
<p> Here's What Queen Elizabeth Typically Eats In A Day </p>
<p> Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images </p>
<p> By Korey Lane/Sept. 2, 2020 11:45 am EDT/Updated: April 21, 2021 12:26 pm EDT </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth II is one of a kind. </p>
<p> There are few public figures out there who are quite as regal and mysterious as the queen, who has reigned over England for over 66 years, and has obviously lived quite a fabulous life. And while her many riches have likely given her access to great physicians who have helped her live as long as she has, people also wonder what else she does to stay so healthy. </p>
<p> Surprisingly enough, the queen's diet just might be the key factor in her health and longevity. In fact, a lot of what the queen eats is considered to be quite healthy, which has undoubtedly kept her in such great condition despite her advancing age. Queen Elizabeth obviously doesn't have to worry about money, and has access to personal chefs and plenty of staff to see to it that she eats great food. However, as it turns out, eating like royalty isn't actually all that hard — at least, not when it comes to what Queen Elizabeth typically eats in a day. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth isn't a "foodie" </p>
<p> Anwar Hussein/Getty Images </p>
<p> If Queen Elizabeth were a millennial, she definitely wouldn't be snapping pictures of her food to post on social media. </p>
<p> Many people have likely heard the dieting advice, "Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper." The phrase is popular among those looking to control their portions and drop some pounds; however, perhaps the best portion control advice comes from Queen Elizabeth's daily diet. While you might assume the queen treats herself to extravagant truffles, cakes, and trays of expensive caviar all day, every day — insider sources say the opposite is true. </p>
<p> In fact, Darren McGrady, who served as a chef in the royal kitchen, explained that the queen is "not a foodie," according to The Telegraph. "She eats to live," McGrady said, noting that Prince Philip "[loved] to eat and would stand and talk food all day." Honestly, when you're the queen and you have access to any kind of food or dessert you could possibly imagine, it must take a lot of discipline to not totally pig out every day. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth starts her morning with the same thing every day </p>
<p> Anwar Hussein/Getty Images </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth is obviously a routine queen — especially when it comes to her favorite morning beverage. </p>
<p> In America, it's pretty common for most adults to start their day with a cup (or three) of coffee. If you're American, coffee is definitely the most popular way to get your caffeine fix and jumpstart your day; however, in England, tea is a more popular caffeine choice. And for Queen Elizabeth, starting each day with a cup of tea is part of her normal, everyday routine. </p>
<p> Specifically, according to British Telecommunications, the queen always drinks Earl Grey tea in the morning, right before breakfast. And the queen doesn't take her tea with milk or sugar, meaning there aren't any hidden calories in her morning cup of caffeine. That said, British Telecommunications also reports that the queen takes her tea with some biscuits (or cookies, if you're American), so her morning routine isn't completely devoid of deliciousness. Still, Earl Grey tea is full of health benefits like antioxidants, which might be part of the reason why Queen Elizabeth is still so fit and healthy. </p>
<p> There's one pastry Queen Elizabeth doesn't like </p>
<p> Pool/Getty Images </p>
<p> No scones for Queen Elizabeth, please! </p>
<p> While the language may be the same in England as it is in America, there are still plenty of differences — such as breakfast pastries. While Americans know what scones are, they aren't as popular in the United States as they are across the pond. However, while scones are often served with tea and are a fairly popular sweet treat in England, that doesn't mean Queen Elizabeth is a fan of the pastries. </p>
<p> In fact, though the queen may be offered scones at breakfast, she doesn't eat them. Instead, Queen Elizabeth's staff has to take on the hard job of downing the queen's scones. "The poor royal pastry chef, he spends all day making these scones and they get fed to the corgis under the table!" Princess Diana's former butler Paul Burrell told TLC (via News24). Burrell continued, "The queen never eats the scones; the corgis eat them." For whatever reason, Queen Elizabeth just isn't fond of scones, and she won't waste her time with them. Hey, the woman knows what she likes! </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth's breakfast choice is surprisingly simple </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth's breakfast is probably familiar to many people, even if they aren't royalty. </p>
<p> Clearly, decadence isn't really a major factor taken into consideration by Queen Elizabeth when she's deciding what she wants to eat. This is especially true when it comes to breakfast. Sure, the queen could have mimosas and French toast every morning if she wanted to; however, Queen Elizabeth is particularly fond of this one breakfast item — and it's not all that exciting. </p>
<p> According to Reader's Digest, Queen Elizabeth is reportedly a huge cereal fan – and her favorite brand just might be yours, too: Special K. The popular low-calorie cereal known for the diet of the same name in America is what the queen chooses to start her day with most of the time. Honestly, it's not like the cereal is anything special or fancy, and it's also quite affordable. So, if you've ever wanted to eat like royalty, all you really need to do is pick up a box of Special K the next time you're at the supermarket! Queens – they're just like us! </p>
<p> Sometimes Queen Elizabeth likes to mix things up for breakfast </p>
<p> On most days, Queen Elizabeth really only has tea, biscuits, and cereal for breakfast. However, every so often, the queen likes to mix things up for breakfast by eating something with a bit more flavor. </p>
<p> According to Reader's Digest, the queen might sometimes simply eat toast with a marmalade, or she might go all out and have scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and truffle grated on top. Reader's Digest also notes that Queen Elizabeth prefers brown eggs because she thinks they have a better taste to them. Now, it's worth noting that this isn't something Queen Elizabeth eats every day, but if she has a guest (or is just feeling hungrier than usual), a fancy scrambled egg isn't out of the question. Of course, this breakfast sounds a lot more regal than her Special K morning meal. Clearly, balance is key for this queen. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth's afternoon meal is pretty light </p>
<p> Wpa Pool/Getty Images </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth's energy often seems boundless. After all, being the literal Queen of England seems pretty exhausting — and even though Queen Elizabeth could totally retire and take time off, she is still the reigning monarch in Britain. </p>
<p> That said, the queen has to properly fuel her body to give her the energy to get through her day. And when it comes to her afternoon, energy-boosting meal, Queen Elizabeth keeps it pretty simple — as well as fairly light. </p>
<p> Princess Diana's former butler, Paul Burrell told TLC (via News24) that the queen had one favorite meal to eat in the afternoon, and it sounds quite sophisticated. "I don't think it's betraying any state secrets to tell you that the queen loves cheese and tomato sandwiches on granary bread and cucumber sandwiches on white bread," Burrell said. Additionally, Darren McGrady, who was the former chef in the royal kitchen, told The Telegraph that another one of Queen Elizabeth's most common lunches was grilled Dover sole served with spinach and zucchini. Once again, the queen has proven that her diet is pretty plain, but it's clearly working for her. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth's go-to dinner choice is super healthy </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> When you're Queen Elizabeth (or any member of the royal family), you probably get used to having fancy dinner parties with dignitaries and foreign ambassadors. </p>
<p> A lavish meal with plenty to go around, endless alcohol, and all the desserts one could possibly imagine is likely what people expect of royal dinners, but that's not always the reality — at least, not for Queen Elizabeth. Sure, the queen might indulge while she's entertaining guests, but for the most part, her dinner is pretty healthy. </p>
<p> The queen's former chef, Darren McGrady — who worked for her for over 10 years — told CNN that when Queen Elizabeth is home alone, she'll have a meal that would make every nutritionist proud: a grilled or poached portion of fish and then a salad and vegetables on the side. "That's it. That's all she has," McGrady said. He continued, saying, "She's very disciplined like that. She could have anything she wanted, but it is that discipline that keeps her so well and so healthy." </p>
<p> Dinner can sometimes be indulgent for Queen Elizabeth </p>
<p> Anwar Hussein/Getty Images </p>
<p> Whether or not Queen Elizabeth has people over for dinner, there are the random occasions when the royal monarch chooses to truly indulge at the end of the day. After all, being a queen must be exhausting, and who wouldn't want to wind down from a long day of royal duties with an extravagant meal? </p>
<p> According to The Independent, there are days when Queen Elizabeth will go for a richer meat, such as venison or beef, or even salmon or pheasant. Whatever type of protein she chooses, it's then turned into what's called a Gaelic steak, which is served with a cream, whisky, and mushroom sauce. Um — is anyone else suddenly starving? </p>
<p> As noted by The Independent, Queen Elizabeth is also one for tradition, so she will occasionally consume the traditional Sunday roast, which she prefers to be cooked well done. This is certainly the kind of meal that nourishes your soul, as well as your body. Now, that sounds like a dinner fit for a queen. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth's favorite drink is quite dignified </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth's drinking habits are just as classy as she is! </p>
<p> Obviously, alcohol isn't very healthy, especially if you drink a lot of it. But just like most things, consuming alcohol in moderation won't kill you. For Queen Elizabeth, alcoholic beverages are definitely part of her daily routine, but not in the excess amount you might imagine when you hear "alcoholic beverages" and "daily routine" in the same sentence. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth's former chef Darren McGrady told CNN all about the monarch's drinking habits, making it clear that the queen doesn't drink to get wasted. According to McGrady, the queen will have a drink to loosen up, but "just in the evening. McGrady continued, saying, "She certainly doesn't drink four glasses a day. She'd be pickled if she drank that much." Added the former chef, "All I said was she likes a gin and Dubonnet. That's her favorite drink." </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth hates this ingredient and avoids it at all costs </p>

<p> Queen Elizabeth can be somewhat of a picky eater, especially when it comes to the ingredients used to give her foods flavor. </p>
<p> If you've ever been interested or fascinated by the royal family, then you might have heard the rumors that Queen Elizabeth has one specific ingredient that she isn't too fond of — and for many people, it's quite surprising. For the longest time, the queen has hated garlic. And while it's unclear exactly why, garlic is not permitted in the queen's kitchen — or in her food. Darren McGrady, the former royal chef, told Recipes Plus that chefs in the royal kitchen "can never serve anything with garlic or too many onions." McGrady continued, revealing, "The queen would never have garlic on the menu." </p>
<p> When asked what the royals couldn't eat during an appearance on MasterChef Australia (via AOL), Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, replied, "I hate to say this, but garlic." She continued, saying, "Garlic is a no-no." For whatever reason, garlic is off-limits when dining with the queen — leaving us to wonder what the staff uses to season the queen's food. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth loves chocolate </p>

<p> Queen Elizabeth might have more in common with you than you realize — especially if you're a big fan of chocolate. </p>
<p> Though members of the royal family lead pretty charmed lives, they'e still human beings, just like us. Sure, they wear crowns and jewels and have net worths equivalent to the GDP of a small nation, but they're still people. And like normal people, Queen Elizabeth enjoys a bit of chocolate. In fact, the queen has actually been known to adore the sweet treat. </p>
<p> Darren McGrady, former royal chef to Queen Elizabeth, told CNN that Queen Elizabeth is "a chocoholic." However, McGrady continued, adding that the queen has a specific preference for her chocolatey treats. "It has to be the dark chocolate ... the darker the better," he said. Added McGrady, "She wasn't keen on milk chocolate or white chocolate." With antioxidants, fiber, and a ton of other nutrients, Queen Elizabeth honestly couldn't have picked a better way to satisfy her sweet tooth than with dark chocolate. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth steers clear of this food type </p>

<p> Queen Elizabeth is the queen of self-restraint, according to her former chef. </p>
<p> One of the hardest parts of being an adult is not stuffing your face with cookies and chips at all hours of the day just because you can. Self-control is a difficult lesson to learn, but it seemingly runs in the royal blood, as Queen Elizabeth has mastered the art of telling herself no. The queen might indulge every now and then in rich meals and delicious desserts, but for the most part, she is strict with her diet. And, there's one thing she absolutely avoids that probably makes her healthy diet even healthier. </p>
<p> Darren McGrady, a former chef in the royal kitchens, told The Telegraph that the queen obviously will eat more when she entertains guests. However, McGrady clarified, "When she dines on her own, she's very disciplined." And according to McGrady, part of the queen's discipline includes saying no to starch. Of course, this means no baked potatoes, dinner rolls, or even corn will be found on the queen's dinner table. While that may sound pretty boring, it's impressive that the queen can display such restraint. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth is a total farm-to-table kind of gal. </p>
<p> In the world we live in, there are plenty of health trends that come and go. The keto diet, intermittent fasting, going vegan, and macro tracking have all been pretty popular in recent years, but another health trend that's garnered plenty of attention is eating local, organic food. However, trendy as it may be, Queen Elizabeth has long been eating local, organic, farm-to-table foods — even before it was cool. </p>
<p> "The queen loves to eat food from the estate," former chef Darren McGrady told CNN. McGrady added that the queen preferred vegetables that were home-grown, and meat from any of her estates. McGrady also told RecipesPlus (via Delish), that the queen isn't a stickler for seasonal foods. "You can send strawberries every day to the Queen during summer at Balmoral [Castle] and she'll never say a word." McGrady explained. Clearly, having a ton of estates and plenty of money makes eating locally a lot easier, but Queen Elizabeth has been ahead of the food trends for a while. </p>
<p> Queen Elizabeth ends her days in the most royal way possible </p>

<p> Pop the champagne — Queen Elizabeth wants a glass! </p>
<p> After a long, hard day of being the longest-reigning monarch in England, you might expect Queen Elizabeth to simply head off to bed and get some well-earned sleep. However, this queen isn't too old or too tired to treat herself in the most royal way possible before drifting off to dreamland. As it turns out, Queen Elizabeth likes to end her day with a glass of bubbly — and honestly, who can blame her? </p>
<p> According to The Independent, Queen Elizabeth likes a nice glass of champagne every day (or, in this case, every night), and she's fond of several brands. Lanson, Krug, and Bollinger are reportedly three of her favorite brands of champagne — so if you're ever in the mood to drink like the queen, now you know how. Perhaps the queen prefers to eat healthy throughout the day so that she can truly enjoy her nightly glass of champagne. Whatever the case may be, if anyone deserves a glass of bubbly every night, it's Queen Elizabeth. </p>

<p> Here's Why You Should Eat Fruit Even Though It Contains Sugar </p>
<p> Fruit is an essential part of a healthy diet. Here's why, plus learn what a registered dietitian thinks. </p>
<p> Lauren Wicks, Nutrition review by: Lisa Valente, M.S., R.D. </p>
<p> Sugar can often feel like a bad ex-boyfriend we can't seem to stay away from no matter how hard we try. We know we need to eat less of it-maybe we even go on a sugar cleanse or detox in an attempt to stop the craving-but even just a small indulgence can quickly send us back into a full-on sugar obsession. However, one kind of sugar that doesn't deserve to get kicked to the curb: fruit! </p>
<p> Fruit often gets a bad rap for its sugar content, but we are begging you to please stop comparing donuts and bananas! The sugar naturally found in fruit is so much different than the dozens of various sweeteners on grocery store shelves. Naturally-occuring sugars are also found in dairy and vegetables. </p>
<p> Plus, fruit is so much more than just nature's candy. Most fruits are typically a good source of fiber-an essential nutrient 95 percent of us don't get enough of. Not only is fiber great for our digestive and gut health, but it also helps slow our body's roll when breaking down fruit sugar, so we don't experience the same sugar high we would if we had eaten candy or cookies instead. Most products with added sugars don't contain fiber, which allows for insulin spikes and leaves you hungry again an hour later. </p>
<p> Fruit is also a wonderful source of vitamins, minerals and powerful antioxidants that ward of inflammation and chronic diseases. The antioxidant power of apples, for example, fights off several types of cancer-maybe an apple a day really keeps the doctor away after all. And those bananas people compare to donuts are good sources of potassium, B vitamins, and Vitamin C. </p>
<p> What a nutritionist says: </p>
<p> We talked to EatingWell's nutrition editor Lisa Valente to get her thoughts on eating fruit: </p>
<p> "It's one of my biggest dietitian pet peeves that people think fruit is unhealthy because it has sugar. I hear it all the time about bananas especially, but everything from blueberries to oranges have gotten a bad reputation," she says. </p>
<p> What about for someone who is watching their carb intake? </p>
<p> "If you need to watch your sugar or carb intake, you may want to be more careful about portioning out your fruit but it doesn't mean you shouldn't eat it. Try pairing fruit with a healthy fat or protein, like apple and almond butter, banana and peanut butter or pear and cheese," adds Valente. </p>
<p> "Eating fruit hasn't been linked with higher blood sugar, even for people with diabetes (learn more about fruit and diabetes here)." </p>
<p> Is fresh fruit the best option? </p>
<p> "Dried fruit, canned fruit and frozen fruit might have added sugar, so check the labels. If you buy plain versions with just fruit as an ingredient it can be a really affordable way to add more fruit to your diet. I especially like frozen fruit for smoothies and dried fruit for snacking," she notes. </p>
<p> "The benefits to eating fruit definitely outweigh any downsides. Fruit has so many great nutritional qualities and it just happens to taste good. That's a win-win in my book." </p>

<p> History of Brahmin diet </p>
<p> Lacto-Vegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism[1] although there is a wide variety of practices and beliefs that have changed over time because with the spiritual practices satvik food is more recommended by saints .[2] By one estimate, 30% of all Hindus are ovo-lacto vegetarians.[3][4] Most surveys, including one by the Office of Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, show 60% to 70% or even more of Indians eat meat.[5][6][7] Most sects of Hindus do not observe vegetarianism.[8] Dietary habits and dietary customs were factors that have played roles in the formation, evolution and development of Indian caste system.[9] </p>
<p> Vedic texts strongly encourage minimal violence and cruelty instead they give more importance to vegetarian food. The Atharveda (6.140) (one of the four Vedas) mentions that "rice , wheat, barley, sesamum" are the food types allotted for human consumption. </p>
<p> Manusmiriti (5.51-52) says there is no greater sinner than the man who makes his flesh thrive on someone else's. </p>
<p> These scriptures unambiguously support the meatless way of life. In the Mahabharata, for instance, the great warrior Bhishma explains to Yudhishtira, eldest of the Pandava princes that the foolish person who eats the meat of animals must be considered the vilest of human beings [Mahabharata, Anu 114.11]. The eating of ‘dirty’ food, it warns, is not as terrible as the eating of flesh [Mahabharata, Shanti. 141.88] </p>
<p> Several highly authoritative scriptures also bar violence against domestic animals except in the case of ritual sacrifice. This view is clearly expressed in the Mahabharata (3.199.11-12;[10] 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17), the Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13-14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1). For instance, many Hindus point to the Mahabharata's maxim that "Nonviolence is the highest duty and the highest teaching. It is also reflected in the Manu Smriti (5.27-44), a particularly renowned traditional Hindu law book (Dharmaśāstra). </p>
<p> Starting from the last few centuries B.C., Buddhism and Jainism contributed much to the belief that nonviolence is supremely valued which stimulated growing hostility to the slaughter of live animals. </p>
<p> Practitioners' views on Brahmin vegetarianism[edit] </p>
<p> As opposed to the popular views propagated by non-practicing Western and Indian sociologists and Indologists, the notion of Brahmin vegetarianism is not directly due to the influence of Buddhism or Jainism.[citation needed] Buddhism could not itself influence its followers to adhere to the idea of total ahimsa as most Buddhists from the times of the Buddha until today are meat eaters. Theravada Buddhist tradition interprets the last meal of Buddha offered by Cunda to be pork, to which they attach no stigma or see no violation of the ahinsa principle. Buddhist vegetarianism is a rare concept even in Buddhist countries like Myanmar and Thailand. Even Buddhism's most famous patron, Emperor Ashoka, did not ban killing of animals and birds in entirety. Rather, Ashoka's animal welfare policies only restricted the species of animals that can be killed for food in addition to banning ritual sacrifices of animals on the premise that it is wasteful. Vegetarianism never was a principle to be strictly adhered to in Buddhism and no social stigma was attached to Buddhists who ate meat even in India, the land of its origin. This is reasonably clear from the fact that the austerities of Jainism which includes the strictest form of vegetarianism long pre-dated Buddha's birth and did not apparently influence Buddha's eating habits after his enlightenment. Buddha and Buddhists continued to eat meat so long they were assured that the animal was not killed specifically for the feeding the bhikshus </p>
<p> Vegetarianism is generally true for the pancha-dravida brahmins like Iyers, Iyengars, Namboothiris, Telugu Brahmins of all sub-sects, Kannada Brahmins, Maharashtra, Gujarati, and Rajasthani Brahmins. It is not as generally true for the pancha-gauda brahmins of North and East India. It is well known that the Bengali Brahmins are meat eaters. While the Brahmins of the Ganga, Yamuna belt west of Bengal are generally vegetarians, we do see exceptions. Bhumihar Brahmins are well known for ritual sacrifice and are meat eaters.Kashmiri Brahmins are also meat eaters. </p>
<p> The greatest influence on Brahmin diet has, by far, been the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, which expounded the theory and practice of "Rajyoga". While there have been other schools of yog, Raj yog gained the greatest prominence as it is suitable for a practitioner to remain a householder and yet transcend the eight stages of yoga Ashtanga (eight limbs of yoga). Although ahinsa, among others, is mentioned as a part of yama, the first step of ashthanga yoga paddhati, it is generally viewed as an abstinence of mental animosity towards any living creature as one of the means to achieve stillness of mind. The concept of ahinsa has never been taken as an end in itself and certainly not to the level of the moral strictures of the Jains. Killing pests, dangerous animals and enemies of the nation are seen as virtuous acts as opposed to the hands-off philosophy of the Jains. General masses adopt the philosophies of Buddhism, Jainism and Vedanta interchangeably in a culture that integrated the Jain religion and deified Buddha in to the Hindu pantheon. </p>
<p> The proliferation of Raj yog also brought with it the notions of spiritual purity of various kinds of food and their importance in practitioners' life. Various foods are categorized along the lines of the gunas that impact the spiritual progress of the practitioner. Accordingly, food is classified as Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas based on the observed impact they have on spiritual progress. Sattvic diet is a diet based on foods in Ayurveda and Yog literature that contain sattva quality (guna). In this system of dietary classification, foods that harm the mind or body are considered Tamasic, while those that are neither positive or negative are considered Rajasic. Sattvic diet is meant to include food and eating habit that is "pure, essential, natural, vital, energy-containing, clean, conscious, true, honest, wise". Sattvic diet is a regimen that places emphasis on seasonal foods, fruits, dairy products, nuts, seeds, oils, ripe vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and non-meat based proteins. Some Sattvic diet suggestions, such as its relative emphasis on dairy products, is controversial. Sattvic diet is sometimes referred to as yogic diet in modern literature. In ancient and medieval era Yog literature, the concept discussed is Mitahara, which literally means "moderation in eating". </p>
<p> Since the Brahmins are ordained to follow a lifestyle that ensures the spiritual progress of themselves and that of the society, they have adopted Sattvic diet. Kshatriyas and others who need to be physically and mentally engaged in the worldly affairs are allowed non-Sattvic diet, although they can choose to be vegetarians. For example, Vishwamitra, meat-eating Kshatriya, took to austerities as he aspired to become a Brahmarshi, whereas Parasurama, a brahmana, remained actively engaged in his war against the Kshatriyas. </p>
<p> Recent research indicating pre-Śramaṇa origins[edit] </p>
<p> While the yoga sutras of Patanjali are dated somewhere between 500 B.C. to 400 C.E., Patanjali was not the founder of the yogic school of philosophy. Rather, Patanjali drew upon the Vedantic literature Like the Upanishads and Samkhya philosophy both of which have Vedic roots. The influence of Samkhya on yoga sutras is so great that some scholars preferred not to distinguish yoga as separate from Samkhya, rather presented it as another form of Samkhya. More recent scholarship establishes the origins of Samkhya in the vicinity of 1500 B.C. noting its influence on Buddhist and Yoga schools of Indian philosophy.[12][13][14] </p>

<p> Do Horses Eat Meat? 7 Important Facts (Explained For Beginners) </p>
<p> You have probably wondered whether a horse can eat meat. Horses are big and strong animals, after all, and it would seem natural for them to gain strength from a juicy piece of meat. </p>
<p> Do Horses Ever Eat Meat? </p>
<p> Horses are herbivores which means they eat plants and hay. Only in Iceland will people feed horses dried fish to give them more proteins. The digestive system of horses is geared toward eating plans and hay and should not have to process meat. </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> Why Do Horses Not Eat Meat? </p>
<p> It may seem strange that such a big and strong animal as a horse can live on plants in hay alone. After all, they are often working hard all day and we tend to think that such labor requires meat in order to develop the muscles and sustain the animal. </p>
<p> But that’s simply not the case. </p>
<p> You can say that horses are vegetarians. </p>
<p> They eat what is categorized as “primary producers”. Primary producers are organisms that are turning the heat from the sun into energy through photosynthesis. This is a constant and ongoing process in plants such as grass and flowers. </p>
<p> Horses prefer to eat hay and they will also eventually eat grass and other green plants. Horses have flat teeth that are perfectly made for chewing plants and grass. </p>
<p> That doesn’t mean that your horse will never eat anything that’s animal-based. </p>
<p> The digestion system of the horse works well with food that’s high on fiber and not high on proteins. They have small stomachs and they cannot store big loads of food in them. So they have to eat often and in smaller portions. </p>
<p> Once in a while, your horse will need some sort of supplements that are based on proteins or other animal-based food. You will also find that the foal will drink milk from the mother which is full of proteins. It’s important for the small horse to get the rich proteins from the mother’s milk in order to develop strong and healthy bones. </p>
<p> What if my horse likes meat? </p>
<p> You might find that a horse likes the smell and taste meet. But that doesn’t mean that you should feed it meat. It’s simply not good for their digestive systems. They have been bred and formed by nature to have a digestion system that is based on eating plans and hay. </p>
<p> Horses will often like the smell of human food. Also when it contains meat. This is because we eat food that is processed and flavored and the horse like the smell of it just like you and I. </p>
<p> But is typically the flavor and sauce around the meet they are attracted to. Just like a horse would love a bite of your hotdog. It does taste good because we add a lot of extra taste and flavor to the product. </p>
<p> So the next time you will wonder if you should let your horse taste your leftovers, you will need to get rid of the meat first. Feed that to the dog instead. It will love a nice piece of meat and it has the teeth and the stomach to process meat. </p>
<p> The teeth of horses are made for plants </p>
<p> Animals who eat meat have sharper teeth in order to chew and bite the meat. </p>
<p> The teeth of the horse are not sharp and they wouldn’t do much good against a tough piece of meat. </p>
<p> Here you can see a set of horse teeth compared to the sharper set of teeth from Lion’s mouth. As you can see, the teeth are completely flat when you compare them to the long sharp teeth of the Lion. </p>
<p> They are made for chewing plans and they will do no good against a solid piece of meat! </p>
<p> This is also why you should never feed your horse a slice of meat. It doesn’t have the sharp teeth to eat it and it will not be able to turn the meat into little pieces. </p>
<p> What Would Happen If A Horse Ate Meat? </p>
<p> Probably nothing. The parts of the meat that can’t be processed by the digestive system will just be processed out of the body. A horse can eat smaller rodents and birds and they will typically not try to eat bigger slices of meat. </p>
<p> If your horse has grabbed a piece off your hotdog or another tiny piece of meat, it’s normally no trouble at all. </p>
<p> It’s a big animal and a little piece of meat should do no harm. But that doesn’t mean that you should let it taste it on purpose. You should keep the meat away from the horse because it might not be aware that it’s not good for it. Horses are intelligent creatures and they are curious. It might want to eat it even though it cannot digest it. </p>
<p> It might like it at first because most of the food we eat is pretty salty. So it tastes good in the mouth of the horse but it’s not meant for it. Processed food is not the best option for either the horse or other animals. </p>
<p> You just need to watch the animal carefully if you suspect that your horse has been eating a lot of meat you probably need to take it to the vet. </p>
<p> You will need a professional opinion if you suspect that your horse has become sick or in other ways is affected by eating meat. </p>
<p> It’s simply always better to be safe than sorry, especially with a large animal such as a horse. </p>
<p> Do WILD Horses Eat Meat? </p>
<p> Wild horses, on the other hand, have often been observed to eat other smaller animals. But they probably do so in order to survive. It’s not that easy to always find fresh food when you are living in the wild. </p>
<p> Just like other wild herbivores, such as deers, a wild horse will eventually eat smaller pieces of meat. It could be rodents or birds. </p>
<p> No harm is done from a horse eating a little mouse or another tiny animal. It might catch that little fella for sport and it might also eat it occasionally </p>
<p> But you will never see a wild pack of horses eating a bigger dead animal. They are not predators such as big cats like tigers and jaguars. They roam together because they are flock animals and because there are some benefits from doing so when it comes to survival. Even though it could seem otherwise. </p>
<p> But wild horses can show omnivory behavior once in a while. </p>
<p> We have also found stories about Bedouins feeding their horses meat whenever there was no green grass to be found. They would typically keep dry camel meat and feed it to the horse along with other things such as honey. </p>
<p> Wild horses live in flocks but not in order to hunt other animals. They do so in order to survive the attack of other predators. Because as you might know, horses do have natural enemies such as bears, alligators, big cats, etc. </p>
<p> We also find several occurrences of wild animals attacking horses here in the US. It’s actually not as uncommon as you would think. Here’s everything you should know about how to keep your horse safe from predatory animals. </p>
<p> So What Do Horses Eat? </p>
<p> Horses eat a majority of hay. They prefer grass and that’s also what they eat in the wild. They will also eat stuff like carrots and fruits. It’s important for a horse to get a good and diverse diet. </p>
<p> If you want to give your horse a treat here’s a few options you can try: </p>
<p> As you can see all these things are primarily fruits and vegetables. These are all good things for your horse and it will love you for it. </p>
<p> It’s also a good way to get a horse to like you. Let’s say you want to approach a wild horse. One of the best ways is to bring an apple and to come at it from an angle at the front. </p>

<p> Hot flashes after eating or drinking: Causes and treatment tips </p>
<p> If you have ever had hot flashes after eating or drinking, you are not alone. This is something that many people experience yet may not fully understand, especially when it comes to the cause. Here we take a look at what getting hot flashes after eating could mean and how to get rid of them. </p>
<p> Hot flashes are usually caused by a hormonal imbalance and are common when a woman goes through menopause. In fact, studies show that three out of four menopausal women experience hot flashes. Some people have menopause hot flashes after eating while others have hot flashes related to endocrinal disorders. The most common condition associated with this is diabetes. </p>
<p> The problem with hot flashes is that they can be uncomfortable and in some cases, embarrassing. The embarrassment is usually a result of the sweating that a person just can’t control. </p>
<p> What does a hot flash feel like? </p>
<p> For those who have not experienced sweating after eating or hot flashes during menopause, it can be hard to imagine. While the symptoms do vary from person to person, they typically include a sudden sensation of heat and flushing followed by perspiration. Other signs include trembling, confusion, and general weakness. </p>
<p> What causes hot flashes after eating? </p>
<p> Sweating after eating a meal has been the subject of much research, yet the exact cause is still a mystery. We do know that hot flashes occur when estrogen decreases in the female body. You could say that this disrupts a woman’s internal thermostat. This is a phenomenon associated with menopause. </p>
<p> Certain foods and drink or even eating a large meal can also bring on hot flashes. For instance, hot flashes after eating spicy food are not unusual. Caffeine and alcohol are also known to cause hot flashes. The heat sensation normally occurs in healthy adults only if their blood sugar level drops below 60mg/dl. It is important to know that although there are common triggers when it comes to eating, foods that cause hot flashes can vary drastically from one person to another. </p>
<p> Research indicates that anytime body temperature is elevated, it’s possible for a person to experience a hot flash. Hot foods, for example, can dilate blood vessels and stimulate nerve endings. As a result, the body feels warmer. Diabetics can be hypoglycemic after eating, which can cause hot flashes. We can’t blame everything on a meal though. In other words, hot flashes after eating and drinking are only part of the possible culprits. Some people experience hot flashes when they are stressed out or are having an allergic reaction. Andropause is another possible cause, but in men. Similar to menopause, andropause is a hormonal change in men that can trigger hot flashes after eating. </p>
<p> Foods to avoid hot flashes </p>
<p> A lot of people want to know how to get rid of hot flashes. There is no quick answer, especially since not everyone has the same triggers. Still, the following list can act as a guideline for those who want to avoid foods that cause hot flashes. </p>
<p> It may be obvious why spicy foods and alcohol are on the list, but high carb foods like white bread and pasta are particularly hard on women who are going through menopause. It can make their symptoms worse and, of course, those symptoms include the hot flashes and moodiness. Too much sugar can also further aggravate menopause. </p>
<p> Foods to help reduce hot flashes </p>
<p> So if there are foods that can cause or aggravate hot flashes, then there must be foods that can help reduce hot flashes. If this is your thinking then you are correct. For instance, studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in vegetables and fresh fruit, can result in a 20 percent less likelihood of getting hot flashes and night sweats. </p>
<p> The following list includes foods that help reduce hot flashes, including some food items that you would find in the Mediterranean diet. </p>
<p> Scientists believe that fruits, vegetables, and whole grains provide a good amount of fiber, which is a nutrient that has been linked to estrogen fluctuations. The theory is that by stabilizing blood levels of the hormones insulin and cortisol, you won’t get variability in estrogen and therefore you won’t get symptoms like hot flashes. The Mediterranean diet, which features fruits, veggies, and whole grains, is considered lower on the glycemic index. That is how it can control blood sugar spikes and menopause–like symptoms. </p>
<p> How to get rid of hot flashes after eating </p>
<p> Treating hot flashes depends largely on what is causing them. In many cases, it’s a matter of regulating blood sugar levels. Normal lifestyle modifications, which include diet, exercise, avoiding tobacco, and wearing loose cotton clothing, are included. </p>
<p> One of the best things you can do is make sure that you have a balanced diet that includes essential nutrients and vitamins. Avoiding processed foods and triggers like spicy and oily foods will go a long way in curbing symptoms. Many people also find that drinking plenty of water helps keep the body cool. Studies show that a regular exercise routine is helpful in addressing body temperature issues. </p>
<p> There are medications and supplements that can help reduce hot flashes. For example, hormone replacement therapy is an option, but it is controversial and is something that requires discussion with a doctor. Some women have reported relief from symptoms after taking gabapentin and pregabalin. These are medications that are designed to relieve nerve-mediated pain. Antidepressants have also been used to alleviate hot flashes but again, any medication requires careful consideration. For those who want to avoid drugs acupuncture could be an option. Research reveals that it can be helpful in reducing hot flashes, as well as other symptoms associated with menopause. </p>
<p> Hot flashes after eating, drinking, or simply due to menopause can be at the least annoying and at most, terribly uncomfortable. Some people experience severe hot flashes that lead to headaches and dizziness. In these cases, a doctor should be consulted just to rule out any underlying medical problems. For the most part, people have little to be concerned about and come to realize that small lifestyle adjustments can be very helpful in relieving the heat sensations and sweats that are characteristic of hot flashes. </p>

<p> How Can I Tell If Food Left at Room Temperature Is Safe to Eat? </p>
<p> Thanks to the miracle of modern refrigeration, we’re able to keep perishable foods longer and no longer have to go shopping every single day for fresh food. Though most of us probably don’t think about how amazing that is on a regular basis, we definitely pay attention when something goes wrong. If you’ve ever gotten a mouthful of chunky, spoiled milk or eaten a mayonnaise-based salad that sat in the sun too long at a picnic and later got sick because of it, you realize quickly that our ability to keep foods in cold storage is a really big deal. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So how long is too long to keep food at room temperature that’s supposed to be refrigerated? Here are a few things to keep in mind: </p>
<p> How long has been out of the fridge? </p>
<p> According to the USDA, put perishable foods in the refrigerator within two hours of purchasing it. If it’s above 90 degrees, then you only have an hour, so hop to it. This also goes for serving foods at a dinner, picnic, or other event where you have dishes sitting out for prolonged periods. If that’s the case, also try serving the perishable item in a container that is nestled in a bowl of ice. </p>
<p> It is a potentially hazardous food? </p>
<p> Potentially hazardous foods exist in a form capable of supporting rapid and progressive growth of microorganisms, according to Princeton University’s Environmental Health and Safety department. Examples include any food which consists in whole or in part of milk or milk products, eggs, meat, poultry, rice, fish, shellfish, and edible crustaceans. These foods in particular need to be served at safe temperatures. Per Princeton: </p>
<p> “All potentially hazardous food should be kept below 41oF (for cold foods) or above 135oF (for hot foods) except during necessary preparation time or a short display period. Hot or cold holding equipment may be required to store and display food during an event. A food thermometer is also required if potentially hazardous foods will be served.” </p>
<p> Has it entered the food danger zone? </p>
<p> Food left out for too long at room temperature is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella to grow to dangerous levels that can cause illness. According to the USDA: </p>
<p> “Bacteria grow most rapidly in the range of temperatures between 40°F and 140°F, doubling in number in as little as 20 minutes. This range of temperatures is often called the ‘Danger Zone.’” </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> When in doubt, throw it out </p>
<p> Not only does this rhyme, but it’s really important. If it’s a potentially hazardous food, err on the side of caution. Having the last few spoons of chicken salad isn’t worth getting sick over. </p>

<p> I rarely keep cooked food in the fridge. I keep rice, cooked meat, soups, leftovers and so on regularly at room temperature for more than 48 hours without a problem and I am alive and well... I find north Americans' obsession with food safety a bit excessive. </p>

<p> When in Doubt, Throw it Out! </p>
<p> You cannot always see or smell bacterial contamination. Mold that appears to be growing only on the surface may grow invisible roots into softer foods. Do not rely on a visual inspection or "smell test" to tell you whether or not a food is safe. It's not worth the risk - food poisoning can be much, much worse than an upset stomach. </p>
<p> The Danger Zone </p>
<p> Per the USDA guidelines, potentially hazardous food that stays in the temperature "danger zone", 40-140 °F (4-60 °C), for more than 2 hours should be discarded. For temperatures above 90°F (32°C), the limit is 1 hour.* </p>
<p> Potentially hazardous foods are those foods that spoil most easily, such as unshelled eggs, raw meats, fish, shell fish, dairy products, almost all cooked foods. </p>
<p> This time is cumulative, so it includes time bringing the food home from the grocery store, time before cooking, time after cooking, and so on. The reason is that while cooking may destroy bacteria or other pathogens, it doesn't always destroy the toxins that they have produced. </p>
<p> In general, regarding perishable foods like meat, most dairy, unshelled eggs and shell eggs (in the US), cooked casseroles, and so on: if the food (or its perishable components) have been at room temperature for more than two hours, you should discard that food. </p>
<p> To avoid the danger zone, keep cooked food hot until ready to eat, then refrigerate immediately. Separate large items into smaller containers to help them to cool more quickly. If you’re defrosting something, do it in the fridge or under cold running water. </p>
<p> If you can be certain that the food was not in the danger zone, then yes, it is safe. For example, if you left a large chunk of frozen meat out and it is still frozen solid (including the surface) when you come back to it, it was not in the danger zone. </p>
<p> Why is it so strict? / Why didn't I get sick? </p>
<p> These guidelines are about making sure you don't get a foodborne illness, i.e. reducing the risk to where it's so small as to not be an issue. So if you break the rules, e.g. eating food that's been left at room temperature for 8 hours, that doesn't mean you will get sick, just that you're taking a risk. </p>
<p> Why does cooking not completely "reset the clock"? </p>
<p> Some bacteria leave behind harmful protein toxins that cannot be "killed" (denatured) by cooking. Cooking food is only effective against live organisms, not their toxic waste products. Spoiled food cannot be cooked back to safety and must be discarded. </p>
<p> Cooking is pasteurization, not sterilization. Pasteurization means killing most microbes, so as to render the food safe for human consumption. Sterilization methods (e.g. pressure-canning and irradiation) are the only safe methods for longer-term room-temperature storage. Otherwise, the danger zone rules always apply. </p>
<p> Even sterilized food can only remain sterile under an airtight seal, e.g. when properly canned or vacuum-sealed. Once it is opened, it is no longer sterile. Air contains countless bacteria and molds, and their spores, which will readily re-colonize any suitable environment they encounter. Cooked food tends to be an ideal medium for growth. </p>
<p> What can I leave out longer? </p>
<p> For foods that aren't potentially hazardous as described above, there's no solid rule, but things are generally safe for much longer than the 2 hours given above. For example, things which are sold at room temperature (e.g. fresh produce, bread, or cookies) are most likely safe at least all day or overnight if not for days or even months. You can find guidelines for common things at StillTasty. </p>
<p> Regulation and Risks </p>
<p> Follow the guidelines set out by reputable regulatory agencies, especially when serving others. Local organizations include: </p>
<p> Other regulatory sources apply in other parts of the word, but major food safety organizations usually agree in essence (if not in complete detail) on most issues. </p>
<p> Failure to follow reputable guidelines is irresponsible if you are serving guests, and failure to follow your specific local codes is likely to be illegal if you are serving customers. </p>
<p> Health codes tend to be very conservative, to fully protect the community. You have the right to take risks on yourself by ignoring their recommendations, but please do not risk the safety of others. </p>
<p> Again, When in Doubt... </p>
<p> Once again, if you suspect spoilage or contamination, please, throw it out. </p>
<p> * Note: this is the USDA's rule. Other agencies may have variations on it. Additionally, government agencies generally make very conservative recommendations - they're trying to make sure that no one who follows the rules gets sick. Breaking the rules means maybe taking on some risk. That's up to you - just remember, eventually someone gets unlucky, and food poisoning is not fun. </p>
<p> It's also a good idea to keep a thermometer in your fridge. They typically don't have built-in temperature readings, and you may be inadvertently endangering yourself and your guests. The appropriate temperatures are discussed here: cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/12013/… – Steve Jun 14 '13 at 4:35 </p>

<p> I strongly disagree on dairy. In many European countries cheeses are sold at room temperature and are absolutely fine to eat, and you can definitely keep it out of the fridge for more than two hours with no issue whatsoever. Preserved meat (salami, ham and in general Charcuterie) can be kept in a cool place outside of the fridge for months with no problem. In summary, you cannot generalize. – nico Jun 14 '13 at 6:24 </p>

<p> @Steve absolutely! My fridge went on the blink last month, but it didn't stop working it just sneakily got warmer. Our first clue was milk kept spoiling. I now own two fridge thermometers, for fridge and freezer. ~$5 each, well worth it. – Mark Allen Oct 15 '13 at 20:27 </p>

<p> Perhaps this answer should be clarified to point out that the "danger zone" applies to the food's temperature and not to the ambient temp around the food. For instance, if you set some frozen meat out to defrost at room temperature, it hasn't gone bad after sitting for two hours. It's probably still frozen solid at that point. The "danger zone" timer is only ticking when the food's internal temperature is between 40 and 140°F. Similarly, putting warm food in a fridge/freezer doesn't immediately stop the clock, as it takes some time for the food's internal temperature to drop. – aroth Sep 12 '15 at 12:30 </p>

<p> Rules like this are devoted to big distribution, food industry, public restaurants etc. That a bowl soup is dangerous after a couple of hours in my kitchen is ridiculous. They are kinda laws and have regulatory purpose. It is not a kitchen book. Still the answer is good as for it provides guidelines. But it should be taken with one, even two, grains of salt. – Alchimista Dec 23 '18 at 8:52 </p>
<p> The question was: "If I left food out of the refrigerator for some period of time, is it still safe? If I left it out too long, can I salvage it by cooking it more?" </p>
<p> Answer: It depends ... </p>
<p> How long did you leave it outside the fridge? </p>
<p> What kind of food are we talking about? </p>
<p> What is the moisture content of the food and the humidity of the air in the room? </p>
<p> Is the air reasonably clean. Did you put it on a clean or contaminated surface? </p>
<p> Is it raw or cooked food? </p>
<p> These are just a couple of questions so you get the general idea that it really is impossible to give a generalized answer to the question. </p>
<p> Considering that only a surprisingly small percentage of the worlds population actually has access to refrigerators and people still eat I think it might be obvious that refrigeration is really not the only way to store food for later consumption. </p>
<p> For a more in depth study of the topic I recommend: Food Safety: The Science of Keeping Food Safe By Ian C. Shaw </p>
<p> As a more general tip I would stick to common sense. e.g. any food containing raw eggs (Mayonnaise) or food that must by its nature be considered contaminated (store bought raw chicken / raw meat) needs to be handled in a reasonable matter (you should be able to find the correct advise about handling these kinds of foods in any good cookbook) to avoid colonisation to an unhealthy (when eaten - even after cooking) point. On the other end of the spectrum leafy vegetables or fruit bought fresh from a farmers market actually comes with its own protection in the form of beneficial bacteria on the skin and is therefore less likely to be easily (meaning in a short time) colonized by pathogenetic organisms. Learn about your food and learn how to cook and you probably will be safe. </p>
<p> Anecdotally, I routinely leave (vegetarian) dishes out, not just for two hours but overnight, and have observed that they're always fine. Unless they've been exposed to human saliva, in which case they're furry in the morning, or it's the middle of summer and the house isn't cooled, my observations lead me to believe that a lot of dishes are fine sitting out to cool. (I developed this habit when I had a fussy and ancient fridge, which would labor whenever hot foods were placed in it.) I would never leave, say, fresh homemade mayonnaise out, but a pot of curried chickpeas? No problem. – goblinbox Jun 24 '15 at 21:12 </p>
<p> I left two bags of groceries in the car overnight. A beef shoulder roast, a pork loin, pack of ground beef and some smoked sausage. They were cold to the touch. That was our food for the week. Not sure what I should do. </p>
<p> The rule of thumb (and of the USDA) is: after two hours in the "danger zone" - temperatures between 5-60c/40-140f - the food has to go. That's the official answer and the only responsible one. </p>
<p> But it's indeed a one-size-fits-all-play-it-safe rule. Bacteria's growth rate rises with temperature until they start dying around 60c/140f. Two hours in a humid 40c/105f will turn fresh meat into a small civilization. But under 10c/50f there'll hardly be a change. </p>
<p> So as Kate Gregory wrote, the question is where you are, and how cold is it over there. If your food was left covered in cold "storage" temperatures, and in the morning felt cold and firm to the touch and smelled fine, it has stayed unspoiled. Problem is: you can't know. I still might be unsafe. Not all food spoilage shows or smells. </p>
<p> Still, if you consider taking the risk, you should always throw away the ground beef. Bacteria grows on the surface of foods. According to common sense, you can make a wholesome piece of meat safe by cooking it and sterilize its surface (only that here you need to be guided not by common sense but by a health expert). But either way - in ground meat the outside and the inside are mixed, and any contamination on the meat was spread all across it before the fearful night. So give up the ground meat and </p>
<p> If I left food out of the refrigerator for some period of time, is it still safe? </p>
<p> It all depends on measures you have taken to prevent spoiling. There a fair few types of charcuterie that is aged for anywhere from a week to several months. So in a general sense yes CERTAIN foods can be safe to eat even when not refrigerated. The thing is these foods have been prepared in a manner that prevents harmful bacteria from growing. </p>
<p> Salami for instance uses salt to cure the sausage and then also adds further acidity to the environment by the addition of wine. This ensure that harmful bacteria is unlikely to grow. </p>
<p> Biltong and to a lesser extent Jerky as well is pieces of meat that is cured in salt and then to remove the salt a vinegar bath is used to also add further acidity and reduce water content of the meat. </p>
<p> These examples seem to be the exception though as it seems you want to know if food that is not specifically prepared for long term curing is safe to leave outside and to that I would say a resounding NO. </p>

<p> How Long After Dental Implants Can I Eat Normally? </p>
<p> Dental implants are the gold standard for permanent tooth replacement, giving patients the confidence and functionality to smile, speak, eat, and laugh– just as they would with a set of healthy, natural teeth. Because implants need time to integrate with the jawbone after placement, patients are asked to restrict their diets after surgery to avoid disrupting the osseointegration process. </p>
<p> Osseointegration is the fusing of living bone with the titanium implant. In general, osseointegration occurs gradually over four weeks to six months, depending on the health of the bone tissue and the location of the implants. If undue pressure is put on the implants by chewing hard or crunchy foods too early in the healing process, the bone fusion could be compromised, leading to premature failure. </p>
<p> What foods can you eat after surgery for dental implants, and how long after the procedure can patients eat and chew normally? Find out below. </p>
<p> What can you eat right after dental implant surgery? </p>
<p> In the immediate 24-48 hours after dental implant surgery, your mouth will be sore and swollen. During this time frame, it’s essential to be gentle with yourself and stick to soft, room-temperature foods. While soups are recommended, be sure they are not scalding, as hot temperatures can worsen any residual bleeding. </p>
<p> Here at Long Island Implant & Cosmetic Dentistry, we recommend the following for the first 1-2 days post-surgery: </p>
<p> Applesauce </p>
<p> Fruit smoothies </p>
<p> Cold or lukewarm soups </p>
<p> Yogurt </p>
<p> Plenty of liquids to replenish electrolytes and stay hydrated </p>
<p> Steer clear of these foods after implants </p>
<p> In the following days and weeks, you can incorporate a much broader variety of soft foods, but it’s crucial to avoid the following for at least six weeks, which can undermine the healing process: </p>
<p> Raw, crunchy vegetables or corn on the cob </p>
<p> Sticky foods, such as toffee or caramel </p>
<p> Spicy foods containing hot peppers or cayenne </p>
<p> Highly acidic foods, like tomatoes and citrus fruit </p>
<p> Crunchy, hard foods like popcorn, granola, pretzels, nuts, chips, or candy </p>
<p> Chewy foods, such as gummy bears, dried fruit, or bagels </p>
<p> Food and beverages that are extremely cold or hot </p>
<p> Transitioning into a normal diet </p>
<p> A diet of soft, relatively bland foods should be adhered to as long as your dentist recommends, and the longer you can leave the surgical site undisturbed, the better your chances of successful dental implant surgery. By weeks 2 and 3, after implant placement, you can begin incorporating some of the following solid foods into your daily meal plans. Try and include protein-rich foods– such as yogurt, eggs, tofu, meats, and cheese– to help expedite your recovery. </p>
<p> When preparing pasta, meats, or vegetables, be sure to cook them until they are fork-tender and easy to cut and chew: </p>
<p> Eggs </p>
<p> Avocadoes </p>
<p> Sweet potatoes </p>
<p> Fruits like bananas, pears, and peaches (avoid fruit with small seeds) </p>
<p> After the jawbone has successfully fused with the titanium implant, you can go back to your normal diet and enjoy your favorite foods. Because the healing process varies from patient to patient, this is a highly individual time frame, which can be 3 to 6 months. While this may seem like a long time to forego caramel popcorn or your go-to chips, the beautiful results will be more than worth the wait! </p>
<p> The good news is that– even with these restrictions– there is a plethora of delicious foods that can be enjoyed during your recovery process! </p>

<doc id="file21599525" filename="how-long-eat-food-after-expiration-date" parent_folder="web2" url="https://www.eatthis.com/how-long-eat-food-after-expiration-date/">
<p> When was the last time you threw out food because it was "expired" before you could enjoy it? If you're like most Americans, it was today. Yep, the average U.S. citizen tosses almost a pound of food a day, according to a 2018 PLoS ONE study. But we've all been taught to think it's unsafe to eat expired food, right? </p>
<p> "Food waste drives me crazy even in my own household," says Bonnie Taub-Dix, RDN, a dietitian based in New York City, creator of BetterThanDieting.com, and author of Read it Before You Eat It: Taking You from Label to Table. "I can't tell you how many times my kids have said, 'Is this still good?' about something that had an expiration date for that day! (And of course, they want me to taste it first.)" </p>
<p> Wondering what the answer is to the same question Taub-Dix's kids—and so many of us—ask? So were we. So we turned to the experts just how long you can (or should) eat food after its expiration date. But first, we should define exactly what an expiration date is. </p>
<p> What's the definition of an expiration date? </p>
<p> Here's some shocking but true news: those date claims are often regulated by no one but the food brands themselves. "The FDA does not require manufacturers to place expiration or use by dates on food products except for infant formulas," says Deborah Kotz, press officer for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. "Some state and local agencies require expiration dates on certain food labels, but most often, manufacturers voluntarily include expiration or use-by dates." </p>
<p> In fact, one Harvard researcher likened these non-regulated dates to "the Wild West." So what do these far-from-scientific terms truly mean? Here's a debrief from the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service: </p>
<p> Best by: For consumers; a sign of when flavor or quality is at its peak. This has no relation to food safety. </p>
<p> Sell by: For the store; a sign for how long to keep a product on shelves. This has no relation to food safety. </p>
<p> Use by: For consumers; a sign of when to use a product by for the best quality. This has no relation to food safety. </p>
<p> Notice a theme? </p>
<p> Confusion over these dates causes a whopping 90 percent of Americans to trash perfectly safe food, says a Food Marketing Institute survey. Common culprits include soup, eggs, dairy products, cereal, and bread. (Speaking of bread, have you read about the best place to store it?) </p>
<p> So, is it safe to eat expired food? </p>
<p> Because there is no clear-cut definition of an expiration date, New York City-based dietitian, Brooke Alpert, RD, author of The Diet Detox, explains that you can trust your instincts: "A good rule of thumb to follow is to use your senses; if something smells, feels, tastes, or looks bad, it probably is," says Alpert. "If you are not sure, always err on the side of caution to avoid foodborne illness." </p>
<p> Taub-Dix chimes in to explain that storage techniques are key when it comes to extending the shelf-life of your food. "If a product is stored properly, it should last beyond the date listed on the package. There is so much food waste in this country—it's sad how much good food gets thrown in the trash," she says. </p>
<p> How to extend a food's lifespan </p>
<p> "There's new legislation being proposed that will create nationwide rules for labeling food, clearing up the confusion between a date that might mean the food may not be at its optimal quality (tastewise) versus the date that means a product is unsafe to eat," Taub-Dix says. </p>
<p> "Keep prepackaged items and canned goods in cool dry storage, and their average shelf life is six months to one year." </p>
<p> "Buy fresh goods like produce and dairy in smaller quantities on a more regular basis, such as weekly, so you can use them up faster to avoid spoilage." </p>
<p> "Meal plan to minimize food waste. That way, you'll buy only what you need for the meals you are going to prepare." </p>
<p> "Purchase frozen fruits and veggies to avoid throwing away produce that goes bad before you are able to use it." </p>
<p> "Stock your pantry with healthy dried products like quinoa, black rice, dried lentils, and low-sodium beans so you have meal staples on-hand whenever you need them." </p>
<p> Savvy scientists continue to search for a better strategy to indicate food safety dates in a way that doesn't confuse consumers or lead to excess waste. A handful of brands in the U.K., including dairy company Arla Foods, are testing out a new sticker label called Mimica Touch. It goes from smooth to bumpy in the presence of product or temperature alterations that signal actual expiration. Until these technologies move stateside, remind yourself of the food safety guidelines and stick with the tried-and-true smell test. </p>

<p> THIS IS MY PERSONAL BLOG </p>
<p> How long from the time you eat food until you excrete it? </p>
<p> QUESTION: Digestion, how long does it take? How long does it take to digest food — from the time you eat it to the time you excrete it in stool? </p>
<p> ANSWER from Michael F. Picco, M.D: Digestion time varies depending on the individual. For most healthy adults, it’s usually between 24 and 72 hours. After you eat, it takes about six to eight hours for food to pass through your stomach and small intestine. Food then enters your large intestine (colon) for further digestion and absorption of water. Elimination of undigested food residue through the large intestine usually begins after a total of 24 hours. Complete elimination from the body may take several days. More if you’ve eaten a large quantity, or eaten heavy foods. You digest much more slowly with an overloaded system. Water is crucial to keep everything in motion. </p>
<p> That’s good to know. Four days ago I’d over-eaten some Tyson buffalo chicken bites and gave myself indigestion. I felt kind of stuffed for a few days afterward, so I only ate clear soups for 3 days. Even so, I was surprised to find myself eliminating much more than I thought I would while I was eating no solid food. I’m health conscious. I pay attention to what goes in my body and what comes out of my body. It made sense that the bowel movements I was having on Tuesday and Wednesday were from the meals I’d eaten Saturday and Sunday. Good to know. </p>
<p> I also stopped drinking water for a few days, so my digestive system slowed to a crawl. I just wasn’t thirsty. I felt fine and didn’t realize I was dehydrated. Eating processed food and being dehydrated is a recipe for constipation, which I’d never had before. My digestive system felt heavy and weighed down. A nurse friend suggested a tried and true fix: Mix 2 oz of milk of magnesia into 4 ounces of warmed prune juice. Nurses call this “a black and white.” Follow with 8 oz warm water (essential to success). Expect a bowel movement within 30 minutes to 6 hours. Milk of Magnesia is a saline laxative which means it acts by drawing water into the intestine to help gently pass the bowel movement. Keep sipping water to hydrate. </p>
<p> Knowing how long it takes for food to move through my body helps me make more informed eating choices. And discovering how crucial water is to keep everything flowing makes me more mindful to stay hydrated. </p>

<p> How Much Fruit Should You Eat per Day? </p>
<p> In fact, diets high in fruit are associated with all sorts of health benefits, including a decreased risk of many diseases. </p>
<p> However, some people are concerned with the sugar content of fruit and worry that eating too much of it may be harmful. </p>
<p> So how many servings of fruit should you eat each day to be healthy? And is it possible to eat too much? This article explores the current research on the topic. </p>
<p> Fruit Is Rich in Many Important Nutrients </p>
<p> The nutrient composition of fruit varies greatly among the different types, but all varieties contain important nutrients. </p>
<p> For starters, fruit tends to be high in vitamins and minerals. These include vitamin C, potassium and folate, of which many people don’t get enough (1, 2). </p>
<p> Eating fiber may help lower cholesterol, increase feelings of fullness and contribute to weight loss over time (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). </p>
<p> What’s more, fruits are loaded with antioxidants, which help fight free radicals that can damage cells. Eating a diet high in antioxidants may help slow aging and reduce the risk of disease (9, 10, 11). </p>
<p> Because different fruits contain different amounts of nutrients, it is important to eat a variety of them to maximize the health benefits. </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> Fruit is high in important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants. Eat many different types to get the most benefits. </p>
<p> Eating Fruit Can Help You Lose Weight </p>
<p> Fruits are high in nutrients and relatively low in calories, making them a great choice for those looking to lose weight. </p>
<p> What’s more, they are high in water and fiber, which help you feel full. </p>
<p> Because of this, you can typically eat fruit until you’re satisfied, without consuming a lot of calories. </p>
<p> In fact, multiple studies indicate that eating fruit is associated with lower calorie intake and may contribute to weight loss over time (12, 13, 14, 15). </p>
<p> Apples and citrus fruits, like oranges and grapefruit, are among the most filling (16). </p>
<p> It is also important to note that whole, solid fruit is much more filling than puréed fruit or juice, which you can typically consume a lot of without feeling full (17). </p>
<p> Studies show that drinking a lot of fruit juice is linked with increased calorie intake and may increase your risk of obesity and other serious diseases (18, 19, 20, 21, 22). </p>
<p> In other words, avoid drinking a lot of fruit juice and enjoy whole fruits instead. </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> Eating whole fruit may help you consume fewer calories and lose weight over time. However, drinking fruit juice may have the opposite effect. </p>
<p> Eating Fruit May Lower Your Risk of Disease </p>
<p> Research consistently shows that diets high in fruits and vegetables are associated with a lower risk of many serious diseases including cancer, diabetes and heart disease (23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28). </p>
<p> While many studies look at fruit and vegetable consumption as a whole, there are a few studies that explore the benefits of fruits specifically. </p>
<p> One review of nine studies found that each additional serving of fruit eaten each day reduced the risk of heart disease by 7% (29). </p>
<p> Another study showed that eating fruits like grapes, apples and blueberries is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (22). </p>
<p> Citrus fruits, in particular, can raise the levels of citrate in your urine, which lowers the risk of kidney stones (30). </p>
<p> Increased fruit intake can also help lower blood pressure and reduce oxidative stress, which may decrease the risk of heart disease (31). </p>
<p> Eating more fruits and vegetables is also associated with improved blood sugar control in people with diabetes (32). </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> There are many studies indicating that fruit intake is associated with a lower risk of many serious diseases, including heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p> Is Fruit Safe for People With Diabetes? </p>
<p> Most dietary recommendations for people with diabetes suggest eating plenty of fruits and vegetables (33). </p>
<p> Current nutrition guidelines recommend that people with diabetes consume 2–4 servings of fruit per day, which is the same as the general population (34). </p>
<p> Still, some people restrict the amount they eat because they are worried about the sugar content. </p>
<p> However, studies show that when sugar is consumed in a whole fruit, it has very little effect on blood sugar levels (35). </p>
<p> What’s more, fruit is high in fiber, which actually slows the digestion and absorption of sugar, improving overall blood sugar control (36). </p>
<p> The fiber in fruit can also reduce insulin resistance and may help protect against type 2 diabetes (37, 38). </p>
<p> Fruits also contain polyphenols, which have been shown to improve blood sugar control (39, 40). </p>
<p> Furthermore, eating more fruits and vegetables has been linked with lower levels of oxidative stress and inflammation in people with diabetes (41). </p>
<p> That being said, not all fruits are created equal. Some of them raise blood sugar more than others, and diabetics are encouraged to monitor their blood sugar levels after eating to figure out which foods they should limit. </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> Fruit does contain sugar, but its fiber and polyphenols may actually improve long-term blood sugar control and protect against type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p> What About People Following a Low-Carb Diet? </p>
<p> Some people consider eating 100–150 grams of carbs per day to be “low-carb.” Others strive to get into nutritional ketosis and reduce carb intake to below 50 grams per day. This type of diet is called a ketogenic diet and goes beyond the standard low-carb diet. </p>
<p> The average piece of fruit contains anywhere from 15–30 grams of carbs, so the amount of you should eat depends entirely on how many grams of carbs you want to consume each day. </p>
<p> Needless to say, there isn’t a lot of room to include fruit on a ketogenic diet. </p>
<p> That’s not to say ketogenic diets are unhealthy. In fact, following a ketogenic diet can help you lose weight and can even help fight several diseases (42, 43, 44, 45). </p>
<p> Of all fruit, berries tend to be the lowest in carbs. So if you’re counting carbs, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries and strawberries are all excellent choices. </p>
<p> At the end of the day, fruits are very nutritious, but they don’t contain any essential nutrients that you can’t get from other foods, like vegetables. </p>
<p> If you choose to follow a ketogenic diet and greatly restrict your carb intake, it’s fine to avoid fruits as long as you are getting those nutrients from other foods. </p>
<p> For everyone else, fruit can and should be part of a healthy low-carb diet. </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> Fruit can be a healthy part of a low-carb diet. However, people who follow a very low-carb ketogenic diet may want to avoid fruit. </p>
<p> Is It Possible to Eat Too Much Fruit? </p>
<p> It’s been established that fruit is good for you, but can “too much” be harmful? First of all, when eating whole fruit, it’s rather difficult to eat too much. This is because fruits are very high in water and fiber, which makes them incredibly filling — to the point where you will likely feel full after just one piece. </p>
<p> Because of this, it is very difficult to eat large amounts of fruit every day. In fact, fewer than 1 in 10 Americans meet the minimum daily fruit recommendation (46). </p>
<p> Even though eating large amounts of fruit each day is very unlikely, a few studies have examined the effects of eating 20 servings each day. </p>
<p> In one study, 10 people ate 20 servings of fruit per day for two weeks and experienced no adverse effects (47). </p>
<p> In a slightly larger study, 17 people ate 20 servings of fruit per day for several months with no adverse effects (48). </p>
<p> In fact, researchers even found possible health benefits. Although these studies are small, they provide reason to believe that fruit is safe to eat in any amount. </p>
<p> At the end of the day, if you eat fruit until you feel full, it is almost impossible to eat “too much.” Nevertheless, it’s important to note that fruit should ideally be consumed as part of a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of other whole foods. </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> For the average person, fruit is safe in almost any amount. Unless you have an intolerance or are following a very low-carb or ketogenic diet, there really is no reason to limit your intake. </p>
<p> How Much Fruit Is Optimal? </p>
<p> Though it’s possible to eat healthy while eating very little or a lot of fruit, the ideal amount lies somewhere in the middle. </p>
<p> The general recommendation for fruit and vegetable intake is at least 400 grams per day, or five servings of 80 grams (49). </p>
<p> One 80-gram serving is equivalent to a small piece about the size of a tennis ball. For fruits and vegetables that can be measured by the cup, a serving is roughly 1 cup. </p>
<p> This recommendation stems from the fact that eating five servings of fruits and vegetables daily is associated with a lower risk of death from diseases like heart disease, stroke and cancer (50). </p>
<p> One large analysis of 16 scientific studies found that eating more than five servings per day provided no added benefit (50). </p>
<p> However, another systematic review of 95 scientific studies found the lowest disease risk at 800 grams, or 10 daily servings (51). </p>
<p> Keep in mind that these studies looked at both fruits and vegetables. Assuming half of these servings come from fruit, you should consume somewhere between two to five servings of fruit daily. </p>
<p> Recommendations from different health authorities vary slightly, but generally seem to align with the current research. </p>
<p> For example, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines recommend the average adult consume two servings of fruit per day, while the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends adults eat four to five servings of fruit per day. </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> Most studies show health benefits with two to five servings of fruit per day. However, there seems to be no harm in eating more than that. </p>
<p> The Bottom Line </p>
<p> Eating whole fruit promotes good health and can lower the risk of many serious diseases. </p>
<p> Unless you are following a ketogenic diet or have some sort of intolerance, there really is no reason to limit the amount of fruit you eat. </p>
<p> While most studies suggest that the optimal amount is two to five servings of fruit per day, there seems to be no harm in eating more. </p>

<p> How Soon After Taking Thyroid Medication Can I Eat? </p>
<p> Levothyroxine, also called T4 or thyroid hormone, is a commonly used thyroid medication. Brand names for this drug include Synthroid, Levothroid, Levoxyl, Tirosint and Unithroid 1. Doctors prescribe levothyroxine for any patient who is hypothyroid, either because his thyroid does not produce enough thyroid hormone naturally, or because disease or cancer has necessitated surgical removal of the thyroid. This medication is usually required for life. Your doctor will most likely recommend that you take levothyroxine first thing in the morning and that you wait for a specified period of time, usually 30 to 60 minutes, before eating or drinking anything other than water. A person taking levothyroxine should follow the same daily medication regimen to ensure a steady level of thyroid hormone in the body. </p>
<p> Levothyroxine and Water </p>
<p> Levothyroxine should be swallowed as a single dose and with a full 8-oz. glass of water. Because the pill dissolves quickly, if taken dry it could swell in your throat and cause gagging or choking. Although you should not take this drug with a beverage such as juice or coffee, you can drink as much water as you like after swallowing the pill. </p>

<p> Because the pill dissolves quickly, if taken dry it could swell in your throat and cause gagging or choking. </p>
<p> Levothyroxine and Food </p>
<p> Physicians generally direct patients to take levothyroxine immediately upon awakening. Prescription directions recommend that you take this drug on an empty stomach, along with a full glass of water, and that you wait at least 30 to 60 minutes before eating or drinking anything other than water. Taking levothyroxine on an empty stomach increases the absorption of the medication. </p>
<p> Foods or Medications That Can Affect Levothyroxine </p>
<p> Certain foods may cause your body to absorb less of this medication, according to the MayoClinic.com website. These include high-fiber foods: walnuts, cotton seed meal and soybean flour. Speak to your doctor if any of these foods are a regular part of your diet. Some medications or vitamins can also make thyroid medication less effective, including antacids, cholesterol-lowering drugs and calcium and iron supplements. These should be taken either four hours before or after taking levothyroxine. </p>

<p> Recommended Dosing </p>
<p> As a general rule, you should take your thyroid medication at the same time each day, then wait for the recommended amount of time before eating. However, if you forget to take your daily dosage in the morning or at your usual time, you should take the missed dose as soon as you remember, regardless of when or what you have eaten. If it is almost time to take your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose. Do not take an extra dose unless specifically directed to do so by your doctor. </p>

<p> How to Eat Fish Heads </p>
<p> Fish heads can be the tastiest bites of the fish—and they figure prominently in many cuisines. They’re flavorful, for one thing—often more flavorful than the rest of the fish, says hillsbilly. But it’s not just a flavor thing; fish heads also offer up textural interest, from the gelatinous bits to the delicate cheek meat to the slightly crunchy eyeballs. How do you eat them? Same way you eat ribs, says ipsedixit—”Just dig in. Bibs optional.” Just eat little bits at a time, advises hillsbilly, and discard the bits of skull. </p>
<p> ozinboz follows this method: “Starting from the jaw, I pry off each bone that I can reach. When I find a bit of flesh that looks appetizing, I suck it off the bone. Anything that looks too gelatinous for my preference, I pile along with the rest of the discarded bones.” </p>
<p> And don’t be afraid of fish eyes, while you’re at it. “The eyes of a fried fish are considered prime parts in some cultures,” says JungMann. “I spent years patiently satisfying my hunger on fatty, soft cheeks or the rich flesh on the foreheads of the fish whilst I awaited the honor of chowing down on the crunchy, nutty bits that normally went to my grandparents and sundry dignitaries.” </p>
<p> “At home I dust salmon fish heads in corn flour and quickly deep-fry, then set aside while I make a sauce. I like sweet and vinegary,” says hillsbilly. “My son is 7; this is our treat we eat together. Husband and other kids aren’t interested. We like it like that.” </p>

<p> How to Eat Food in Minecraft </p>
<p> This Minecraft tutorial explains how to eat food with screenshots and step-by-step instructions. </p>
<p> In Survival mode, food will replenish your health. It is not necessary to eat food in Creative mode, since you have unlimited resources. Let's explore how to eat food. </p>
<p> Edible Items </p>
<p> These are some of the foods that you can eat in Minecraft: </p>
<p> TIP: When you eat food, it will replenish your food bar or health bar, depending on your version of Minecraft. Some foods give you status effects that are positive, while other foods can cause you harmful effects. </p>
<p> WARNING: So, be careful what you eat! </p>
<p> How to Eat Food </p>
<p> Quite often, you will find yourself low on health and you need to replenish your health by eating food. </p>
<p> In this example, we will demonstrate how to eat food by eating a bowl of rabbit stew. </p>
<p> We have added rabbit stew to our inventory and selected it in our hotbar. If you don't have food in your inventory, you can quickly make some with a crafting recipe for food. </p>
<p> The game control to eat food depends on the version of Minecraft: </p>
<p> For Java Edition (PC/Mac), right click and hold. </p>
<p> For Pocket Edition (PE), you tap and hold. </p>
<p> For Xbox 360 and Xbox One, press and hold the LT button on the Xbox controller. </p>
<p> For PS3 and PS4, press and hold the L2 button on the PS controller. </p>
<p> For Wii U, press and hold the ZL button on the gamepad. </p>
<p> For Nintendo Switch, press and hold the ZL button on the controller. </p>
<p> For Windows 10 Edition, right click and hold. </p>
<p> For Education Edition, right click and hold. </p>
<p> You should now see yourself eating. Since we are eating rabbit stew, we will see an empty bowl left in our hotbar when we are done eating. </p>
<p> Now that you have consumed the food, you should see your food bar increase and then your health bar will increase slowly, one point at a time. Or if you don't have a food bar, you will just see your hearts restored. </p>
<p> How to Eat Cake </p>
<p> Although cake is a food that is eaten to replenish your health, it's consumed a bit differently than other foods in Minecraft. A cake is eaten one slice at a time until it's all gone. Let's look at an example of how to eat a cake in the game. </p>
<p> In this example, we have added a cake to our inventory and selected it in our hotbar. </p>
<p> Now the first thing you need to do is put the cake down on the ground. This must be done before you can eat any of the cake. </p>
<p> The game control to place the cake down depends on the version of Minecraft: </p>
<p> For Java Edition (PC/Mac), right click on the block. </p>
<p> For Pocket Edition (PE), you tap on the block. </p>
<p> For Xbox 360 and Xbox One, press the LT button on the Xbox controller. </p>
<p> For PS3 and PS4, press the L2 button on the PS controller. </p>
<p> For Wii U, press the ZL button on the gamepad. </p>
<p> For Nintendo Switch, press the ZL button on the controller. </p>
<p> For Windows 10 Edition, right click on the block. </p>
<p> For Education Edition, right click on the block. </p>
<p> Now that the cake has been set down, you can eat a slice of cake at a time to replenish your health. The game control to eat a slice of cake depends on the version of Minecraft: </p>
<p> For Java Edition (PC/Mac), right click on the cake. </p>
<p> For Pocket Edition (PE), you tap on the cake. </p>
<p> For Xbox 360 and Xbox One, press the LT button on the Xbox controller. </p>
<p> For PS3 and PS4, press the L2 button on the PS controller. </p>
<p> For Nintendo Switch, press the ZL button on the controller. </p>
<p> For Windows 10 Edition, right click on the cake. </p>
<p> For Education Edition, right click on the cake. </p>
<p> You should now see a slice of the cake disappear. </p>
<p> Now that you have eaten a piece of cake, you should see your food bar increase and then your health bar will increase slowly, one point at a time. Or if you don't have a food bar, you will just see hearts restored. </p>
<p> Congratulations, you just learned how to eat food (including cake) in Minecraft. </p>

<p> How to Eat in Stardew Valley: All you need to know! </p>
<p> Welcome to our post on how to eat in Stardew Valley! </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> Why we like Stardey Valley that much! </p>
<p> Stardew Valley is one the most popular indie games on the market today – and for good reason. Its blend of exploration and trial-and-error gameplay is an extremely addictive homage to Harvest Moon while still innovating on nearly every core mechanic of its inspiration. </p>
<p> For those unfamiliar with the game’s premise, you play as an office worker (you can customize the appearance and gender of your character when you start the game) who inherits a farm from your grandfather. Your job is to clear the land before improving it by growing crops, building buildings, and generally improving the farm in line with certain quests and objectives. Ultimately. Though. how you play and what you prioritize is entirely up to you; it’s impossible to actually “lose” in Stardew Valley. </p>
<p> One of the most appealing aspects of the game is the ability to learn and figure things out for yourself as you go. The game features no tutorial aside from a few quests designed to introduce you to the core mechanics. Therefore, players are expected to experiment for themselves and see what works. This is a gameplay style that should be familiar to any fans of games like Minecraft or Terraria. However, that doesn’t mean that new players will want to have to figure out every single mechanic on their own. </p>
<p> Food And Energy In Stardew Valley </p>
<p> For a game all about farming, it isn’t surprising that food plays a key role in success in Stardew Valley. While your character doesn’t technically need to eat (there is no Hunger meter, you will not starve to death) you will need to eat to keep your energy levels up. Keeping an eye on your character’s energy is vital to maximizing your actions, during the limited daylight hours of a day in Stardew Valley. </p>
<p> What Is Energy? </p>
<p> In the bottom-right corner of the screen, there is a green meter with an “E” at the top. This represents your current energy level. Fishing and using tools consume Energy – weapons do not. At the beginning of the game, the player has a maximum energy of 270; however, eating special items called “Stardrops” can permanently increase this. </p>
<p> If your energy drops to zero, you will become “exhausted”. This is shown by an “X” above the energy meter, as well as a pop-up saying “You fell sluggish from over-exertion.” When exhausted, you will be unable to use fishing poles and your movement speed will be greatly slowed. You will still be able to use energy-draining tools, however, your energy will dip into the negatives. </p>
<p> If your energy reaches minus 15, you will pass out on the spot; if this is outside of your house, you will lose 10% of your current money (up to a maximum of 1,000). Should you raise your energy back above zero, you will regain your lost movement speed. However, you will still be exhausted which will result in restoring 50% less energy when you sleep that night. </p>
<p> How Do I Restore Energy? </p>
<p> There are two main ways to restore your energy in Stardew Valley – sleeping and eating: </p>
<p> Sleeping is performed by simply walking up to your bed and selecting “Yes” when asked if you would like to sleep. The time that you go to sleep affects how much energy you recover; for best results, get to bed no later than 12:00 AM. </p>
<p> However, you will likely find yourself running low on energy during the day, with no time to take a nap. To quickly restore your energy – or even increase it temporarily – it is necessary to eat food. </p>
<p> How Do I Eat In Stardew Valley? </p>
<p> Before choosing to eat any food, you should first consider whether it is a “positive energy” or a “negative energy” food. Most foods available to you restore lost energy (a fried egg restores 50 energy, for example). However, certain foods such as Sap or Void Mayonaise will cause the player to lose energy. </p>
<p> Now, how to eat in Stardew Valley? To eat, simply open your inventory by pressing either ESC or “E’ and make sure that the food you want to eat is in your hotbar. To do this, place the food in one of the first 10 slots in your inventory. </p>
<p> Once you have the food in your hotbar, you need to hold it. Do this by selecting it in your hotbar, you will see the food item appear above your head. Next, simply right-click on any blank part of the screen and select “yes” when asked if you want to eat it. You should see your energy refill immediately. </p>

<p> Wondering how to get a picky toddler to eat meat? Read my tips for how we got our toddler to eat meat and overcome texture aversion with meat! </p>
<p> Concern about protein </p>
<p> If you have a picky eater who doesn't like meat, you might be worried about whether they're getting enough protein. This is a very valid concern among parents of picky eaters, and it's probably the second most common concern I hear after the usual "my toddler doesn't like vegetables." </p>
<p> The good news is, your toddler doesn't actually need all that much protein. I wrote a whole article about how much protein a toddler needs - broken down by age from 1-5, and with lots of suggestions for how to meet that number daily. </p>
<p> And while it is very easy to meet the daily protein needs with non-meat sources, such as yogurt, lentils, nuts and nut butters, and other sources of protein, wouldn't it be nice if we were able to cook one meal for the whole family and have everyone eat chicken for dinner if that's what on the menu? </p>
<p> I, for one, was very tired cooking separate foods for my son back when he was a super picky eater. </p>
<p> And it would be nice not to have to count up grams of protein and worry about your child's protein intake daily. Meat has a lot more protein than most of the other sources of protein, so if your child eats a nice serving of meat per day you can pretty much guarantee that they are getting enough protein for the day. </p>
<p> So let's get in to how to get a toddler to eat meat (and like it)! </p>
<p> Pickiness about meat or texture aversion? </p>
<p> A lot of toddlers don't like the texture of meat. It's not about the flavor, but about how it feels in their mouth when they first put it into their mouth, and when they chew it. Meat doesn't dissolve as well in the mouth - unlike lots of carbs - so at some point you have to just swallow it, which can be a weird feeling to get over. </p>
<p> This was definitely the case for our son, and once I figured that out, I knew how to approach getting our toddler to eat meat. I realized I was starting with the wrong meats for my son and had to start with easier textures. </p>
<p> Before I get into any more tips, I want to give the necessary disclosure: only give your toddler meat if they already know how to chew other foods pretty well. Give them small bites appropriate for their age and small servings appropriate for their age. Discuss this with a pediatrician or a feeding expert if you are not sure. And of course, talk to your pediatrician about testing for food allergies before introducing any new foods. </p>
<p> Meat 101 - starting with the right meat for picky eaters </p>
<p> A lot of parents start with either chicken nuggets or steamed chicken breast as one of the first meats, with the logic being that "toddlers love chicken nuggets!" or "chicken breast is so healthy." Unfortunately, chicken breast can be bland and tough and hard to chew even if it is prepared really well. And chicken nuggets have that breaded texture and an odd chewiness that many toddlers love.... but many have a hard time with. </p>
<p> Every kid is different. </p>
<p> I know my son had a really hard time liking the breaded texture on chicken nuggets and refused them for a long time. Below you will find meats that my picky toddler learned to accept first, but of course you might have a different experience. </p>
<p> Start with one of these meats as a "first meat," then continue to build off that if it goes well. If not, then try again in a couple of weeks, or think of a different way to present this food. </p>
<p> The good thing is you don't have to try just one at a time. You can offer your toddler several of these over the course of a week and see which one they are more likely to eat. </p>
<p> 1. Thinly sliced deli turkey or ham </p>
<p> Try honey ham if your child has more of a sweet tooth. The very thin texture of deli meat is a lot easier to get used to than if you are starting with other meats. Try to get nitrite/nitrate free deli meat. You can try giving your child a small piece of a thin slice, dice it up finely into other foods they like, wrap it up with a slice of cheese, or put it on a piece of bread if your child eats bread. </p>
<p> We started with just the thin sliced turkey and this was our son's main source of protein for months. We gradually increased to thicker slices, until he was willing to eat and chew cubed ham. From then on, a whole world of "other meat" opened up suddenly, and he was willing to try lots of different textures, such as the ones below. </p>
<p> 2. BBQ pulled chicken </p>
<p> This BBQ Pulled Chicken recipe made in the Instant Pot was the first "real" meat my son ate and loved. The BBQ sauce is totally kid friendly, and the Instant Pot makes chicken so tender that it doesn't feel like chewing meat. </p>
<p> We had to cut the pulled chicken strands into even smaller pieces for my son so he didn't have to chew too much, and this was key to getting him to eat it. </p>
<p> Once he was eating this, we made chicken thighs with BBQ sauce so he recognized the familiar flavor that he likes. The meat from chicken thighs is a lot softer than the white chicken meat and is a lot easier to chew. To this day, my son LOVES dark meat on chicken because it's so easy to chew and will eat a ton of it... but will give up after just a few bites of chicken breast. </p>
<p> 3. Canned chicken </p>
<p> Canned chicken is also a good option for toddlers who have a bit of a texture aversion when it comes to meat. It is usually soft, broken up into little bits, and lightly seasoned. It might need a bit of mayo or a dash of lemon juice to liven it up, but it is pretty easy to chew. </p>
<p> If your child likes crackers, having them dip the cracker into canned chicken meat is a good introduction to the canned chicken - they will not get any substantial chicken onto their cracker but they will get a taste for it, so they know what to expect if they actually scoop some up next time. </p>
<p> Try this 3-ingredient chicken salad recipe - get your toddler involved in helping to make it and they might be more willing to give it a try! (Just use non-spicy salsa if you are not sure how your child would like a little bit of spice.. though you really can't taste it!) </p>
<p> 4. Fish - canned or fresh </p>
<p> OK OK, fish is not what we consider a meat, and even many adults are super picky about fish, but hear me out. </p>
<p> Fish has a much softer texture than most meats and is a lot easier to chew. And while many toddlers are picky, many also love fish. My picky son LOVED tuna and salmon before he liked pancakes, bread, cheese, or cake. </p>
<p> Canned tuna is a super easy "meat" to try. This 3-ingredient tuna salad is the same as my easy chicken salad but made with tuna instead, and I always have my son help me make it. </p>
<p> Fresh fish is also very easy to chew (just don't overcook it), and might be a good option for toddlers who are not eating meat yet. Any light, flaky fish would be great. We love swai in our family (here are a few of my favorite swai recipes), but you can try tilapia or salmon as a good "first fish" too. </p>
<p> 5. Bolognese or meatballs </p>
<p> Ground meat might be easier for little kids to chew, so adding ground beef to Bolognese sauce or making little meatballs might be a great way to get some toddlers to eat meat. If they already like saucy pasta then it's a no-brainer to try adding a few pieces of cooked ground meat into their pasta sauce and see if they will eat it like that. You know your kid best as to whether you need to hide those pieces of meat at first, or if your child would take a bite after they see that it's so small and they have so much delicious pasta and sauce on their fork in addition to the meat... </p>
<p> If that works, you can transition to bigger crumbles of meat in sauce and work your way up to meatballs. </p>
<p> The great thing about meatballs is that you can also hide lots of vegetables in them, so your child can be eating a very healthy meal if they eat pasta with meatballs (especially if you have some tomato sauce on there for extra veggies). </p>
<p> So what do you think? Would your child try any of these? Or have you tried them all and it's just not working? Let me know in the comments below! That's the only way I will know whether this is helpful or if you need me to help you brainstorm a few more ideas. </p>

<p> Human Food that Cats Can Eat </p>
<p> Fighting the temptation to give your cat leftovers straight from your plate? We understand what it’s like, you want to reward your cat but you are never sure if it is safe to give human food cats can eat. </p>
<p> When it comes down to people’s food that cats can eat, you need to be cautious! Cats are obligate carnivores. Eating something out of the ordinary could be toxic for them. </p>
<p> Here is a list of common safe and toxic foods that will give you the basic knowledge of which types of human food that cats can eat. Just know that the foods below should never be fed as a regular diet (except for meat) for your cat! </p>
<p> Article last updated: [last-modified] </p>
<p> Let’s start with our amazing infographic about human food that cats can eat. </p>
<p> 15 Human Foods Cats Can Eat & Cannot Eat </p>
<p> Cats can eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, and meat, and fish, such as: </p>
<p> Chicken, turkey, beef, steak, and liver, hearts, and other meat </p>
<p> Apples, bananas, canteloupe, blueberries </p>
<p> Sweet potato, cooked carrots, asparagus, zucchini </p>
<p> Eggs, fish filets, tuna, sardines, salmon </p>
<p> In order to reduce food-borne illnesses, always cook eggs, veggies, meat, and fish although some cat owners prefer feeding a raw food diet. </p>
<p> Grapes </p>
<p> Can cats eat fruits? YES but… </p>
<p> Certain fruits are totally fine for cats to eat, but be careful. Fruits with seeds (apples, apricots, pears, grapes, cherry) can be extremely dangerous for your cat. </p>
<p> The seeds of these fruits contain a harmful substance: cyanogenic glycoside. </p>
<p> If you are not sure, just don’t feed your cat with it or ask your vet beforehand. </p>
<p> To help you out, here are 2 healthy fruit alternatives cats can eat. Cantaloupe (antioxidants and beta-carotene which promotes healthy skin and eye health), and blueberries (an excellent source of vitamins A and C). </p>
<p> Can cats eat bananas? YES </p>
<p> Yes! Bananas make up for a great human snack for your cat. They are a great source of potassium and soluble fiber. It’s a good and healthy little snack for fluffy as long as you do not overfeed him with it! </p>
<p> Can cats eat apples? YES but… </p>
<p> Yes, cats can eat apples as they are a rich source of fiber and vitamin C. But it is important to take off the skin and the seeds. As mentioned earlier, seeds are toxic for cats! </p>
<p> Can cats eat grapes? NO </p>
<p> Cats should avoid eating grapes because they are sometimes hidden with seeds. Remember, no seeds! 🙂 They contain a harmful substance for your cat. It’s better not to take the risk and avoid poisoning your cat, don’t you think? </p>
<p> Can cats eat vegetables? YES, but… </p>
<p> Yes, cats can eat vegetables but only little amounts. Also, it’s important to cook them! We recommend avoiding uncooked veggies that your cat could potentially have a hard time to digest. </p>
<p> Recommended cooked vegetables for your cat’s consumption are asparagus, zucchini, and sweet potato as they aid in maintaining a healthy digestive system. Other good vegetables for your cats are baked carrots, steamed broccoli, green beans, winter squash, or chopped greens. </p>
<p> Can cats eat onions or garlic? NO </p>
<p> Onions and garlic are two human foods for cats to be avoided at all costs. </p>
<p> Those two contain sulfur compounds that are harmful to cats. Your cat could throw up, have anemia and tachycardia. It’s best to avoid it! </p>
<p> A good rule of thumb is to never feed your cat with people food that contains onions or garlic. Even if a little amount won’t kill him, it’s better to be safe than sorry. </p>
<p> Can cats eat avocados? NO </p>
<p> Avocados are not great human foods for cats to eat because they contain a toxin called Persin, which is dangerous for your furry friend. According to the ASPCA, avocado is mostly dangerous for cattle, horses, goats, and birds. </p>
<p> However, even if it is not clearly established if it is highly dangerous for cats, we recommend not to take the risk and choose another type of human food that cats can eat. </p>
<p> Can cats eat corn? YES, but… </p>
<p> Yes, cats can eat corn just fine, but it’s not the best for them. Most cheap cat food brands have corn or corn meal as the first ingredient. It’s not gonna harm your cat but we find nothing that indicates it is beneficial for your cat. </p>
<p> In fact, such ingredients in cheap cat food can actually end up harming your cat’s health over the long run. </p>
<p> A little bit of it, why not, but we don’t think it’s the best! </p>
<p> Can cats eat meat? YES!!!! </p>
<p> Not only they can, but they should! </p>
<p> Cats are obligate carnivores, which means they cannot survive without meat. </p>
<p> It’s one of the safest human foods a cat can have! </p>
<p> The best is poultry (we recommend cooking plain chicken for its lean protein), but you can feed your cat turkey or any other kind of meat, too. </p>
<p> Just make sure the meat has not been salted as cats should not consume salt or any other spices. </p>
<p> Can cats eat fish? YES, but… </p>
<p> Cats love fish so you won’t have to force them to eat it. However, it’s important to carefully choose what type of fish you feed him: it’s better to choose a “fat” type of fish like tuna, salmon, or mackerel because it contains a fatty acid that your cat cannot produce by himself (fish oil/omega 3). </p>
<p> Too much fish is a bad thing for your cat and would cause some trouble if you don’t be careful! They can eat raw fish but it’s always better to cook it! </p>
<p> We recommend salmon for its omega 3. </p>
<p> Be careful with canned tuna: they often contain too much salt and it will damage your cat’s kidneys in the long run. </p>
<p> Can cats eat eggs? YES </p>
<p> Eggs are safe for cats to eat and is a recommended treat! Eggs provide a nutritious amount of proteins. </p>
<p> Many books recommend eggs for your cat and some say it’s ok to give it raw but we believe it is too risky and that it needs to be cooked to prevent diseases such as salmonella or E. Colli. </p>
<p> Next time you run out of kitty treats, turn to the fridge and scramble up an egg! Bon appétit! </p>
<p> Can cats drink milk? YES, but… </p>
<p> Great question. Everybody usually thinks that it’s okay to give milk to a cat since they drink their mom’s milk as kittens. </p>
<p> As they become adults, however, most cats become lactose intolerant! </p>
<p> Giving them a bowl of milk might not be the best snack for the beast. </p>
<p> Yoda always can smell when there is a glass of milk out. We cannot resist giving him a lick or two from our fingers but don’t put out a bowl for your cat to lap up. This isn’t Hollywood! </p>
<p> And no, it is not okay to give milk instead of their regular food or water. </p>
<p> Can cats eat cheese? YES, but… </p>
<p> Cats don’t really digest dairy very well, so if they are lactose intolerant it’s not wise to give them cheese. Especially when there are so many other human foods you can give your cat! </p>
<p> If your cat is crazy for cheese though, it is technically safe but in small amounts only. The best choices of cheese are Cheddar, Swiss or Gouda (hard cheese type), as they are rich in calcium and protein. </p>
<p> And lastly… </p>
<p> Can cats eat chocolate? NO </p>
<p> Chocolate is dangerous for your cat (the same goes for dogs). As good as it tastes in our human mouths, chocolate contains theobromine which disturbs a cat’s nervous system. </p>
<p> Plus, they cannot eliminate this substance without suffering so avoid giving chocolate to your cat at all costs. </p>
<p> Make sure to wrap up your candy bar and store it away. In a nutshell, too much chocolate could be fatal. </p>
<p> My cat ate something he should not have, what do I do? </p>
<p> If your cat ate human food he or she shouldn’t have, then contact your vet immediately. The faster you are, the best chances you have! </p>
<p> Remember, cats are obligate carnivores so if you ever want to give human food to your cat, the best is to just whip up some plain cooked chicken! </p>
<p> There are plenty of human foods cats can eat safely, but it’s wise to limit giving your cat any table scraps. </p>
<p> If you want to treat your cat with human food, do so sparingly and caringly! </p>
<p> Final Thoughts: Human Food that Cats Can & Cannot Eat </p>
<p> Feeding human food to your cat is not bad at all! Just make sure the people food your providing isn’t toxic or dangerous to your cat’s health. </p>
<p> The good thing is that the list of dangerous food for cats is actually pretty small. </p>
<p> An easy rule of thumb to keep in mind is to feed your cat only up to 15% of human foods. </p>
<p> Here are some reminders when giving your cat human food: </p>
<p> Do everything in moderation </p>
<p> Be careful with potential allergies </p>
<p> Think twice before giving your cat food </p>
<p> Avoid producing bad behavior (i.e., jumping up on the table during dinner..) </p>

<p> 16 Comments </p>
<p> Thank you for useful list. It was mentioned fish but what about seafood? Could cats eat squid and shrimps? </p>
<p> Thanks for sharing the information. I think everyone has a pet, but they do not know what type of food is nutritious for your cat. So this article is very informative for all those who have cats in the form of ESA … </p>
<p> Cats do not have to be fed cooked meat, it should be raw. That is their natural diet, and they have very acidic stomachs that are able to digest raw meats/eggs without causing harm to the animal. Raw meats should be included in their diet regularly as much as possible. The processed kibble most animal owners feed is terrible for cats. Cats would not be obese or have a ton of food allergies if they were simply fed what nature intended. </p>
<p> Hi there! Yes we agree, cats are carnivores and yep, that means meat – raw or cooked – but let’s face it, most house cats aren’t used to eating raw meat. Our Yoda wouldn’t dig his teeth into raw meat like a feral cat would simply because he’s a spoiled house cat who likes to play with mice rather than eat them. And this article is meant to inform cat owners what human foods are safe for their cats to eat, not as daily substitutes, but on the rare case there’s no more kibble. We definitely agree with the processed kibble statement, and that’s why we recommend not to buy into the cheap stuff (because it’s truly unnatural for cats). However, there are some quality brand cat foods, like Orijen, but they come at a price not many cat owners can afford. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
<p> I was feeding the stray cats in my neighborhood, poor things were so hungry and it made me feel good knowing they had a full belly. I got a letter from the home owners association, that if I didn’t stop feeding them I would be fined and legal action would take place. I feel so bad it breaks my heart knowing they are hungry. Don’t know what to do now. Why do people have to be so hateful? I try to sneak a little dry food when it gets dark and everyone should be inside. Nosey ass neighbors. </p>
<p> Oh my goodness! That’s very upsetting. Thanks so much for feeding the kitties! How many are there? Maybe you could just tell them that technically they are yours since you are the main caretaker? It’s likely they will still come around to your house, because that’s where they know they can go for food and cuddles. I bet you already have, but I can’t help to ask anyway: adoption?? =^^= Otherwise if you can’t have cats in your house, you could make a little outdoor “home” for them using a storage box with a little hole cut out. You could put in an old blanket and bowls for food and water. They wouldn’t necessarily be strays then 🙂 We wish you best of luck, please keep us updated if you decide to home them or take some to a shelter. Thanks again for your message! </p>
<p> Report them to the cruelty of animals. One man just got 90 yeArs in prison. Also, there are cat organizations that can capture them and relocate them or maybe find them a home. I would relocate them because someone might harm them, </p>
<p> Honestly, I didn’t know that cats could eat eggs! I think it’s amazing cats are able to eat what humans can eat, thank you for this informative article, Fluffy Kitty! </p>
<p> Aww, super glad the article was of some use for you! Many thanks for dropping by and stay tuned with more pawticles! </p>
<p> Every day I go into my backyard and there is always a little cat. It seems to be scared of humans. It looked very skinny so i put some baloney and water out. My parents said to leave the cat alone and not to feed it. About 10 minutes after i put the water and baloney out i looked up what is good for cats. It said that Boloney is not very good for cats. I went outside and replaced the baloney with a banana. The internet said that bananas r good for cats. I wanted to name the cat kitty. </p>
<p> Hi Briana, indeed – not all human foods are safe for cats. Bananas are a good choice, though. Thanks for dropping by. 🙂 </p>

<p> Enjoy my food when I eat it but then with in 5 to 10 mins It just comes back up I still don't no what it is but its orful I really feel for you. I have also lost weight I </p>
<p> Have lost 2 and half. Stone I was lossin about 4 pound per week. </p>
<p> could be that u are either a balimic or b anorexic i know i was for a very long time and i do have a habbit of going back into that state </p>
<p> My mom had the same problem. I asked her and asked her to go see a doctor for about 2 years. Finally she did and found out that she had stomach cancer. She passed away 3 weeks later. The doctor told us if we had acted a few years sooner she may have had a chance. I suggest going and getting a upper GI. </p>
<p> I suffer from anorexia and that is not a sign you just stop eating. Balimic is where you gorge yourself and force yourself to puke and take laxatives. I have been having troubles with being able to keep food down or be able to eat without diarrhea. After eating and getting sick it lasts for hours and I get real lathargic as well. It makes life difficult cause I have to stop everything after I eat. I know it isn't me eating a lot or really fast. I have always been a slow eater and I eat about the amount you would give a 1yr old. The last major incident was when I had a veggie burger and I almost ended up in the er. </p>
<p> Why everytime I eat I feel sick,I took a pregnancy test and it was negative,but from I have sex last 2 weeks I feel sick none can u please help me. </p>
<p> You may be lacking in digestive enzymes. There is not an unlimited supply and people can run out. Try taking a quality digestive enzyme pill. This is a must....look up food combining. Basically, not eating protein and carbs together. No meat and bread. No sandwiches. No spaghetti and meat balls. No eggs and toast. No meat and potatoes. </p>

<p> I have been getting sick every time after I eat. And my back starts to hurt really bad. I've had my gallbladder out about three years ago. I'm not pregnant had my tubes tide. I don't know what to do.. </p>
<p> no offence, pregnancy tests aren't always accurate. I was parget for a month and a half and it came back negative till I was 2 and a half months along. it they did it with all 3 of my kids, but the worst was the first it wasn't until I was 3 months along. and I went to the dr. plus my sis was parget for 6 months hers kept coming back negative, until the ds visit. ps she was pragnet with twins. </p>
<p> I dislike this person's answer, no matter how right, strictly because they put 'b4'. This may be the only case I will ever come across where I agree with someone who type lik dis... And I'm not happy about it. Is there a mental health section on this site? I need to evaluate something... </p>

<p> Malathion is a toxic pesticide used to control aphids, spider mites and a wide range of insects that chew and suck on plants. It interferes with the nervous systems of insects, suppresses their ability to breathe properly and is toxic to humans who come into contact with it, inhale it or consume it. The recommended period for consuming fruits after applying malathion is based on correct application methods and rates that vary for different fruits and are printed on the manufacturer's label. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Toxic Qualities </p>
<p> Although the body typically gets rid of malathion quickly, exposed persons have experienced headaches, vomiting, cramps, abdominal pain, muscle weakness, tremors, slowed heartbeat, shortness of breath and diarrhea. People who apply it may experience symptoms if they do not wear masks, goggles and protective clothing. If you inhale malathion or come into contact with it, wash the area for 15 minutes, discard contaminated clothing and contact the National Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. Fruit treated with malathion should not be harvested until the manufacturer's suggested waiting period has passed and its harmful potential has dissipated. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One-Day Wait </p>
<p> Wait one day before harvesting fruit after you apply malathion on blackberries (Rubus fruticosis), logenberries (Rubus × loganobaccus) and boysenberries (Rubus ursinus × idaeus), all grown in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 5 through 10, depending on the species and cultivar. A one-day wait is required for raspberries (Rubus idaeus, USDA zones 2 through 7), blueberries in the genus Cyanococcus, (USDA zones 3 through 7), pears in the genus Pyrus (USDA zones 3 through 10) and apples (Malus domestica, USDA zones 3 through 8). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Three-Day Wait </p>
<p> Wait three days before harvesting fruit after you apply malathion on cherries in the Prunus genus, USDA zones 4 through 7, and citrus fruit in the Citrus genus, USDA zones 8 through 10, including grapefruit (Citrus × paradise), lemons (Citrus × limon), limes (Citrus x latifolia), oranges (Citrus × sinensis), tangerines (Citrus tangerine) and kumquats (Citrus japonica). </p>
<p> Seven-Day Wait </p>
<p> Wait seven days before harvesting fruit after you apply malathion on apricots (Prunus armeniaca), USDA zones 4 through 9, and peaches (Prunus persica), USDA zones 5 through 8. </p>

<p> Of all the fad diets of the moment, intermittent fasting has garnered much attention for its convincing evidence in scientific literature. Throughout history, fasting has been utilized as an expression of political dissent, desire for spiritual reward, as well as a therapeutic tool. And it's recently gained widespread traction among fitness gurus for its touted weight loss and anti-aging effects. But that brings the big question: Is there an ultimate intermittent fasting guide so you know what to eat while you're on this diet? </p>
<p> First, let's take a step back and break down the basics: How does the diet work when it comes to these major intermittent fasting health benefits? Scientists postulate that the anti-aging benefits are largely due to increased insulin sensitivity, and weight loss is related to an overall reduced calorie intake because of a shortened feeding window. Simply put, when you have less time during the day to eat, you eat less. Easy, right? But a key concept, as with any diet, is determining feasibility for your lifestyle. </p>
<p> One study published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology showed diet-induced weight loss typically leads to a 70 percent regain in weight, so finding any type of weight-loss plan that works best for you and won't cause you any damage in the future is the key. </p>
<p> There are many different methods one could follow with intermittent fasting, but Andres Ayesta, MS, RDN, registered dietitian and expert in the field of fasting, says that the time-restricted feeding (TRF) approach is the best option for working adults. </p>
<p> "Fasting from 9 p.m. until about 1 p.m. the next day works well because most people are already skipping breakfast or are eating poor ones," Ayesta says. This approach can work well around a day job, but Ayesta also emphasizes the importance of maintaining dietary needs around this time-restricted feeding window. This means that overall diet quality and habitual food choices still matter while intermittent fasting and that you probably won't get the body of your dreams while chowing down on nothing but hamburgers and fries. In fact, eating junk food in a condensed feeding window on the IF diet may actually put you at risk of a shortfall of key nutrients such as calcium, iron, protein, and fiber, all of which are essential for normal biological function. Plus, consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables allows for more antioxidants in your body, which, like the metabolic effects of intermittent fasting, may contribute to a longer lifespan. </p>
<p> Alternate Day Fasting (ADF)—1 day ad libitum eating (normal eating) alternated with 1 day of complete fasting </p>
<p> Modified Alternate Day Fasting (mADF)—1 day ad libitum feeding alternated with 1 day very low-calorie diet (about 25 percent of normal caloric intake) </p>
<p> 2/5—Complete fasting on 2 days of the week with 5 days ad libitum eating </p>
<p> 1/6—Complete fasting on 1 day of the week with 6 days ad libitum eating </p>
<p> Time Restricting Feeding (TRF)—Fasting for 12-20 hours per day (as a prolongation of the nighttime fast) on each day of the week. "Feeding window" of 4-12 hours </p>
<p> OK, so you have the time windows for when you can chow down, but you're probably wondering what to eat during your IF journey. We rounded up 20 of the best foods to create the ultimate intermittent fasting food guide that will help prevent nutrient shortfalls. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Water </p>
<p> One of the most important aspects of maintaining a healthy eating pattern while intermittent fasting is to promote hydration. As we go without fuel for 12 to 16 hours, our body's preferred energy source is the sugar stored in the liver, also known as glycogen. As this energy is burned, so disappears a large volume of fluid and electrolytes. Drinking at least eight cups of water per day will prevent dehydration and also promote better blood flow, cognition, and muscle and joint support during your intermittent fasting regimen. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Coffee </p>
<p> What about a warm cup of Joe? Will a daily Starbucks run break the fast? It's a common question among newbie intermittent fasters. But worry not: Coffee is allowed. Because in its natural state coffee is a calorie-free beverage, it can even technically be consumed outside a designated feeding window. But the minute syrups, creamers, or candied flavorings are added, it can no longer be consumed during the time of the fast, so that's something to keep in mind if you usually doctor up your drink. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Minimally-Processed Grains </p>
<p> Carbohydrates are an essential part of life and are most definitely not the enemy when it comes to weight loss. Because a large chunk of your day will be spent fasting during this diet, it's important to think strategically about ways to get adequate calories while not feeling overly full. Though a healthy diet minimizes processed foods, there can be a time and place for items like whole-grain bread, bagels, and crackers, as these foods are more quickly digested for fast and easy fuel. If you intend to exercise or train regularly while intermittent fasting, these will especially be a great source of energy on the go. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Raspberries </p>
<p> Fiber—the stuff that keeps you regular—was named a shortfall nutrient by the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines, and a recent article in Nutrients stated that less than 10 percent of Western populations consume adequate levels of whole fruits. With eight grams of fiber per cup, raspberries are a delicious, high-fiber fruit to keep you regular during your shortened feeding window. </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Lentils </p>
<p> This nutritious superstar packs a high fiber punch with 32 percent of total daily fiber needs met in only half a cup. Additionally, lentils provide a good source of iron (about 15 percent of your daily needs), another nutrient of concern, especially for active females undergoing intermittent fasting. </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> Potatoes </p>
<p> Similar to bread, white potatoes are digested with minimal effort from the body. And if paired with a protein source, they are a perfect post-workout snack to refuel hungry muscles. Another benefit that makes potatoes an important staple for the IF diet is that once cooled, potatoes form a resistant starch primed to fuel good bacteria in your gut. </p>
<p> 7 </p>
<p> Seitan </p>
<p> The EAT-Lancet Commission recently released a report calling for a dramatic reduction in animal-based proteins for optimal health and longevity. One large study directly linked the consumption of red meat to increased mortality. Make the most of your anti-aging fast by incorporating life-extending plant-based protein substitutes like seitan. Also known as "wheat meat," this food can be battered, baked, and dipped in your favorite sauces. </p>
<p> 8 </p>
<p> Hummus </p>
<p> One of the creamiest and tastiest dips known to mankind, hummus is another excellent plant-based protein and is a great way to boost the nutritional content of staples like sandwiches—just sub it in for mayonnaise. If you're adventurous enough to make your own hummus, don't forget that the secret to the perfect recipe is garlic and tahini. </p>
<p> 9 </p>
<p> Wild-Caught Salmon </p>
<p> If your goal is to be a member of the centenarian club, you might want to read up on the Blue Zones. These five geographical regions in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and the United States are well known for dietary and lifestyle choices linked to extreme longevity. One commonly consumed food across these zones is salmon, which is high in brain-boosting omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. </p>
<p> 10 </p>
<p> Soybeans </p>
<p> As if we needed another excuse to splurge for an appetizer at the sushi bar, isoflavones, one of the active compounds in soybeans, have demonstrated to inhibit UVB induced cell damage and promote anti-aging. So next time you host a dinner party in, impress your guests with a delicious recipe featuring soybeans. </p>
<p> 11 </p>
<p> Multivitamins </p>
<p> One of the proposed mechanisms behind why IF leads to weight loss is the fact that the individual simply has less time to eat and therefore eats less. While the principle of energy in versus energy out holds true, something that isn't often discussed is the risk of vitamin deficiencies while in a caloric deficit. Though a multivitamin is not necessary with a balanced diet of plenty of fruits and vegetables, life can get hectic, and a supplement can help fill the gaps. </p>
<p> 12 </p>
<p> Smoothies </p>
<p> If a daily supplement doesn't sound appealing, try springing for a double dose of vitamins by creating homemade smoothies packed with fruits and vegetables. Smoothies are a great way to consume multiple different foods, each uniquely packed with different essential nutrients. </p>
<p> Quick tip: Buying frozen can help save money and ensure ultimate freshness. </p>
<p> 13 </p>
<p> Vitamin D Fortified Milk </p>
<p> The recommended intake of calcium for an adult is 1,000 milligrams per day, about what you'd get by drinking three cups of milk per day. With a reduced feeding window, the opportunities to drink this much might be scarce, and so it is important to prioritize high-calcium foods. Vitamin D fortified milk enhances the body's absorption of calcium and will help to keep bones strong. To boost daily calcium intake, you can add milk to smoothies or cereal, or even just drink it with meals. If you're not a fan of the beverage, non-dairy sources high in calcium include tofu and soy products, as well as leafy greens like kale. </p>
<p> Red Wine </p>
<p> A glass of wine and a night of beauty sleep may keep heads turning, as the polyphenol found in grapes has distinct anti-aging effects. Humans are known to have one of the enzyme classes SIRT-1, which is thought to act upon resveratrol in the presence of a caloric deficit to enhance both insulin sensitivity and longevity. </p>
<p> 15 </p>
<p> Blueberries </p>
<p> Don't let their miniature size fool you: Blueberries are proof that good things come in small packages! Studies have shown that longevity and youthfulness is a result of anti-oxidative processes. Blueberries are a great source of antioxidants and wild blueberries are even one of the highest sources of antioxidants. Antioxidants help rid the body of free radicals and prevent widespread cellular damage. </p>
<p> 16 </p>
<p> Papaya </p>
<p> During the final hours of your fast, you'll likely start to feel the effects of hunger, especially as you first start intermittent fasting. This "hanger" may, in turn, cause you to overeat in large quantities, leaving you feeling bloated and lethargic minutes later. Papaya possesses a unique enzyme called papain that acts upon proteins to break them down. Including chunks of this tropical fruit in a protein-dense meal can help ease digestion, making any bloat more manageable. </p>
<p> 17 </p>
<p> Nuts </p>
<p> Make room on the cheese board for a mixed assortment, because nuts of all varieties are known to rid body fat and lengthen your life. A prospective trial published in the British Journal of Nutrition even associated nut consumption with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and overall mortality. </p>
<p> 18 </p>
<p> Ghee </p>
<p> Of course, you've heard a drizzle of olive oil has major health benefits, but there are plenty of other oil options out there you can use, too. You don't want to heat an oil you're cooking with beyond its smoke point, so next time you're in the kitchen whipping up a stir-fry, consider using ghee as your oil of choice. Basically just clarified butter, it has a much higher smoke point—making it a great choice for hot dishes. </p>
<p> 19 </p>
<p> Homemade Salad Dressing </p>
<p> Just like your grandmother kept her cooking wholesome and simple, so should you when it comes to salad dressings and sauces. When we opt to make our own simple dressings, unwanted additives and extra sugar are avoided. </p>
<p> 20 </p>
<p> Branch Chain Amino Acid Supplement </p>
<p> A final IF-approved supplement is the BCAA. While this muscle-building aid is most beneficial for the individual who enjoys fasted cardio or hard workouts at the crack of dawn, it can be consumed all throughout the day (fasting or not) to prevent the body from going into a catabolic state and preserve lean muscle mass. Note: If you choose to follow a vegan diet pattern, this supplement may be off-limits, as most are sourced from duck feathers. </p>

<p> Is Fish Meat? All You Need to Know </p>
<p> Many people wonder whether fish is considered meat. </p>
<p> While some claim that fish is technically a type of meat, others point out that there are many ways to classify meat. </p>
<p> Factors including religious guidelines, dietary restrictions, and nutritional differences can be used to categorize fish. </p>
<p> This article takes an in-depth look at whether fish is meat. </p>
<p> Whether fish is classified as meat varies based on how you define meat. </p>
<p> Your religious views, dietary preferences, and personal health needs can also factor into this judgment. </p>
<p> Basic definitions </p>
<p> Many people rely on the dictionary definition of meat, which is “the flesh of animals as used for food” (1). </p>
<p> By this interpretation, fish would be a type of meat. </p>
<p> However, some people consider meat to only come from warm-blooded animals, such as cattle, chickens, pigs, sheep, and birds. </p>
<p> Because fish are cold-blooded, they would not be regarded as meat under this definition. </p>
<p> Others use the term “meat” to refer exclusively to the flesh of fur-covered mammals, which excludes animals like chicken and fish. </p>
<p> Religion may play a role </p>
<p> Certain religions have specific definitions of meat and differ on whether fish counts. </p>
<p> For example, in Judaism, fish that have fins and scales are considered “pareve.” This term applies to food products that are prepared from kosher ingredients that are neither meat nor dairy (2). </p>
<p> Furthermore, Catholics often abstain from eating meat on Fridays during Lent, a religious observance that stretches for about six weeks from Ash Wednesday to Easter. </p>
<p> However, only warm-blooded animals are considered meat, and cold-blooded animals like fish are permitted during this period (3). </p>
<p> Finally, many Hindus are lacto-ovo vegetarians, meaning that they don’t eat meat, fish, or poultry but may consume some animal products, such as eggs and dairy. </p>
<p> However, those who do eat meat often distinguish between beef and pork on the one hand and other types of meat, including fish, on the other (4). </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> There are several different definitions of meat. Some religions have specific guidelines about which foods are classified as meat and whether fish is considered a type of meat. </p>
<p> The nutritional profile and potential health benefits of fish are quite different from those of other types of meat. </p>
<p> For example, red meat is high in saturated fat, vitamin B12, iron, niacin, and zinc (5, 6). </p>
<p> Meanwhile, fish is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, thiamine, selenium, and iodine (7). </p>
<p> Eating fish has been linked to several health benefits. It may lower risk factors for heart disease by helping decrease belly fat and triglyceride levels, as well as increasing levels of HDL (good) cholesterol (8). </p>
<p> One 26-year study in more than 84,000 women found that eating red meat was associated with a higher risk of heart disease, whereas eating fish, nuts, and poultry was linked to a lower risk (9). </p>
<p> Other research suggests that eating fish instead of red meat may be linked to a lower risk of metabolic syndrome. This is a group of conditions that increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes (10, 11). </p>
<p> For this reason, health organizations like the American Heart Association recommend limiting your red meat intake and eating at least two servings of fish per week as part of a healthy diet (12). </p>
<p> Some people need to restrict their intake of certain types of meat for other health reasons. </p>
<p> For example, those with an alpha-gal allergy, also known as a meat allergy, can tolerate foods like fish and poultry but may experience an allergic reaction after eating beef, pork, or lamb (13). </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> Fish offers a different set of nutrients than other types of meat and is associated with several health benefits. People with meat allergies may need to restrict beef, pork, and lamb but can generally tolerate fish. </p>
<p> Vegetarian diets generally ban meat but may include fish, depending on the version of the diet. </p>
<p> For example, vegans abstain from all animal products, including meat, fish, poultry, dairy, eggs, and honey. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, lacto-ovo-vegetarians restrict meat, fish, and poultry but eat eggs and dairy. </p>
<p> The pescatarian diet is another type of vegetarianism. It eliminates meat and poultry but permits fish and other types of seafood. </p>
<p> Other types of vegetarian diets may also include fish, such as the flexitarian diet, which allows for occasional consumption of meat, fish, and poultry. </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> Several types of vegetarian diets exist. Some, such as the pescatarian diet, may permit fish but not meat or poultry. </p>
<p> Whether fish is meat depends on whom you ask. By some definitions, fish is considered meat, and by others, it isn’t. </p>
<p> Fish is the flesh of an animal used for food, and by that definition, it’s meat. However, many religions don’t consider it meat. </p>
<p> There are also several important distinctions between fish and other types of meat, especially in terms of their nutritional profiles and potential health benefits. </p>

<p> The Ultimate Guide to Freezer-Burned Food Safety </p>
<p> And How to Prevent It </p>
<p> Erin Huffstetler is a writer with experience writing about easy ways to save money at home. </p>
<p> Is it safe to eat freezer-burned food? The quick answer is yes. Freezer burn is simply the result of air coming into contact with food, and while it may not looking appetizing, it is usually safe to eat. However, since freezer burn often affects the flavor and texture of food, you may not want to consume food with severe freezer burn. </p>
<p> All foods get freezer burn eventually, but most properly stored foods should maintain their quality in the freezer for six months to a year. If you find that your frozen foods are developing freezer burn sooner than that, it's time to do a bit of investigating to root out the cause. Improperly wrapped food or a malfunctioning freezer could be the culprits. </p>
<p> When to Use Food With Freezer Burn </p>
<p> If your food only has light freezer burn and you plan to cook it thoroughly, then defrost it properly and use as planned. If certain sections have more severe freezer burn than others, you can cut these parts away before cooking. Regardless, if freezer burn is the only problem, the food will still be safe to eat. </p>
<p> When to Toss Food With Freezer Burn </p>
<p> Freezer burn may not make food unsafe to eat, but it can affect the taste, texture, and color. Severely freezer-burned food will have an off taste that is especially noticeable in raw foods. If the freezer burn is extensive, it's best to toss the food and learn from your mistakes. </p>
<p> Note that while freezer burn on its own does not make food unsafe to eat, foods that are frozen under improper conditions can still go bad. If the food has an off smell upon defrosting, discard it. Pay attention to how long foods have been in the freezer to ensure they are eaten at peak and follow these tips to avoid freezer burn. </p>
<p> How to Avoid Freezer Burn </p>
<p> A few simple precautions will help to avoid freezer burn in the future, ensuring your frozen foods will be in peak condition when you're ready to use them. </p>
<p> Wrap Foods Correctly </p>
<p> Remove foods from their store packaging if you don't plan to use the food right away—especially when it comes to meat, poultry, and fish. The thin cellophane used to wrap meat isn't thick enough to keep air from getting in. Freezer paper or a freezer bag is much better suited for the job. There are specific steps you should take to repackage foods for the freezer to ensure they last as long as possible. </p>
<p> If you have a regular butcher that you purchase raw meat from, ask if they can wrap your order in freezer paper. </p>
<p> Use Freezer-Safe Containers </p>
<p> Not all food storage containers are designed for freezer use. Freezer-safe containers are made of thicker plastic or glass. While it may be tempting to reuse grocery store packaging to freeze foods, these types of containers aren't up to the task. Air will end up getting in, and they're just too thin to protect against the cold. The same is true for regular plastic bags. Only use bags, jars, and containers that are labeled for freezer use. While they're more expensive, you'll save money in the long run by not throwing out freezer-burned food. </p>
<p> Watch for Trapped Air </p>
<p> Air is the enemy of frozen foods. If you aren't squeezing the air out of your freezer bags before you stick them in the freezer, you're setting yourself up for early freezer burn. This is why vacuum sealers have become so popular in recent years. </p>
<p> Let Foods Cool </p>
<p> If you let hot food cool down, you can ensure that you're not trapping steam inside the packaging. Steam is not friendly to frozen food—it ends up turning into ice crystals. Plus, if food is too hot when you put it in the freezer, other foods may start to thaw out. </p>
<p> Label and Inventory </p>
<p> Label everything that goes into the freezer with the name of the item and date to help keep track of your frozen food. Different foods have different shelf lives in the freezer, and some last longer frozen than others. For example, while bacon will last only one to two months, chicken and turkey will last for up to one year. Take note of the average freezer life for each food and consider adding this expiry date to your labels. </p>
<p> Foods often develop freezer burn when they get pushed to the back of the freezer and are forgotten. Start a freezer inventory list to stay on top of what you have on hand so that you can plan meals around it—and reach for the oldest frozen product first. </p>

<p> Is my food safe to eat after a power outage? </p>
<p> What's safe, what you should toss </p>
<p> By: Marais Jacon-Duffy </p>

<p> CINCINNATI -- When the power goes out, even a stocked kitchen can begin to feel a little barren. Without appliances, some foods can't be eaten. </p>
<p> After the power is restored, though, some of that food may no longer be safe to eat. </p>
<p> First and foremost, keep the refrigerator and freezer doors shut. If you limit the number of time that cold air escapes the fridge, you'll probably be able to keep it longer. </p>
<p> Your food in the refrigerator is more at-risk to spoil than freezer food. </p>
<p> Perishable food in the fridge -- like milk, eggs, uncooked meats and cooked vegetables -- will be safe for 4-6 hours, according to the CDC. The Cincinnati Health Department says that you should worry once perishable foods have been kept at 41 degrees or warmer; 41 to 140 degrees is the "danger zone" for thawed, perishable foods. </p>
<p> Frozen foods, however, can stay safe for up to 48 hours in a closed, full freezer (a half-full freezer will keep food safe for 24 hours), the CDC says. If the foods contain ice crystals, they can be refrozen or cooked. The health department suggests adding "bags of ice or dry ice to the freezer if it appears the power will be off for an extended time." </p>
<p> If the color, odor or texture of a food is suspect, throw it out. Or, as the CDC and health department say, "When in doubt, throw it out." </p>
<p> Some foods may be sub-par after being stored at room temperature, but they will not be dangerous to eat. Butter or margarine, cheeses, condiments (excluding mayonnaise), vinegar-based salad dressings, fresh, uncut fruits, raw vegetables, pastries and fruit juices all fall into this category. </p>
<p> As a reminder, be sure to call Duke Energy to report your power outage so that they know where to restore power. </p>
<p> Here's a list of phone numbers and other helpful tips to stay safe when the power goes out. </p>
<p> If flooding also affects your area, the CDC warns people against consuming drinking water that may be unsafe. </p>
<p> Your city or county may issue a boil water advisory, which means tap water should be boiled before drinking or using to wash dishes, cook, make ice or brush teeth. Bathing with that water, however, is fine (unless otherwise noted). </p>
<p> Bottled water is still safe to drink during a flood or water advisory. </p>

<p> After Being Vegan for 3 Years, I Went Back to Meat. And This Happened… </p>
<p> The first time I ate eggs, it literally felt like I finished having Thanksgiving dinner. </p>
<p> Health and wellness touch each of us differently. This is one person’s story. </p>
<p> I was on a 100 percent plant-based diet for nearly three years. Yes, that meant my plate was only whole fruits and vegetables, grains, and legumes. I excluded all animal products, including dairy, meat, and seafood. And initially, I felt amazing. </p>
<p> My digestion was great, and I was super energized. It also felt great to no longer be contributing to the cruelty of modern animal agriculture and the negative effects livestock production has on the planet. </p>
<p> But… earlier this year, things started to change. </p>
<p> I started to have way less energy. Completing even the smallest of tasks had become a struggle. I also noticed that I was having horrible migraines before and during my menstrual cycle. At one point during my periods, I could barely get out of bed. </p>
<p> I knew something was wrong, and tried to adjust my diet in every way possible. I started eating healthier fats and iron-rich plant foods, but my symptoms didn’t change. During this time, I also had an odd, intense craving for seafood, but I wanted to continue making veganism work for my body. </p>
<p> It wasn’t until I started to have trouble digesting foods that normally went down without an issue that I decided to visit my holistic doctor. </p>
<p> I thought that maybe I developed an allergy to nuts or gluten, but my lab results revealed something even more shocking: I was critically low in iron — and my iron stores were even lower! Not only that, I was also very low in nutrients, including vitamins B-12, A, D, and zinc. I had been eating a wide variety of the healthiest foods on the planet, but my body was clearly sending a signal that it wasn’t enough. </p>
<p> My doctor was very concerned, but remained respectful of my vegan diet. She suggested a long list of different supplements to try to raise my levels, but I knew supplements weren’t the answer. </p>
<p> I had been ignoring the signals my body was sending me for a long time already. Instead of forcing my body to adapt to veganism again, it was time to start incorporating fish and other animal products into my diet. </p>
<p> It’s been about three months since I started eating animal protein again. I slowly transitioned at first by only eating fish and eggs. </p>
<p> It’s very important to me to ethically source my animal protein from the cleanest and most sustainable sources possible. I only purchase wild-caught salmon and eggs from pasture-raised, hormone- and antibiotic-free chickens. When I crave beef, I purchase grass-fed meat. </p>
<p> Here’s what I’ve noticed in my body since making the transition away from veganism: </p>
<p> I stopped waking up throughout the night </p>
<p> I didn’t realize I had been struggling with sleep until my diet changed. I noticed major changes: I wake up fewer times throughout the night and my sleep is much deeper. Before, I often woke up during the night. Now, I sleep through and wake up feeling very rested. </p>
<p> I have more energy in the morning </p>
<p> Toward the end of my time as a vegan, I struggled to wake up in the morning, let alone exercise! Since I started eating animal protein again, I have so much more energy to do everyday things. I even have enough for yoga classes and runs outside. </p>
<p> I feel more satisfied after meals </p>
<p> I used to get hungry every couple of hours. My portions were huge with all the vegetables imaginable just so I’d feel full. These portion sizes usually left me bloated and uncomfortable — not to mention frustrated when I was hungry again shortly after. </p>
<p> Since reintroducing animal protein into my diet, I transitioned to eating much smaller portions. It was a huge change for me: The first time I ate eggs, I literally felt like I had just finished Thanksgiving dinner! Now I’m able to feel satisfied after meals without overdoing it. </p>
<p> My skin cleared up </p>
<p> I’ve struggled with acne for a long time. After removing dairy from my diet, my skin cleared up a lot, but I’d still experience frequent breakouts. After I began incorporating animal protein into my diet, I noticed less inflammation and fewer breakouts. Friends and family told me my skin looked much healthier and more alive. </p>
<p> I have fewer headaches (and less menstrual symptoms) </p>
<p> Migraines are the worst. Usually they’d ramp up really badly the week before my period. The other day, I felt a migraine coming on and decided to eat some beef in an effort to boost my iron. Within a half hour, all of my headache symptoms went away. Now I make sure to eat a serving or two of meat the week prior to and during my period. It’s incredible that I haven’t had a headache since. </p>
<p> Health has always been my number one priority. As much as I wanted to remain 100 percent plant-based, it simply just wasn’t working for me. </p>
<p> Instead of judging myself by what I should or shouldn’t be eating, I started to truly listen to my body and what it needed. It’s essential to listen to our bodies and do what’s good for them, rather than what’s been good for someone else. Everyone is so unique and has individual needs that not one diet or lifestyle can fulfill. </p>
<p> Right now, I’m eating a largely plant-based diet while incorporating some fish, eggs, and meat. This is what’s making me feel my best, and I plan to continue to eat this way to honor my body. Remember, when it comes to health, listen to your body first before the opinions of others (of course, unless it’s your doctor). Do what feels best for your body! </p>

<p> Is It Really OK To Eat Food That’s Fallen On The Floor? </p>
<p> It’s not still good. Sharon Sperry Bloom/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND </p>
<p> When you drop a piece of food on the floor, is it really OK to eat if you pick up within five seconds? This urban food myth contends that if food spends just a few seconds on the floor, dirt and germs won’t have much of a chance to contaminate it. Research in my lab has focused on how food and food contact surfaces become contaminated, and we’ve done some work on this particular piece of wisdom. </p>
<p> While the “five-second rule” might not seem like the most pressing issue for food scientists to get to the bottom of, it’s still worth investigating food myths like this one because they shape our beliefs about when food is safe to eat. </p>
<p> So is five seconds on the floor the critical threshold that separates an edible morsel from a case of food poisoning? It’s a bit a more complicated than that. It depends on just how much bacteria can make it from floor to food in a few seconds and just how dirty the floor is. </p>
<p> Where Did The Five-Second Rule Come From? </p>
<p> Wondering if food is still OK to eat after it’s been dropped on the floor (or anywhere else) is a pretty common experience. And it’s probably not a new one either. </p>
<p> A well-known, but inaccurate, story about Julia Child may have contributed to this food myth. Some viewers of her cooking show, The French Chef, insist they saw Child drop lamb (or a chicken or a turkey, depending on the version of the tale) on the floor and pick it up, with the advice that if they were alone in the kitchen, their guests would never know. </p>
<p> In fact it was a potato pancake, and it fell on the stovetop, not on the floor. Child put it back in the pan, saying “But you can always pick it up and if you are alone in the kitchen, who is going to see?” But the misremembered story persists. </p>
<p> It’s harder to pin down the origins of the oft-quoted five-second rule, but a 2003 study reported that 70% of women and 56% of men surveyed were familiar with the five-second rule and that women were more likely than men to eat food that had been dropped on the floor. </p>
<p> So what does science tell us about what a few moments on the floor means for the safety of your food? </p>
<p> Five Seconds Is All It Takes </p>
<p> The earliest research report on the five-second rule is attributed to Jillian Clarke, a high school student participating in a research apprenticeship at the University of Illinois. Clarke and her colleagues inoculated floor tiles with bacteria then placed food on the tiles for varying times. </p>
<p> They reported bacteria were transferred from the tile to gummy bears and cookies within five seconds, but didn’t report the specific amount of bacteria that made it from the tile to the food. </p>
<p> But How Much Bacteria Actually Transfer In Five Seconds? </p>
<p> In 2007, my lab at Clemson University published a study – the only peer-reviewed journal paper on this topic – in the Journal of Applied Microbiology. We wanted to know if the length of time food is in contact with a contaminated surface affected the rate of transfer of bacteria to the food. </p>
<p> To find out, we inoculated squares of tile, carpet or wood with Salmonella. Five minutes after that, we placed either bologna or bread on the surface for five, 30 or 60 seconds, and then measured the amount of bacteria transferred to the food. We repeated this exact protocol after the bacteria had been on the surface for two, four, eight and 24 hours. </p>
<p> We found that the amount of bacteria transferred to either kind of food didn’t depend much on how long the food was in contact with the contaminated surface – whether for a few seconds or for a whole minute. The overall amount of bacteria on the surface mattered more, and this decreased over time after the initial inoculation. It looks like what’s at issue is less how long your food languishes on the floor and much more how infested with bacteria that patch of floor happens to be. </p>
<p> We also found that the kind of surface made a difference as well. Carpets, for instance, seem to be slightly better places to drop your food than wood or tile. When carpet was inoculated with Salmonella, less than 1% of the bacteria were transferred. But when the food was in contact with tile or wood, 48%-70% of bacteria transferred. </p>
<p> Last year, a study from from Aston University in the UK used nearly identical parameters to our study and found similar results testing contact times of three and 30 seconds on similar surfaces. They also reported that 87% of people asked either would eat or have eaten food dropped on the floor. </p>
<p> Should You Eat Food That’s Fallen On The Floor? </p>
<p> From a food safety standpoint, if you have millions or more cells on a surface, 0.1% is still enough to make you sick. Also, certain types of bacteria are extremely virulent, and it takes only a small amount to make you sick. For example, 10 cells or less of an especially virulent strain of E. coli can cause severe illness and death in people with compromised immune systems. But the chance of these bacteria being on most surfaces is very low. </p>
<p> And it’s not just dropping food on the floor that can lead to bacterial contamination. Bacteria are carried by various “media,” which can include raw food, moist surfaces where bacteria has been left, our hands or skin and from coughing or sneezing. </p>
<p> Hands, foods and utensils can carry individual bacterial cells, colonies of cells or cells living in communities contained within a protective film that provide protection. These microscopic layers of deposits containing bacteria are known as biofilms and they are found on most surfaces and objects. </p>
<p> Biofilm communities can harbor bacteria longer and are very difficult to clean. Bacteria in these communities also have an enhanced resistance to sanitizers and antibiotics compared to bacteria living on their own. </p>
<p> So the next time you consider eating dropped food, the odds are in your favor that you can eat that morsel and not get sick. But in the rare chance that there is a microorganism that can make you sick on the exact spot where the food dropped, you can be fairly sure the bug is on the food you are about to put in your mouth. </p>
<p> Research (and common sense) tell us that the best thing to do is to keep your hands, utensils and other surfaces clean. </p>

<p> Is It Safe to Eat Your Food If a Fly Has Landed on It? </p>
<p> You’ve probably heard that flies vomit as soon as they land on a surface… </p>
<p> Flies. The bane of everyone’s existence. You just want to enjoy a nice picnic outside or dine out on the patio section of the restaurant, but those buzzing pests always seem to find your dinner plate as their landing grounds. </p>
<p> Once a fly lands on your food, what’s the deal? Is it safe to eat? Or is it infested with pathogens? </p>
<p> There are hundreds of different fly species around the world, but the one that’s most likely taking a stroll over your filet mignon is the common house fly, or Musca domestica. These are the nuisances that hang around in our homes and dumpsters, and are closely associated with rotting organic waste, including dead animals and feces. Ich. </p>
<p> This is why it’s not just the fly itself that matters when it comes to passing on harmful bacteria and viruses, but also where it’s been. Since flies typically spend time in rotting animal waste and garbage, there can be a range of pathogens and parasites among this waste. </p>
<p> Unlike mosquitoes, house flies don’t transmit pathogens through their saliva by biting. Instead, they transmit them on their feet and body, leaving behind pathogen-filled footprints. To add the icing to the cake, they leave behind poop and vomit too. </p>
<p> If that wasn’t enough to gross you out, brace yourself for this: flies don’t have teeth, so instead of taking a bite out of our food, they have to spit out some enzyme-rich saliva that dissolves it. This allows them to suck up the resulting mishmash of regurgitated digestive fluids and dissolved food. Yum. </p>
<p> While the whole process is undoubtedly repulsive, spotting a fly on your food doesn’t mean you need to throw it away in most instances. One or two touchdowns on a sandwich is unlikely to end up causing an illness for the average healthy person. </p>
<p> However, the chances of the pests leaving behind populations of pathogens are much higher if it has plenty of time to walk around on your food. The more time the pests spend walking around vomiting, pooping, and sucking in, the higher chance of delivering harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. </p>
<p> So basically, once you spot a fly buzzing around your dinner table or kitchen preparation area, make sure you swat it away from your delicious, non-pathogen-infected eats. One or two lands likely won’t make a difference, but if the fly has strutted its stuff across your food, it’s probably best to throw it out. You know what they say — it’s better to be safe than sorry. </p>

<p> I've Been Vegan for 5 Years, but I'm Starting to Eat Fish Again—Here's Why </p>
<p> After nixing animal products for nearly five years, I'm reassessing things. </p>

<p> I kind of became vegan on accident. I had previously gone (mostly) vegetarian for a summer in college to lose that infamous "Freshman 10"—I blame the late-night Taco Bell—but never thought I could nix meat and dairy for good. Chicken, yogurt and cheese were all foods I ate pretty much every day, and I was a self-proclaimed connoisseur of meaty chili and grilled cheese. However, after going vegan with my mom for a month as an experiment, we surprised ourselves by deciding we didn't want to go back. </p>
<p> I had lost weight, my skin was glowing and I just felt SO. GOOD. I also went from getting sick once a month to maybe once a year. Our improved quality of life was enough to get my sister and several friends to join our band of vegan misfits. Trust me, it wasn't as cool five years ago as it is now—and it still really isn't today where I live in Alabama. </p>
<p> I never would have thought that I would still be eating like a herbivore five years later, but my experience as a vegan has actually helped me become more passionate about food, cooking and, of course, the power of plant-forward eating. Dare I say, it has actually made me a better cook. However, after an internal struggle, I have recently decided to reincorporate fish into my diet. </p>
<p> I don't have any kind of "holier than thou" complex because I'm vegan, and I would never judge a person for choosing to eat meat, dairy or eggs. There is so much scientific research out there to show the benefits of consuming a variety of animal foods—fish especially—I just wasn't going to. But why? I eventually started to realize I'd been putting myself in a box—that eating a vegan diet had become a bigger part of my identity than I'd realized—and it was kind of controlling me. </p>
<p> I had long used my vegan diet to fan an old flame—my eating disorder—and had restricted my diet to fit my vision of "clean eating" to stay thin and "in control." Then, when I started putting on a few pounds in the last year or two, I started to spiral. I began to count calories again, only let myself have green smoothies for breakfast and salads for lunch—all while taking spin classes or running most days of the week. This was total self-sabotage looking back, because I often ended up binge eating at night since my body was in desperate need of calories! </p>
<p> My original quest for better health had morphed into a quest for perfection, and my mind and body were starting to feel the consequences. I had also realized I wasn't prioritizing certain nutrients—like iodine and omega-3 fats, which are both found in several types of fish. My body had begun to crave seafood again for the first time in years (likely because of this), and I've realized the value of listening to my body instead of punishing it to get results. I'd been reading the book Body Kindness by Rebecca Scritchfield and finally understood that my body was my friend, not my foe, and if I would just take better care of it, we could grow to like each other after all. </p>
<p> This week, I decided to take the plunge and headed to Whole Foods to buy some salmon fillets (wild-caught and as sustainable as I could find). I whipped up a salmon grain bowl with lots of veggies (a la the The Pollan Family's Mostly Plants), and the world did not come crashing down. And yes, I did enjoy it. </p>
<p> I still currently plan to eat vegan about 90 percent of the time, as I honestly do feel better when I don't have meat and dairy in my system. The whole concept of eggs has weirded me out since I was a kid, so those likely won't be making an entrance into my diet any time soon. However, enjoying some sustainable seafood once a week is something I do want to start prioritizing. It doesn't make me a failure for not remaining a full-time herbivore. It's actually freeing to feel like my diet isn't my entire identity. And if my body decides it needs something different in the future—be it going back to strict veganism or eating yogurt from a cow instead of almonds—this time I'm going to listen. </p>

<p> Why environmentalists eat meat </p>
<p> Figures </p>
<p> Abstract </p>
<p> Why do people who care about the environment adopt behaviours that are not consistent with their beliefs? Previous studies approach this as a case of cognitive dissonance, researchers looking into the strategies through which people reduce gaps between their attitudes and their behaviours. Here we start from the premise that there is no dissonance, and that people have consistent reasons of why they are doing what they are doing. The research task is then to shed light on these reasons. Using Q-methodology, a mixed quantitative-qualitative approach, we interviewed 42 environmentally-minded researchers asking them why they eat meat. Our interviewees were aware of and cared about the environmental and ethical impacts of meat eating, but reasoned that they eat meat because either technological, or political changes are more important than what they personally do, because of doubts about the impact of personal action in a complex world, or simply because they lack the determination to stop eating meat. Our analysis suggests that policies and messages that try to educate or guilt meat-eaters are unlikely to work with those well aware of the impacts of their actions. </p>

<p> Introduction </p>
<p> People often say one thing about the environment and do another. The ‘meat paradox’ refers to the observation that many people who care for animal welfare and are concerned with the impacts of meat production, follow meat diets with harmful effects[1]. Such ‘attitude-behaviour’ (or belief-action) gaps are not just a matter of misinformation [2–4]. Economists for example have argued that personal preferences are revealed in consumer choices—what matters is what people do, not what they say or believe[5]. Others show how behaviours are bounded by social norms and cultural contexts, not simply determined by beliefs [6,7]. In social practice theory, actions and beliefs form together through practice [8,9]. For example, socialization and everyday practice make people reluctant to stop meat [10]. Separate research looks at individual and structural—social and institutional—constraints to behavioral change [6]. </p>
<p> A different strand of literature is looking at how people deal with ‘cognitive dissonance’ between their beliefs and actions [11]. Research has shown that when people do not harmonize dissonance by aligning behavior to beliefs (e.g. stop eating meat if they are environmentalists), they change beliefs to justify actions (e.g. deny the impacts of meat-eating) [12]. People may ‘neutralize’ unethical behaviors by denying personal responsibility or injury (e.g. deny the effects of eating meat), by condemning those who condemn them (e.g. blame vegetarians as hypocrites), or by justifying their actions in terms of a broader good (e.g. argue that meat-eating is good for the economy) [13]. We know from previous studies that meat eaters may dissociate from meat production and its environmental or animal welfare effects [14]; or justify eating meat as ‘natural, necessary, normal, or nice’ [15]. </p>
<p> Many empirical studies in this vein try to measure the distance between environmental beliefs and actions [16], and explain the attributes that make certain people more prone to certain behaviors [17], or else identify the strategies that people use to reduce the dissonance and justify their actions. The assumption is that there is a ‘proper’ environmental behaviour, and that if someone cares for the environment and does not follow this practice, then there is dissonance. Here instead, we take a different path. We do not assume distance or dissonance, but rather that people have consistent reasons for doing what they do. We want to hear from people themselves, in this case informed people who care about the environment, how they explain their actions. Q-methodology [18], a quantitative-qualitative approach has been used by others for deciphering people’s diverse viewpoints (‘discourses´) on an issue and is ideal for elucidating how people reason about what they do, without prior assumption of consistency or dissonance. Unlike regression analysis that looks for correlations between variables across a sample of subjects, Q looks for correlations between subjects and their viewpoints across a sample of variables [19]. Strongly correlated viewpoints form an identifiable ‘discourse’–a shared way of viewing, and talking about an issue. </p>
<p> Materials and methods </p>
<p> For our research we followed the standardised steps of Q-methodology. Q has a different logic than conventional, statistics-oriented survey research and we explain this here. These differences need to be kept in mind when evaluating our sample selection or interpreting our results (for more details of study design, analysis, and results see also Supplementary Information). </p>
<p> We started with a review of academic literature, media and popular texts, as well as four long interviews with experts through which we produced what in Q terminology is called the ‘concourse’–a list of 116 statements that people use to justify why they eat meat. A final sample of 30 statements was produced through formal procedures, using a two-axed ‘concourse matrix’ to sort statements, with categories based on rationality types, existing studies of meat-eating, and by open coding extraneous statements. (see full list in Supplementary Information). We then conducted pilot interviews and corrected some statements for clarity. </p>
<p> Representativeness in Q refers to representativeness of the statements (Q-set), not the type and number of individuals interviewed. Unlike standard survey and regression analysis, Q methodology establishes patterns within and across individuals and their views, not across individual traits [20]. In Q “it is not the ‘constructors’–the participants—who are the focus but the ‘constructions’ themselves” [21]. For those familiar with regression analysis, it may be helpful to think of interviewees as the variables and Q statements as the cases. The method does not require then large numbers of participants to produce valid results [22]. The objective is not to interview a sample representative of a larger population, but a focused, yet varied set of people with well-informed but different views to capture the diversity in the universe of thoughts as much as possible. </p>
<p> We interviewed forty-two meat-eaters from our own research institute (ICTA-UAB), the reasoning being that environmental researchers care about the environment and know the impacts of meat-eating and so fit to the study’s purpose of inquiring into the meat-paradox. Unlike previous studies that have focussed on the meat-eating motivations of the population at large, we were interested to see here how people that one would think more prone to being vegetarian, justify their choice to eat meat. Researchers at ICTA-UAB fit this profile perfectly, with the added advantage that they have a diversity of educational backgrounds, fields, nationalities, ages and politics, which is an important property for a Q-study that seeks to capture the variety of discourses at stake (see Table 1). We ensured that this diversity was reflected in the sample of people that we interviewed. </p>
<p> It is worth noting that a Q study should not be interpreted as a survey—for which obviously a sample of forty-two researchers from our own institute would be biased and of limited significance. Instead, a Q-study elucidates different discourses at stake—and for discerning such differences researchers in our institute are a good basis (bearing of course the limitations that we discuss at the end of the paper, in extrapolating differences observed in our sample to all environmentally-aware meat eaters). </p>
<p> We interviewed each researcher separately and gave her or him 30 cards, each with one statement, asking to value them from most unlike (-4) to most like (+4) their view in a Q grid of a forced, normal distribution shape. Each participant produced hence what is called in the literature a ‘Q sort’–a ranking of statements. Interviewees could rearrange the resulting rank in an order that best expressed their opinion (Q-methodology allows for this, because it recognizes that people often think about ideas in relation to one another and not in isolation). Participants were then interviewed, asked about highest, lowest, or unusual choices (meaning those very different when compared to previously observed sorts) and welcomed to offer more comments about their choices. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and salient quotes were used to support the factor analysis. </p>
<p> Q-methodology generates distinct discourses through factor analysis. Data analysis was carried out using PQ-Method, a software for Q-studies [23]. As most Q-studies, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Varimax rotation [19]. PCA extracts distinct factors (representing discourses) based on a correlation matrix between Q-sorts. Each Q-sort’s level of correlation with each factor is then calculated, indicating the respondent’s level of agreement with that viewpoint. The factors are ‘rotated’ to clarify viewpoints [24]. Varimax statistical rotation maximizes the variance across factors. Sorts are then ‘flagged’—it is decided whether they will be included in the final computation of factors. Sorts which correlate too highly with multiple factors, or with no factors, are excluded. Flagging was first done automatically but then manually inspected and corrected, applying a threshold based on a standard formula (2.58(1/√n), where n = the total number of statements) and recommended procedures in Q. Finally, the representative sort for each discourse is computed (with values of +1, +2 etc.) along with statistically significant distinguishing and consensus statements, providing the basis for interpreting the discourses. </p>
<p> The above process was carried out in examining solutions of 2–7 factors. Ultimately we decided on a 4-factor solution (see Table 2 with 4 discourses). Other solutions produced factors with no significantly correlating sorts, sorts which correlated significantly with multiple factors, sorts which correlated with no factors, or factors which did not appear meaningful on closer inspection. Another major concern was that other solutions produced higher interfactor correlations, meaning less distinctive viewpoints. </p>
<p> Results and discussion </p>
<p> The statistical analysis of rankings identified four discernible viewpoints or discourses, summarised in Table 2 and explained below. In line with standard Q practice, we report on statements for which there is statistically significant difference between interviewees that chose them and interviewees that did not. It is around such differences that we discern four distinguishable groups. In other words, certain statements ranked by our respondents will not show up in Table 2 as they were not statistically different among groups. </p>
<p> Different to Q study convention, we present a consensus statement first, because it helps see the common ground with which all four discourses develop. The consensus statement (#S7) indicates that none of the discourses differs in terms of the importance participants give to meat-eating compared to other environmental concerns: they all give it more or less the same importance—not more, nor less. </p>
<p> In Discourse 1 (D1), Optimism, respondents explained that they keep eating meat not because it is natural (#S15, #S9) or only because they like it (#S30), but mostly because change will be easier in the future (#S22, #S19)–be it because it will be easier for them to change (#S22), or because technology will overcome the negative effects of meat production (#S19). People in this group talked more than others about practical ‘solutions’–technologies and economic policies that reduce meat consumption or impacts (#I22, #I32). We characterise this discourse as an optimistic discourse that expects things to become better in the future, broadly in line with eco-modernist or technologically optimistic discourses that expect that environmental problems, however hard, can and will be solved in the future. </p>
<p> For the System-Focus discourse (D2), views seem to coalesce around the idea that the problem is the system not the meat. This discourse does not share the technological optimism of the Optimism discourse (#S19) and sees change as a matter of political change, not personal habits (#S18). Interviewees talked of ‘big businesses’ and ‘politicians or powerful people in the agro-industrial sector’ that push profit-driven technologies and make it impossible for small-scale farms to subsist (#I28, #I26). As one interviewee put it, this is ‘a political issue and an issue of capitalism… It’s worse [to not eat meat] because you convince yourself that you’re doing something good’ (#I28). For System-Focus discourse holders, eating meat is not a matter of taste or expressing wealth (#S29), but of enjoying it with others (#S16). The discourse does not reject that animals suffer less than humans (#S1), and is the only discourse that held that the impacts of meat are exaggerated (#S5), at least compared to other environmental problems or problems with other staples (one interviewee mentioned ‘child labor exploitation in soy production’ (#I31)). Respondents here reason that they eat meat, because changing their own behaviour will not make a difference, unless the system changes as a whole. </p>
<p> In contrast, for those sharing the Complexity discourse (D3) it is individual, rather than political change that matters (#S18) (also unlike System-Focus, Complexity holds that the impacts of meat-eating are not exaggerated (#S5)). This line of reasoning does not reject that price is an issue for adopting a vegetarian diet (#S2), finds little importance in engaging with the question of the capacity of technology to resolve animal welfare problems (#S19), is sensitive to the suffering of animals (#S1), rejects social pressure (#S20), and is concerned with the effects of personal action (#S4). An underlying theme for this discourse is personal responsibility. ‘Consumers should take responsibility for their choices’, one interviewee said (#I37); and another: ‘every choice has an impact, everything has an effect’ (#I11). </p>
<p> From the ranking and correlation of statements (Table 2), it is not clear why those who shared this discourse keep eating meat. In interviews though many attributed their inaction to ‘complexity’. This fits the agnostic position of the group regarding technology (#S19). As one respondent for example said ‘being responsible …is more complex …It’s not a yes or no. It’s how much, when, for what purpose’ (#I37). Or as another put it: ‘it’s very difficult to establish a relationship of causality between what you do and what happens. There are too many variables … It’s nice to imagine that we are being nice and saving the world but it’s complicated, especially with food” (#I2). </p>
<p> Unlike the first three discourses, those in the fourth believed that personal action can make a difference, albeit is hard to come by. This Feebleness discourse (D4) holds that although giving up eating meat makes sense, the necessary will to actually do it is not there. Feebleness accepts that there are sustainable alternatives to industrial farming (#S14), and that technology won’t solve environmental and animal suffering from industrial meat production (#S19). What is more, there is a clearly positive view of vegetarianism evident in rejecting alleged environmental impacts of widespread vegetarianism (#S8) and that a vegetarian identity can be a social drawback (#S23). </p>
<p> Still, distance from food animals makes it hard to connect meat consumption with their suffering (#S24). Simply, meat is delicious (#S30). Respondents realized their ‘weakness’ and admired those who give up meat. ‘Putting your ideals [above] your own pleasure…making your life difficult for your ideals is something that I admire’, affirmed one interviewee (#I25). ‘They’ve made a less selfish decision than I have’, said another (#I36). </p>
<p> If Optimism, System-Focus, and Complexity discourses justify inaction on the basis of the belief that it is a matter of technology, politics, or simply too complex to do anything about it, Feebleness discourse-holders accepted that they should stop eating meat, admired those that do, but conceded that they simply cannot do it. In other words, this group lives with its contradictions. </p>
<p> Our findings are enlightening given existing empirical studies on meat-eating. In Sedova et al., the most similar study to ours, promises of future behaviour change were more common among the environmental studies students they interviewed than in the general population [4]. This finding is echoed in the Optimism discourse of our study, supporting the idea that promises of future behaviour change are common among environmentally educated individuals. </p>
<p> The most widely cited articles on the ‘meat-paradox’ focus on consumer prejudice towards animals, specifically how many people deny that the animals can suffer or question their moral status [1,25]. In our environmentally-minded sample instead, such arguments (#S1, #S13) were among the ones our interlocutors most disagreed with. Again, this may be the result of the environmental profile of our participants and their education levels. </p>
<p> Building on previous studies typifying justifications, Piazza et al. found that the vast majority (83–91%) of justifications fell under the ‘4Ns’–that eating meat is natural, necessary, normal, or nice (i.e.: enjoyable) [15]. However, discourses 1–3 in our study emphasize systemic reasons, which differ greatly from common justifications that arose in Piazza et al.’s study and are not easily captured by such categories. Such differences support the idea that justification of meat-eating is more complex among more environmentally-aware individuals. Such samples warrant further study, especially given the increasing emphasis on environmental issues in the popular media. </p>
<p> Conclusions </p>
<p> Previous research has assumed that if people think that eating meat is bad and they keep eating, then there must be some cognitive dissonance—studies in this line focus then on understanding the scale and drivers of this dissonance or how people alleviate it. Our approach acknowledges that subjects can have coherent reasons for their choice to eat meat. The question then is how do people reason and explain their apparently unsustainable actions given their environmental beliefs. </p>
<p> Rather than ignoring and denying the problem or excusing their actions, the people we interviewed here in effect question whether personal action makes a difference (Discourses 1–3). If one approaches this from a cognitive dissonance perspective, the conclusion could be that people appeal to systemic forces (technology, politics or complexity) or the future to excuse their inaction and be at peace with themselves. Our approach instead opens the possibility that subjects may well have internalized views that are quite common in sustainability science. For example, they may consider that barriers to sustainable agriculture are structural, causation is complex, and solutions are political or technological, rather than a matter of individual consumption. </p>
<p> These are all valid claims and there is no reason why they should only be seen as excuses. People may not be excusing themselves or reducing their dissonance, but truly acting in accordance with their beliefs, beliefs aligned with both caring for the effects of meat-eating and continuing to eat meat. If people believe that changing their behavior will not make much of a difference, because the solution is primarily technological or political, or a complex combination of all, then there is no paradox or dissonance to begin with. People justify coherently their choice (Discourses 1–3), or simply live with their contradictions, aware and easy with the fact that they are contradictions, unlike cases of dissonance (Discourse 4). </p>
<p> Q-methodology is good for identifying the variety of subjective viewpoints on an issue, but to assess how common the four views identified here are and who holds them, representative surveys and regressions are necessary. If the views identified here are prevalent, at least among environmentally minded people, then policies or messages seeking to inform these people about the environmental consequences of their actions, or to guilt them into stopping their environmentally damaging behaviour, in this case eating meat, are likely to be less effective. People in discourses 1–3 do not agree that becoming vegetarians will make a difference, while those in discourse 4 have surrendered to the fact that they cannot become vegetarians. Nudging people into certain environmental behaviours might be more difficult than previously thought, not because people don't care or because they haven’t heard about these problems and appropriate behaviours, but because they do not believe that it is a change in behaviours that will really make a difference. </p>

<p> Kratom and Food – How should you eat around Kratom? </p>
<p> If you do your research on kratom you will notice a lot of people talking about kratom and food. </p>
<p> Kratom and food should not be taken at the same time so that the most pronounced kratom effect can occur. </p>
<p> Kratom and Food however are very tricky things to intertwine together, I feel like I have been trying to figure out taking kratom and food together for muscle building aspects. </p>
<p> Although to this present day, I still do not eat loads of food, I still think the following post will interest you as far as kratom and food go. </p>
<p> Can I eat While Taking My Kratom? </p>
<p> The main reason kratom and food should not be taken together is because kratom attaches to receptors in your stomach. (Also to your digestive track so you can get away with eating and still feel kratom effects) </p>
<p> If your stomach is full of food, the kratom cannot bind AS WELL as it could if your stomach was empty. </p>
<p> There is a way, however, to make kratom and food work for you. </p>
<p> I have never become a ripped beast using kratom and food, but I have definitely lost a lot of weight and used it to show a lot of definition in my body. </p>
<p> Some people could actually use kratom and food to finally get the six pack they have wanted. Click Here to Read More </p>
<p> Kratom naturally gives you appetite suppression, this is why I mention you may be able to get the six pack abs. </p>
<p> The reason being is that when you overload on calories, your abs are the first thing to disappear. </p>
<p> Using kratom and food to your advantage, will definitely bring you to your goals, if done right. </p>
<p> Kratom and Appetite </p>
<p> When it comes to the topic of Kratom and Appetite I had to do some personal research on this topic. </p>
<p> I was not sure if this was same every time I took kratom or it was a hit or miss thing. </p>
<p> What I have learned is that you can use kratom as a appetite suppressor OR Enhancer. </p>
<p> For the longest time I have been looking for something that MAKES me eat. </p>
<p> In the growing business of losing weight, most supplement stores have loads of ingredients that will help you suppress your appetite but have never found one to boost it. </p>
<p> I have been trying to figure out if kratom has been boosting my appetite and I have to say that it does seem to be when I use it in a certain way. </p>
<p> Kratom After Food: I found that when you take kratom AFTER your primary breakfast meal it will dramatically boost my appetite. </p>
<p> Eating breakfast in and of itself will make you hungrier through out the day but I have found with kratom I tend to feel hungry all day. </p>
<p> This is not always the case as it find it is hard to eat a lot. My history with food is extremely unhealthy. </p>
<p> I have a past and present of eating sugary type foods and a lot of fast food. </p>
<p> This is obviously not something that I am recommending but it is something that I must live with and fight to change. </p>
<p> Kratom Before Food: Alternatively, when I take kratom BEFORE my breakfast I find that it is a very helpful appetite suppressor. </p>
<p> Also without food the kratom effect is more pronounced and is usually recommended. </p>
<p> The fact that kratom suppresses your appetite does leave one to ask different questions such as: </p>
<p> Is it healthy to not eat? </p>
<p> What should I do about no appetites? </p>
<p> Is there something I should know about the way Im not eating? </p>
<p> I have taken the liberty to talk about it and explain how I personally use kratom for intermittent fasting. </p>
<p> Kratom Effects and food </p>
<p> Taking kratom on an empty stomach IS the recommended way to take it and will give you more effects. Depending on your personal lifestyle it may not be beneficial to starve yourself to have an effect. </p>
<p> As I workout and body build I need to eat a sufficient amount of food (which I always had trouble doing) and without eating anything there is no way to build any muscle. </p>
<p> When both kratom and food are found in my stomach at the same time, the kratom effects are not as pronounced as when I do not eat but all I need to do is up my dose by a TINY bit. </p>
<p> With this lifestyle, I am able to gain strength and still feel the kratom effects. Obviously some people will need to not eat before taking kratom BUT if you don’t workout than you don’t need to eat as much. You’ll find it, check out the kratom guide and you will be able to find your sweet spot in one of the blog posts there. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> To conclude this topic on Kratom and Food I would like to invite you to try it yourself. Of course we are all different and will all feel things in different ways. </p>
<p> Some people will benefit more on using the plant on an empty stomach rather than a half full one and that fine too. Depending on what your primary use for kratom is, than make sure you are doing what is necessary to stay safe and healthy. </p>
<p> It is very important to get the minimum amount of calories from food you eat in a day. This is why some people may have trouble with kratom and food. </p>
<p> 1.People who rarely eat could get help from kratom and food OR it could be worst meaning they eat even less than what they currently eat. </p>
<p> 2.People who rarely have empty stomachs (besides the morning) may find the kratom and food aspect daunting for the fact that they never feel the full effects by having an empty stomach </p>
<p> Again like everyone is different you may need an empty stomach. </p>
<p> You may not be able to eat with it at first because the effects will be new, but, within 5 days you will be able to apply this to your routine. </p>
<p> Share your opinions on kratom and food in the comments below, also let me know what you do for kratom and food. </p>
<p> 14 Responses </p>
<p> Hi I’ve found that the most important factor in play with kratom effect & food is less about the last meal and more about the last bowel movement. Example: If my last meal was 3 hours ago (no bowel movement) and I take kratom, the effects would be weaker than if I had eaten 30 minutes ago, had a good bowel movement and then taken kratom. So for me it also becomes a question of staying as regular as possible. But as someone else mentioned, taking kratom on an empty stomach isn’t alpha omega. Personally I never take anything on an empty stomach, since being hungry makes me agitated and any “drug” i consume in that state simply furthers the agitation. </p>
<p> I’m still trying to find a sweet spot with my food. I’m using it for suboxone withdrawals. So I dose regularly at this point. I can’t not eat, because I’m not healthy. I also have a physical job that’s I need energy for. I’m going to try tea. I’ve heard it works on a full stomach. I have to be able to do both. At this point in my therapy,I must eat 3 times per day. I also must dose 3-5 daily to remain functional and comfortable. I’ll update. Eating doesn’t destroy the effects. But it drastically reduces it. </p>
<p> Although kratom may work on an non empty stomach, I rather take it on an empty stomach for a couple of reasons. </p>
<p> 1. If I take it with food I tend to get bloated and burp a lot, as if I am full after eating a big meal. 2. I have always found taking kratom without food to be a more intense effect than with food. 3. I feel that for me it always hits better on an empty stomach. Same as pre workouts or anything that results in energy (but everyone is different) </p>
<p> Hi, I spoke with Brad of Botanical Kratom about the issue of food and Kratom. I told him that I get the most effect when taking Kratom on an empty stomach. He told me it was a placebo effect and that, in fact, kratom works it’s magic in the digestive track and not the stomach. He said that eating with kratom is totally fine and will not affect it performance because of the above. He even said that eating fast food at the same time as taking kratom was very effective. I have serious crashing eating an hour or two after taking it on an empty stomach. He told me to take it with food. What are your thoughts about this since you are affiliated with Botanical Kratom and may know Brad. Could you add anything to the conversation? </p>
<p> I hear you on that one for sure man, I too hit the gym, however I do not eat as much as I should due to time (excuse I know!) </p>
<p> Try taking your kratom about 1 hour after eating and see the effect. I personally wait 45 – 60 minutes after a meal to take my kratom, however as you mentioned, the effects are not as pronounced. I do still get a decent effect that helps me accomplish the task that I am using kratom for. </p>
<p> I have found that kratom really only helps me, as I take it for chronic pain, on a fairly empty stomach. Problem is being so involved in body building, I eat every 3 hours at least, so it is not nearly as effective for me. </p>
<p> You speak of Tim Hortens, does that mean you are in Canada like myself ?. I am just beginning on my Kratom journey, it sounds like you have a lot of useful information . I am hoping you can help me. </p>
<p> […] an empty stomach and are unsure of how to work this around your schedule, make sure to check out kratom and food to find out how you should eat around […] </p>
<p> […] an empty stomach or not. In my early stages I was only dosing on empty stomach. Make sure to see how you should eat around kratom if you are looking for more on this […] </p>

<p> Lactose intolerance - foods to eat and foods to avoid </p>
<p> There are plenty of foods that can be enjoyed by those with lactose intolerance, a type of dairy intolerance, even some that contain small amounts of dairy. However, it’s important to know what foods are good for you and which ones you should avoid to prevent the often embarrassing side effects that come with lactose intolerance. </p>
<p> Finding a balance in your diet is beneficial for managing your lactose intolerance while at the same time ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. Lactose is found in milk and milk products, as well as other foods and drinks. </p>
<p> What is lactose intolerance? </p>
<p> Lactose intolerance is an inability to digest lactose, a type of sugar found in milk and dairy products. Lactose intolerance occurs when you don’t produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is responsible for breaking down lactose. </p>
<p> Side effects of dairy consumption if you have lactose intolerance include, diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, nausea and cramps, which can be uncomfortable and embarrassing if you are around other people. </p>
<p> Can I have lactose if I am lactose intolerant? </p>
<p> People with lactose intolerance can be affected to varying degrees, but the majority of people with lactose intolerance can tolerate small amounts of dairy products. A total of 12 -15 grams of lactose, which is equivalent to about one glass of milk, can usually be consumed with mild or no symptoms. And, if the lactose is consumed across a whole day, a person with lactose intolerance may even be able to have twice this amount of lactose. </p>
<p> Foods to eat if you have lactose intolerance </p>
<p> Low-lactose dairy foods </p>
<p> Butter. Butter is a high fat product that has most of the milk components that contain lactose removed during processing. Butters made from fermented milk products or ghee (clarified butter) are even lower in lactose </p>
<p> Cheese. Cheese has most of the lactose drained off during the manufacturing process. The small amount of lactose left is converted to lactic acid by the bacteria used in the cheesemaking process. The longer a cheese ages the more the lactose reduces. Therefore, hard, aged cheeses such as cheddar, parmesan and swiss have low levels of lactose. Soft cheeses like brie, blue, camembert and feta are also low in lactose and can be tolerated by some people </p>
<p> Yogurt. Full fat or greek yogurt with ‘live active cultures’ or ‘probiotics’, which are a bacteria that feeds on the sugar, essentially eat up most of the lactose </p>
<p> Lactose-free alternatives </p>
<p> Lactose-free or dairy-free unsweetened alternatives can be a healthy replacement for regular dairy products. These can be used in baking too. Look for: </p>
<p> Milks such as almond, brown rice, coconut, goat, oat and soy (soya) milk, which can be used as alternatives to cow’s milk </p>
<p> Lactose-free labeled products including sour cream, kefir, yogurt, pouring cream, and cream cheese. Dairy products labeled lactose-free have had a lactase enzyme added to them to remove the lactose. </p>
<p> Yogurt - varieties including coconut, soy milk, cashew milk, oat milk and almond milk-based yogurts. </p>
<p> Dairy free spreads including olive oil, coconut based spreads, margarine (check label) or use mashed fruits such as avocado and banana. </p>
<p> Vegan labeled products as these use dairy free and plant based ingredients. </p>
<p> Calcium and vitamin D enriched foods </p>
<p> A lactose-free or lactose-reduced diet may not contain enough calcium and vitamin D. It is beneficial to add foods rich in calcium and vitamin D to balance out the loss. Examples of these foods include: </p>
<p> tofu </p>
<p> Foods to avoid if you have lactose intolerance </p>
<p> Milk and milk products are listed on product labels in a variety of ways. These ingredients should be avoided if they exacerbate your symptoms of lactose intolerance. Always read the labels before purchasing an item. </p>
<p> Cream </p>
<p> Bottom line </p>
<p> Your symptoms will guide you as to how much lactose you can tolerate in food and drinks. A change in diet may be all that is needed to manage your symptoms. </p>
<p> To help manage lactose intolerance try: </p>
<p> Consuming small amounts of dairy products over the course of a day with or without meals </p>
<p> Introducing dairy products into your diet slowly, and adding them to baking </p>
<p> Taking lactase products before a meal or beverage to help reduce your symptoms. Lactase products contain the lactase enzyme that breaks down the lactose. They come in drops or tablet form. </p>

<p> List of Foods Goldfish Can Eat </p>

<p> Winning a goldfish as a prize at a carnival can add an unexpected member to the family without time for preparation. Luckily, the hardy fish can live in a bowl for a few days while you set up a filtered aquarium for it to thrive in the long term. You won't even need to run to the store for goldfish food because the omnivorous fish will appreciate many of the foods you probably have on hand. </p>
<p> What do goldfish eat? </p>
<p> That famous yellow tin of goldfish food provides a convenient way to feed your omnivorous fish, but your goldfish will be happier if you mix fresh foods into his diet. In the wild, goldfish munch on aquatic plants, bugs, small crustaceans, and even smaller fish. In their natural environment, goldfish can grow to 18 inches long, with adult fish feasting on frogs, newts, and other small creatures in their environment. </p>
<p> Human food for goldfish </p>
<p> It's not much trouble to prep a dinner for a goldfish that she'll find delicious. It can also rival or exceed the nutrition found in the goldfish flakes. Raid the fridge to find appropriate vegetables for goldfish: a cooked pea with the shell removed, a blanched romaine lettuce leaf, cucumber, kale, spinach, or bits of cooked vegetables. Although a high-fat, low-fiber goldfish pellet should make up the base of a proper goldfish diet, adding fresh food on a regular basis provides optimal nutrition. </p>

<p> Pet food for goldfish </p>
<p> If you keep reptiles or amphibians as pets, you might have something on hand that your goldfish will enjoy. Toss in a few fresh, frozen, or freeze-dried brine shrimp, mealworms, or crickets. Goldfish will also eat earthworms, waxworms, bloodworms, blackworms, and daphnia. These animal-based foods will give your fish added nutrition and enjoyment once you have him on a pelleted goldfish diet. Goldfish living outside in a pond where temperatures fluctuate will especially relish these natural, high-value foods. </p>
<p> Choosing a goldfish food </p>
<p> It's easy to grab a yellow can of flakes in the pet aisle of the grocery store, but that's not what's best for your goldfish. Flakes often contain fillers and start decomposing the minute they hit the water, which means all those little bits contribute to a cloudy tank you'll need to clean sooner than later. Sinking goldfish pellets can be a good option, as goldfish tend to forage through the gravel for food. They can also be easily added to an automatic fish feeder. Gel goldfish food is good for fancy goldfish that have frequent digestive issues due to modified bodies, as it prevents constipation because of its high moisture content. </p>

<p> Don't let him overeat </p>
<p> Goldfish can be appreciative eaters, consuming all that you're willing to feed them. It's in their nature to try to store fat when food is available. However, when goldfish overeat and fat forms around their organs, they easily develop swim bladder disease where they can't maintain their uprightness or depth in the water. Give your fish only enough pellets as he will eat in 30 seconds and supplement with round-the-clock access to fibrous vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, or kale. </p>
<p> Clean up after dinner </p>
<p> Any food left in the aquarium that your fish doesn't eat will start to rot and cause water quality issues. Poor water quality is the most common cause of any fish disease, so daily remove bits of fresh food or leftover pellets with a net or aquarium forceps. Follow a regular cleaning schedule, including regularly replacing one-third of the aquarium water. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Growing big and strong </p>
<p> If you're eager to see your goldfish reach maximum size, feeding her too much won't get her there. Instead, make sure your fish has plenty of room to swim and she'll grow into it. Carnival goldfish can grow up to 10 pounds and up to 2 feet long, so a 40-gallon tank for one fish, along with appropriate water quality and a diet that is carefully monitored are what it takes to reach those proportions. For a second goldfish, increase the tank size by an additional 20 gallons. Keep in mind that well cared for goldfish can live in excess of 40 years. </p>

<p> List of Foods To Avoid Before A Cholesterol Test </p>
<p> 4 min read March 2, 2019 </p>
<p> In cardiovascular risk assessment, the lipid profile also known as Cholesterol Test is a vital investigation and it has become one of the routine tests in medical checkups. The lipid profile checks the level of total cholesterol, high density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins and triglycerides. </p>
<p> High density cholesterol is known as Good Cholesterol and high levels of reference are recommended as healthy. Low density cholesterol is considered as Bad Cholesterol and patients are advised to keep it at a lower level. There are certain foods to be avoided before a cholesterol test, which are found to be causing an alteration in the cholesterol test. The test can be performed as a fasting test or a non-fasting test. Evidence suggests that the fasting lipid test will overcome the effect of elevated post-prandial triglyceride level. Patients should be provided with adequate information on foods to avoid before a cholesterol test. </p>
<p> In a fasting lipid profile, all patients should fast for 12 hours prior to the test. </p>
<p> They must avoid eating any type of solid or semisolid food during these 12 hours. But it is important to state that the patient should continue drinking water and any medication he is on. After a meal, the calories of the foods are converted to triglycerides and they remain high in the blood for a significant number of hours. The need for fasting before the test is based on this concept. </p>
<p> When discussing foods to avoid before cholesterol test, it is also important to mention about the food habits to be followed one week before the test. Having a regular diet will allow the test to show the true values of the cholesterol levels in the body. But there are some food items which can elevate the blood cholesterol levels and those should be avoided one week before the test. </p>
<p> Foods which are rich in saturated fatty acids like beef, lamb, poultry, pork, butter and milk raise the LDL cholesterol levels and lowers HDL cholesterol levels. </p>
<p> Excessive consumption of full-fat cheese, egg yolks also should be avoided before a cholesterol test because they also contain a high amount of bad cholesterol level. </p>
<p> Plant fatty foods like palm oil, coconut oil and cocoa butter also tend to increase the bad cholesterol levels. </p>
<p> Foods which contain trans-fatty acids like fast food fries, cakes, cookies and pies also can increase the cholesterol levels. Because of that, patients are advised to avoid those types of foods, if they are planning to have a cholesterol test in one week time. </p>
<p> Patients are advised not to indulge too much of sweets like desserts, chocolates before the test if they don’t normally consume them, because triglycerides are sensitive to sugar-containing food items and excess calories. </p>
<p> Foods with high carbohydrate content like foods made with wheat flour ex:-white bread, instant rise and short eats are also considered as foods to avoid before cholesterol test because they also can raise the blood triglyceride level. Triglycerides can go high up in response to high-calorie intake because the body converts calories into triglycerides and stores them in the adipose tissues. </p>
<p> Clinicians also recommend that consumption of excessive alcohol prior to the test should be avoided because it also can dramatically raise the body triglyceride levels temporarily. </p>
<p> Food is not the only factor that can affect the body cholesterol level. Recent myocardial infarction (heart attack) or stroke can lower the cholesterol levels temporarily. Surgeries or ongoing infection can also lower the total cholesterol levels for a short period of time because these conditions increase the metabolic rate of the body. Certain medications like corticosteroids and hormones like estrogen can elevate the cholesterol levels and can give rise to falsely elevated cholesterol levels. Pregnancy is also a well-known condition which gives a falsely high cholesterol level as a result of physiological increment of the body cholesterol levels during the pregnancy period. </p>
<p> Generally, it is considered that every individual who is more than 40 years of age should undergo a routine lipid profile to exclude dyslipidemia. Because this age has been identified as the most vulnerable age of developing dyslipidemia and dyslipidemia related complications such as heart attacks and strokes. </p>
<p> Knowledge on food to avoid before cholesterol test is important for the patient to identify their true cholesterol levels of the body. Because there are many types of foods which can dramatically raise blood cholesterol levels. If the clinician can identify the true value of cholesterol in the individual the cardiovascular risk can be assessed and the future management plan of risk minimization can be made accordingly. </p>

<p> A question has been bugging my mind for a few days-Is eating meat and fish explicitly forbidden in Vedas?I want to know the truth with vedic reference. </p>
<p> Meat and fish eating is not forbidden in vedas, as far as I know. – user16581 Apr 8 '19 at 16:14 </p>
<p> As per Veda, there is no restrictions. On the contrary there used to be yajna in which animal sacrifice and its meat offering was part of the process. – TheLittleNaruto♦ Apr 8 '19 at 18:49 </p>
<p> Yes, meat and fish eating is forbidden except during sacrifices, from the Chhandogya Upanishad: He who has learnt the Veda from a family of teachers, according to the sacred rule, in the leisure time left from the duties to be performed for the Guru, who, after receiving his discharge, has settled in his own house, keeping up the memory of what he has learnt by repeating it regularly in some sacred spot, who has begotten virtuous sons, and concentrated all his senses on the Self, never giving pain to any creature, except at the tîrthas (sacrifices, &c.), – Ikshvaku Apr 9 '19 at 12:00 </p>
<p> 2 Answers 2 </p>
<p> No, meat and fish eating is not explicitly forbidden in the Vedas. Complete avoidance of fish and meat is only an option. </p>
<p> He who thus knows this Yajnayajniya Saman, woven in the limbs of the body, is endowed with all the limbs of the body, and is not crippled in any limb; he reaches the full length of life, lives gloriously, becomes great with offspring and cattle and great also with fame. His holy vow is that he should not eat fish and meat for a year, or rather, he should not eat fish and meat at all. </p>

<p> so it is said that meat should be avoided but not explicitly forbidden?and can I have vedic reference – Hhh Apr 8 '19 at 16:22 </p>
<p> Chandogya Upanishad is part of the Vedas. I do not know if there is anything in the Vedic Samhitas. – Pradip Gangopadhyay Apr 8 '19 at 16:24 </p>
<p> In Geeta Sattvic,Rajasic and tamasic food has been mentioned but it is not mentioned whether meat is sattvic or not – Hhh Apr 8 '19 at 16:27 </p>
<p> Upanishads contain the highest truth of the Vedas.It is there in the Upanishad and so full proof evidence. – user17294 Apr 8 '19 at 16:28 </p>
<p> Yes, meat and fish eating is forbidden except during sacrifices, from the Chhandogya Upanishad: </p>
<p> He who has learnt the Veda from a family of teachers, according to the sacred rule, in the leisure time left from the duties to be performed for the Guru, who, after receiving his discharge, has settled in his own house, keeping up the memory of what he has learnt by repeating it regularly in some sacred spot, who has begotten virtuous sons, and concentrated all his senses on the Self, never giving pain to any creature, except at the tîrthas (sacrifices, &c.), he who behaves thus all his life, reaches the world of Brahman, and does not return, yea, he does not return. </p>

<p> This does not answer the question. – user17294 Apr 9 '19 at 12:05 </p>
<p> @Pratimaputra Why not? – Ikshvaku Apr 9 '19 at 12:06 </p>
<p> Your answer throws no light on whether its forbidden or not.One who eats the offered meat or fish does not slay the animals himself.Further, for non-trivarnas your quotation is not applicable at all. – user17294 Apr 9 '19 at 12:09 </p>

<p> Sorry Vegans: Here's How Meat-Eating Made Us Human </p>
<p> Science doesn’t give a hoot about your politics. Think global warming is a hoax or that vaccines are dangerous? Doesn’t matter, you’re wrong. </p>
<p> Something similar is true of veganism. Vegans are absolutely right when they say that a plant-based diet can be healthy, varied and exceedingly satisfying, and that—not for nothing—it spares animals from the serial torments of being part of the human food chain. All good so far. </p>
<p> But there’s veganism and then there’s Veganism—the upper case, ideological veganism, the kind that goes beyond diet and lifestyle wisdom to a sort of counterfactual crusade. For this crowd, it has become an article of faith that not only is meat-eating bad for humans, but that it’s always been bad for humans—that we were never meant to eat animal products at all, and that our teeth, facial structure and digestive systems are proof of that. </p>
<p> But sorry, it just ain’t so. As a new study in Nature makes clear, not only did processing and eating meat come naturally to humans, it’s entirely possible that without an early diet that included generous amounts of animal protein, we wouldn’t even have become human—at least not the modern, verbal, intelligent humans we are. </p>
<p> It was about 2.6 million years ago that meat first became a significant part of the pre-human diet, and if Australopithecus had had a forehead to slap it would surely have done so. Being an herbivore was easy—fruits and vegetables don’t run away, after all. But they’re also not terribly calorie-dense. A better alternative were so-called underground storage organs (USOs)—root foods like beets and yams and potatoes. They pack a bigger nutritional wallop, but they’re not terribly tasty—at least not raw—and they’re very hard to chew. According to Harvard University evolutionary biologists Katherine Zink and Daniel Lieberman, the authors of the Nature paper, proto-humans eating enough root food to stay alive would have had to go through up to 15 million “chewing cycles” a year. </p>
<p> This is where meat stepped—and ran and scurried—in to save the day. Prey that has been killed and then prepared either by slicing, pounding or flaking provides a much more calorie-rich meal with much less chewing than root foods do, boosting nutrient levels overall. (Cooking, which would have made things easier still, did not come into vogue until 500,000 years ago.) </p>
<p> In order to determine how much effort primitive humans saved by eating a diet that included processed animal protein, Zink and Lieberman recruited 24 decidedly modern humans and fed them samples of three kinds of OSU’s (jewel yams, carrots and beets) and one kind of meat (goat, raw, but screened to ensure the absence of any pathogens). Using electromyography sensors, they then measured how much energy the muscles of the head and jaw had to exert to chew and swallow the samples either whole or prepared one of the three ancient ways. </p>
<p> On average, they found that it required from 39% to 46% less force to chew and swallow processed meat than processed root foods. Slicing worked best for meat, not only making it especially easy to chew, but also reducing the size of the individual particles in any swallow, making them more digestible. For OSUs, pounding was best—a delightful fact that one day would lead to the mashed potato. Overall, Zink and Lieberman concluded, a diet that was one-third animal protein and two-thirds OSUs would have saved early humans about two million chews per year—a 13% reduction—meaning a commensurate savings in time and calorie-burning effort just to get dinner down. </p>
<p> That mattered for reasons that went beyond just giving our ancient ancestors a few extra free hours in their days. A brain is a very nutritionally demanding organ, and if you want to grow a big one, eating at least some meat will provide you far more calories with far less effort than a meatless menu will. What’s more, while animal muscle eaten straight from the carcass requires a lot of ripping and tearing—which demands big, sharp teeth and a powerful bite—once we learned to process our meat, we could do away with some of that, developing smaller teeth and a less pronounced and muscular jaw. This, in turn, may have led to other changes in the skull and neck, favoring a larger brain, better thermoregulation and more advanced speech organs. </p>
<p> “Whatever selection pressures favored these shifts,” the researchers wrote, “they would not have been possible without increased meat consumption combined with food processing technology.” </p>
<p> None of that, of course, means that increased meat consumption—or any meat consumption at all—is necessary for the proto-humans’ 21st century descendants. The modern pleasures of a grilled steak or a BLT may well be trumped by the health and environmental benefits of going vegan—and if the animals got a vote, they’d surely agree. But saying no to meat today does not mean that your genes and your history don’t continue to give it a loud and rousing yes. </p>

<p> How to Eat Meat While Caring About the Environment </p>
<p> By Nat Eliason in Health </p>
<p> Published or Updated on Sep 01, 2020 </p>
<p> There's no serious debate at this point about whether meat consumption as we've been doing it in the last ~50 years is harmful to the environment. </p>
<p> That doesn't mean eating meat is always harmful to the Earth, though. The mass-market meat production and industrialization of raising livestock is creating all kinds of problems, but can we eat meat in a way that's more sustainable and helps the environment? </p>
<p> The answer appears to be yes. Or at the very least, we can change our meat-eating behavior in a way that dramatically reduces our stress on the environment without cutting out meat entirely. </p>
<p> I've been researching this quite a bit the last few months, and I think I have some good steps anyone can take to be a "conscious carnivore." I'll go over the biggest concerns about meat's impact on the environment, what of them are the most legitimate, and how we can adjust our consumer behavior to be more environmentally conscious. </p>
<p> How Eating Meat Hurts the Environment </p>
<p> There are a number of different issues, some more accurate than others, that are levied against meat as a concern for the environment. </p>
<p> The main concerns are: </p>
<p> ‍Water use: Producing meat uses a lot of water compared to plant-based-foods.‍ </p>
<p> Land use: Grazing animals use a lot of land which we could otherwise use for growing crops, and we're clearing endangered land like rainforests to raise cattle.‍ </p>
<p> Methane production: Animals, especially cows, produce a lot of methane which is contributing to greenhouse gases and global climate change.‍ </p>
<p> Food use: We have to feed the animals that we eat, and feeding them uses up crops and food that could be used to feed humans. </p>
<p> Let's go through each one, and see where they're legitimate concerns. </p>
<p> Land Use </p>
<p> One concern is that if we didn't allocate so much land to animals, we could grow more crops. Animals use a ton of land, and if we didn't raise so many of them we could grow more food to feed the world. </p>
<p> The problem though is that 60% of agricultural land is grazing land. We can't farm on it. It's too rocky, dry, or lacks fertile enough soil for proper farming. If we removed animals, this land wouldn't be used for crops. It would be useless. </p>
<p> So how strong is the land use argument? Not very. Unless we start giving up farmable land for meat production, the land we're using is best for grazing animals anyway. </p>
<p> One legitimate concern would be feedlot or factory style farming condensing animals on farmable land instead of growing crops. That's a potential concern, but I'll cover some ways you can avoid it as a consumer later. </p>
<p> And what about the problem of rainforests being cleared in order to raise beef? This is a big problem in Brazil, so if you're Brazilian, you might want to avoid eating beef. And if you're in the US you should make sure that any beef you're eating doesn't come from Brazil too. Argentinian is better anyway. So this problem is pretty avoidable if you know where your meat is coming from. </p>
<p> Water Use </p>
<p> The stat you've probably hear some version of is that it takes anywhere from 1,200 to 1,800 gallons of water to raise one pound of beef. </p>
<p> It's a shocking statistics, but it's obscuring the truth. There are three kinds of water in agriculture: Blue Water, Green Water, and Grey Water. Borrowing some definitions from "What is a Water Footprint?": </p>
<p> Blue Water is water that has been sourced from surface or groundwater resources and is either evaporated, incorporated into a product or taken from one body of water and returned to another, or returned at a different time. </p>
<p> Green Water is water from precipitation that is stored in the root zone of the soil and evaporated, transpired or incorporated by plants. It is particularly relevant for agricultural, horticultural and forestry products. </p>
<p> Grey Water is the amount of fresh water required to assimilate pollutants to meet specific water quality standards. The grey water footprint considers point-source pollution discharged to a freshwater resource directly through a pipe or indirectly through runoff or leaching from the soil, impervious surfaces, or other diffuse sources. </p>
<p> Blue water is the precious resource we're mostly concerned with. It's not like we can drink the water stored in plants and in the soil. So if cows were drinking 1,800 gallons of blue water for each pound of beef that'd be a huge issue, but that's not what's going on. </p>
<p> Cows only get 2-8% of their water from Blue Water, the rest is Green Water that would have been there anyway. And the more grass-fed your beef is, the less blue water it uses since it's eating more natural plant matter. </p>
<p> So how much blue water does that come out to? It's about 280 gallons of blue water to make a pound of beef, though it may be as low as 50-100 for grass-fed. Which still sounds like a lot, but a food like rice takes about 66 gallons of blue water per pound. Nuts are wild: walnuts take about 339 gallons of blue water per pound, almonds are 503! </p>
<p> That's also not factoring in the food nutrients per gallon of water. A pound of beef has significantly more vitamins and nutrients than a pound of rice, not to mention all the protein. </p>
<p> So how much concern is there with water use? Well, it all depends on what else you're eating, and what kind of beef you're eating. And once again, there are some ways we can vary our consumption to make it more environmentally friendly, especially considering the stark difference between the water consumption of grass-fed beef (~2% blue water) and grain-fed (~8% blue water). </p>
<p> Methane Production </p>
<p> Now, a somewhat more legitimate concern. Methane production. This one is problematic, with some caveats. </p>
<p> Cattle raised in factory farms absolutely produce a lot of methane. But part of that is because of how they're being raised. Cattle dung in factory farmed settings is highly condensed which decreases the amount of oxygen the dung is exposed to, which leads to methane buildup. If cows are raised on more spread out pasture, their poop is less condensed which allows it to be better processed by the environment. The big difference is dung beetles, which tunnel through the cow poop exposing it to oxygen, thus reducing the methane production. </p>
<p> But even with the factory farmed methane, it's not a huge chunk of the greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA estimates that all livestock make up about 3.9 percent of all GHG emissions, and that all of agriculture makes up about 8.4% of GHG emissions. </p>
<p> And to answer a common follow-up question: yes methane is much heavier than CO2 and a more potent pollutant, however this chart uses a standardized measure called "MMT of CO2 EQ", which includes all greenhouse gasses in one standardized weight. </p>
<p> So there is some concern with the methane production, but it's a very small part of the total greenhouse gas footprint, and it can be significantly reduced by raising animals in less condensed settings. </p>
<p> Food Use </p>
<p> Okay this one definitely has some merit. If we're eating animals, those animals also need to eat things right? So if we're growing food to feed animals, it's kinda inefficient to feed those animals just to feed ourselves. </p>
<p> In the case of chicken and pork, this concern is 100% legitimate. </p>
<p> Properly raised, chickens would run around hunting small animals, worms, seeds, and have a highly varied diet of things we wouldn't eat. If you've never seen a chicken hunting a mouse, check it out. They really are little dinosaurs. </p>
<p> Pigs would eat anything you have lying around that you toss their way, including your own poop (yes, seriously). They'd eat leftover scraps, dead plants, animal carcasses, whatever you put in front of them. They're great recyclers. </p>
<p> But now, unless you're buying your chicken and pork from a small farm feeding the animals properly, they're being raised on feed from corn and other human-edible grains. So we're growing crops on land where we could grow human food, and then feeding those crops to pigs and chickens to eat them. And worse, this isn't even the food they're supposed to eat. When you go to Chipotle and they brag about how their chicken and pork are raised on a "100% vegetarian diet" that's a big warning that their animals are unhealthy. Neither chickens nor pigs are supposed to just eat plants. </p>
<p> Of all the environmental concerns around eating meat, this one seems the most legitimate. It's pretty silly to grow tons of corn just to feed it to pigs and chickens when they aren't supposed to be eating an all corn diet in the first place. The chicken and pork industry are seriously messed up, and it's exceptionally difficult to get either without contributing to a broken system that's hurting the environment, treating animals terribly, and producing a lower quality product as a result. </p>
<p> That's not necessarily as true for beef, though. </p>
<p> Chickens and pigs are monogastric. They have digestive systems fairly similar to ours where they consume something, it goes into their stomach, they digest it, and bam, energy. </p>
<p> Cows, along with Elk, Camels, Goats, Sheep, Bison, Deer, and Giraffes, are ruminants. Ruminants have a multi-chamber stomach that allows them to break down food in a completely different way than we can, which is why they can survive on just grass their entire life if they wanted. </p>
<p> The process is fascinating and a little gross. Basically they can ferment food in their stomach, puke it back into their mouth to chew it some more, then digest it again, to get more and more nutrients out of it. This is why you see cows "chewing" all the time even when they aren't eating. They just threw up some fermented food from earlier to keep working on it. Yummy. </p>
<p> The cool thing about ruminants is they can eat a ton of food you and I can't. Grain-fed cattle only get about 10% of their diet from grain that's edible to humans. The other 90% of their diet is grass and leftover crop matter that we can't eat. So unlike pork and chickens which are taking away food and cropland that could support humans, cows are clearing up plant matter that we can't eat anyway and turning it into food we can (beef). </p>
<p> And if you're fortunate enough to go hunting, or know someone who hunts, you can also eat deer, elk, and bison that are eating 100% food humans wouldn't be eating. So the food use concern is definitely warranted with chicken and pork. It's much less of a concern for beef and other ruminants. </p>
<p> Ways To Adjust Your Eating Habits to Reduce Environmental Impact </p>
<p> We've covered the main ways that eating meat can legitimately harm the environment. </p>
<p> Methane production: If you buy poorly sourced meat, especially from highly concentrated feed lots, their feces are producing a somewhat substantial amount of methane that's not great for the environment. </p>
<p> Land use and harm to farmlands: Again, if farms are concentrating animals in feed lots on land that could otherwise be used for farming, buying from them is definitely hurting our ability to grow food and potentially depriving farmland of essential nutrients. </p>
<p> Food consumption: Pork and chickens eat a ton of food that is grown for them that humans could be eating, or where we could be growing other crops that are more nutritious for us. </p>
<p> Step 1: Buy from Farms that Raise Animals Regeneratively </p>
<p> Regenerative Agriculture has been growing in popularity as a term to describe farms that are raising their animals in ways that help restore the environment instead of destroy it. </p>
<p> It's a broad term, but the idea is that through proper management of a combination of crops and animals, you can help improve the land health and sequester carbon back into the soil at a greater rate than your animals are polluting the environment. </p>
<p> The strongest evidence for the ability to do this comes from White Oak Pastures, a farm in Georgia that has been trying to raise their animals this way for 20+ years. </p>
<p> When a lifecycle analysis of their farm was done, it showed that the organic matter in the soil actually increased, and that they were offsetting at least 100% of the beef emissions as well as 85% of the farm's total carbon emissions. That included cow farts, manure emissions, farm activities, slaughter, transport, and the carbon sequestration in the soil and plants. </p>
<p> Now I will say there's one big caveat with the White Oak study. There haven't been many other studies done on the success of regenerative farming, and as Zach Bitter pointed out on the Joe Rogan Experience, this White Oak study is a little overused. It's also worth mentioning that this study was commissioned by General Mills when they bought Epic Provisions, because Epic was claiming that the meat they were buying from White Oak Pastures was supporting the environment. So General Mills's researchers had a strong interest in backing up Epic's claims to avoid any legal ramifications. I'm not saying the study is necessarily completely unreliable, but if Coca-Cola published a study on the potential health benefits of Coke I'd be a little suspicious. I really want to see more of these LCAs done to confirm how successful RegAg really is. </p>
<p> That said, White Oak is definitely raising their animals exceptionally well and you'd have a hard time finding better raised meat. So if you want to eat meat that at the very least is doing the least harm to the environment, buying from them or Force of Nature is a great way to support the environment while eating meat. </p>
<p> You can also look for local ranches that are raising their animals in more sustainable ways through a service like EatWild. Or, if you have access to a good local organic butcher, buy through them or ask them for recommendations of ranches to visit. Just be sure to double check that they're actually sourcing good meat. </p>
<p> Step 2: Eat More Beef than Chicken or Pork </p>
<p> It's pretty clear from my research that chicken and pork are harder on the environment, and harder on our food system. While it's outside the scope of this article, there's also good reason to be much more concerned about the healthiness of chicken and pork too, primarily because of what they're eating. </p>
<p> But our consumption habits have been moving away from beef and towards more chicken. This is probably because of the whole fat-free movement and fears about red meat. Again, outside the scope of this article, but based on my research those fears are very overblown and not worth acting on. Chicken are fed an awful, unnatural diet, and end up creating much less nutritious meat compared to beef as a result. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, cows are eating food that we can't eat anyway, and upcycling it into tasty burgers and steaks. If you want to eat meat that helps the environment, beef is a much better pick. </p>
<p> Step 3: Look for Other Certifications For Environmentally Friendly Food </p>
<p> This one isn't specifically related to meat consumption, but it fits with the ideas in this article so I wanted to throw it in. </p>
<p> There are a growing number of certifications you can look for on foods or suppliers that help you understand whether something you're eating is good for you and the environment. </p>
<p> One example is the Bee Better Certification. A lot of crop production, almonds for example, is awful for bee populations, but there are ways to raise these crops in a way that helps support bee populations. This is a cert those farms can get to show they're being mindful of these dying pollinators. </p>
<p> Another one would be looking for labels showing something is Glyphosate-free. This is fairly nascent now, but I suspect it will get more popular in the next 5-10 years. Glyphosate is better known as Round-Up, the weed killer used in most industrial farms that is giving people cancer. A lot of plants you buy, and foods made from plants, have some glyphosate in them and there's pretty much a 0% chance you want that in your body. </p>
<p> This is another reason why beef might be better than pork and chicken. There's not strong evidence that glyphosate gets stored by pork and chicken, but they do consume quite a lot of it, which could be harming their health. Beef, meanwhile, have been tested and there's no noticeable difference in glyphosate concentration in their meat whether or not they were fed feed with glyphosate in it. </p>
<p> Step 4: Consider Hunting or Making Friends with a Hunter </p>
<p> If you want to get to the point of eating meat with the maximum environmental benefit, consider taking up hunting. Or make friends with someone who hunts who will share some of their meat with you. </p>
<p> Most hunted meat needs to be harvested: we've driven out the natural predators to deer, elk, moose, or we have an overpopulation of invasive species like boar. Those animals can be ethically harvested and consumed, or they can die a painful death from starvation. Even if you didn't grow up hunting you can find intro to hunting trips to start learning how to do it, and you might be surprised to find it can be a really rewarding experience. </p>
<p> Obviously this would be the biggest change of anything I've listed, but I went ahead and included it since if you really want to eat meat as ethically as possible, this is the best way. </p>
<p> Eating More Environmentally Friendly Meat </p>
<p> The more consumers are willing to pay a bit more for environmentally friendly meat, the more progress we'll be able to make in that area. Factory farming is bad for the environment, yes, but that doesn't mean you have to give up meat consumption entirely. </p>
<p> Hopefully there's more research done around the potential for regenerative agriculture so we don't have to overly rely on the one White Oak study. More research in this space would give the claims around the potential for regenerative agriculture much more credit. </p>
<p> But in the meantime, finding local farms raising their meat responsibly, eating more beef than chicken and pork, and using your grocery budget to support farms and ranches trying to care about the environment more than maximum profitability is a great way to eat meat while caring about the environment. And exploring getting into hunting might not hurt either. </p>

<p> What the Buddha Said About Eating Meat </p>
<p> Ajahn Brahmavamso </p>
<p> Since the very beginning of Buddhism over 2500 years ago, Buddhist monks and nuns have depended on almsfood. They were, and still are, prohibited from growing their own food, storing their own provisions or cooking their own meals. Instead, every morning they would make their day's meal out of whatever was freely given to them by lay supporters. Whether it was rich food or coarse food, delicious or awful tasting it was to be accepted with gratitude and eaten regarding it as medicine. The Buddha laid down several rules forbidding monks from asking for the food that they liked. As a result, they would receive just the sort of meals that ordinary people ate - and that was often meat. </p>
<p> Once, a rich and influential general by the name of Siha (meaning 'Lion') went to visit the Buddha. Siha had been a famous lay supporter of the Jain monks but he was so impressed and inspired by the Teachings he heard from the Buddha that he took refuge in the Triple Gem (i.e. he became a Buddhist). General Siha then invited the Buddha, together with the large number of monks accompanying Him, to a meal at his house in the city the following morning. In preparation for the meal, Siha told one of his servants to buy some meat from the market for the feast. When the Jain monks heard of their erstwhile patron's conversion to Buddhism and the meal that he was preparing for the Buddha and the monks, they were somewhat peeved: </p>
<p> "Now at the time many Niganthas (Jain monks), waving their arms, were moaning from carriage road to carriage road, from cross road to cross road in the city: 'Today a fat beast, killed by Siha the general, is made into a meal for the recluse Gotama (the Buddha), the recluse Gotama makes use of this meat knowing that it was killed on purpose for him, that the deed was done for his sake'..." [1]. </p>
<p> Siha was making the ethical distinction between buying meat already prepared for sale and ordering a certain animal to be killed, a distinction which is not obvious to many westerners but which recurs throughout the Buddha's own teachings. Then, to clarify the position on meat eating to the monks, the Buddha said: </p>
<p> "Monks, I allow you fish and meat that are quite pure in three respects: if they are not seen, heard or suspected to have been killed on purpose for a monk. But, you should not knowingly make use of meat killed on purpose for you." [2] </p>
<p> There are many places in the Buddhist scriptures which tell of the Buddha and his monks being offered meat and eating it. One of the most interesting of these passages occurs in the introductory story to a totally unrelated rule (Nissaggiya Pacittiya 5) and the observation that the meat is purely incidental to the main theme of the story emphasizes the authenticity of the passage: </p>
<p> Uppalavanna (meaning 'she of the lotus-like complexion') was one of the two chief female disciples of the Buddha. She was ordained as a nun while still a young woman and soon became fully enlightened. As well as being an arahant (enlightened) she also possessed various psychic powers to the extent that the Buddha declared her to be foremost among all the women in this field. Once, while Uppalavanna was meditating alone in the afternoon in the 'Blind-Men's Grove', a secluded forest outside of the city of Savatthi, some thieves passed by. The thieves had just stolen a cow, butchered it and were escaping with the meat. Seeing the composed and serene nun, the chief of the thieves quickly put some of the meat in a leaf-bag and left it for her. Uppalavanna picked up the meat and resolved to give it to the Buddha. Early next morning, having had the meat prepared, she rose into the air and flew to where the Buddha was staying, in the Bamboo Grove outside of Rajagaha, over 200 kilometres as the crow (or nun?) flies! Though there is no specific mention of the Buddha actually consuming this meat, obviously a nun of such high attainments would certainly have known what the Buddha ate. </p>
<p> However there are some meats which are specifically prohibited for monks to eat: human meat, for obvious reasons; meat from elephants and horses as these were then considered royal animals; dog meat - as this was considered by ordinary people to be disgusting; and meat from snakes, lions, tigers, panthers, bears and hyenas - because one who had just eaten the flesh of such dangerous jungle animals was thought to give forth such a smell as to draw forth revenge from the same species! </p>
<p> Towards the end of the Buddha's life, his cousin Devadatta attempted to usurp the leadership of the Order of monks. In order to win support from other monks, Devadatta tried to be more strict than the Buddha and show Him up as indulgent. Devadatta proposed to the Buddha that all the monks should henceforth be vegetarians. The Buddha refused and repeated once again the regulation that he had established years before, that monks and nuns may eat fish or meat as long as it is not from an animal whose meat is specifically forbidden, and as long as they had no reason to believe that the animal was slaughtered specifically for them. </p>
<p> The Vinaya, then, is quite clear on this matter. Monks and nuns may eat meat. Even the Buddha ate meat. Unfortunately, meat eating is often seen by westerners as an indulgence on the part of the monks. Nothing could be further from the truth - I was a strict vegetarian for three years before I became a monk. In my first years as a monk in North-East Thailand, when I bravely faced many a meal of sticky rice and boiled frog (the whole body bones and all), or rubbery snails, red-ant curry or fried grasshoppers - I would have given ANYTHING to be a vegetarian again! On my first Christmas in N.E. Thailand an American came to visit the monastery a week or so before the 25th. It seemed too good to be true, he had a turkey farm and yes, he quickly understood how we lived and promised us a turkey for Christmas. He said that he would choose a nice fat one especially for us... and my heart sank. We cannot accept meat knowing it was killed especially for monks. We refused his offer. So I had to settle for part of the villager's meal - frogs again. </p>
<p> Monks may not exercise choice when it comes to food and that is much harder than being a vegetarian. Nonetheless, we may encourage vegetarianism and if our lay supporters brought only vegetarian food and no meat, well... monks may not complain either! May you take the hint and be kind to animals. </p>

<p> Meet the people who eat 10 portions of fruit and vegetables a day </p>
<p> After scientists recommended eating 800g a day to prevent early death, readers tell us how they get so much greens in their diet </p>
<p> But how do you make sure you get your 10 a day (about 800g of fruit and veg)? We asked those of you who already consume this amount. Here is a selection of responses. </p>
<p> Jenny Broomfield 27, from Oxfordshire – ‘Cook from scratch. If you do that it will allow you to pack vegetables in’ </p>
<p> It’s not a big deal at all. I started eating more greens after joining Weight Watchers. On this diet you are allowed to eat as much fruit and vegetables as you like, it’s not included in your daily points you have to eat within. That encouraged me to pack everything full of vegetables. I had 10 or more portions (if not more) a day. Now I no longer follow that plan to the letter but I have developed good eating habits that stayed with me. I have lost over four-and-a-half stone. </p>
<p> I buy a lot of vegetables and put them into what I eat. I don’t even think about it any more. For example, on Saturday night I had a pasta bake with four peppers, massive courgettes, mushrooms and onions and not much pasta. That was low calorie and five portions of vegetables all in one meal. </p>
<p> I do still eat meat but have smaller portions of it now. I snack on fruit as well, so I eat cherry tomatoes, satsumas, pineapples, that sort of thing. My advice is to cook from scratch. If you do that it will allow you to pack vegetables into every meal. Meals such as lasagnes, shepherd’s pie, curries – even pizzas – can be loaded up with delicious veg. It’s worth it because as well as the added vitamins the likelihood is you will be consuming fewer calories. Also vegetables are so much cheaper, which is incentive enough. </p>
<p> Adam Marks, 37, from Bristol – ‘Invest in a smoothie maker’ </p>
<p> I’m vegetarian, but this doesn’t mean I only eat vegetables. Most of my diet is protein-heavy stuff like Quorn, tofu and other soya products. So getting vegetables into every meal can be a struggle. But having said that, I’ve recently discovered an easy way to do it: homemade smoothies. I usually have one for my lunch using a 600ml bottle. It might not sound like much but it’s surprisingly filling. Plus, it’s an easy way to get at least five portions of fruit and veg a day. If I’m still hungry in the afternoon, I have a handful of nuts or seeds. The rest of my intake comes from other meals. I usually have an apple with my breakfast toast, and a good-sized amount of leafy greens or broccoli with dinner. </p>
<p> People forget that a “portion” of fruit and veg is not a huge amount. For example, 80g of banana is a pretty small banana. The same amount of blueberries is a little handful. You don’t have to hide the rest of your food. And best of all, it’s cheap. </p>
<p> I adopt this way of eating for health reasons mainly, and also for weight control. Eating a good amount of vegetables with a meal means you need less fatty or carbohydrate-rich foods on the same plate to feel full. My favourite smoothie includes bananas, blueberries, fresh baby spinach, cucumber, strawberries and raspberries. I mix it up with some skimmed milk. I judge the size of each portion by eye, having weighed them roughly the first time I made it. </p>
<p> It’s best to introduce vegetables gradually. Try substituting them into recipes instead of things like potatoes. You’ll feel just as full, but it’ll be way healthier. At some point it will become second nature. Oh and buy a smoothie maker. </p>
<p> Rakin Choudhury, 23, from Hull – ‘I would say prepare your meals in advance as much as you can’ </p>
<p> I am dedicated with fitness and try to prepare meals in advance, so I incorporate a lot of vegetables. I would count fruit as dessert. I started eating more healthily a couple of years ago when I left a long-term relationship. I was unhappy with my weight so I decided to change my diet and gym routine. It took a while to get the balance right as it can be expensive. It’s much cheaper if you get frozen fruit and vegetables. It’s routine now, I don’t think about it. When my office has McDonald’s Fridays I have a sandwich or porridge. It’s normal to me now. </p>
<p> To try to get more vegetables and fruit in your diet I would say prepare your meals in advance if you can. That’s what I do. I prepare all my food for the week on Sunday. Also if you are having pasta, have a salad with it. Or eat an apple with breakfast. It’s as simple as that. Another way to get enough good stuff in is by making smoothies. Ten portions a day sounds daunting but it’s not. I feel great for it. </p>
<p> Cathy, 60 from Thames Ditton – ‘My advice is don’t buy processed foods’ </p>
<p> I have always eaten a lot of fruit and vegetables. In an average day I have a banana and blueberries in my porridge, an apple or pear and nuts as a snack. Then lunch is a salad of mixed coloured lettuce, cherry tomatoes etc and either chicken breast or salmon. I will snack on an apple afterwards. Late afternoon I have some nuts and dried fruits (cranberries or maybe some strawberries in season). Then for dinner I eat meat and broccoli and carrots, or kale and carrots, followed by melon and orange cut up as a fruit salad. I make that about 10 portions. </p>
<p> My weakness is cake and chocolate so my diet is liberally sprinkled with these plus spoonfuls of peanut butter and honey. </p>
<p> I don’t believe in measuring. Fruit tends to come in convenient meal-size portions ready-made (a pear, apple, banana etc). With vegetables I just fill my plate up, it’s not rocket science. </p>
<p> If I have a bad day eating with loads of bread, cakes and sweets I feel horrible mentally and physically. I still do it though sometimes. </p>
<p> Fruit and veg are cheap so I don’t know why people don’t buy more. I’m driven by my determination to stay active and healthy well into old age. My advice is don’t buy processed foods. </p>
<p> Tamraparni Dasu, 55, from New Jersey, US – ‘The food I grew up with was centred around vegetables’ </p>
<p> My mother was a terrific cook, and coming from the Andhra region of India, we ate three- to four-course meals, each with a different type of vegetable dish. Every celebration included multiple courses. When I got married, I was introduced to a whole new cuisine, also vegetarian, from Palghat [a city in southern India]. And when none of the restaurants could match the quality of my mother and mother-in-law’s cooking, I was forced to strike out on my own and start experimenting with recipes. </p>
<p> Breakfast for me is usually chapati or toast with a leftover veggie dish, like curried cauliflower. I snack on almonds and fruit. I go a bit fruit crazy, sometimes eating an entire bunch of grapes. Lunch is usually a big bowl of fruit and vegetables in a salad and then dinner will be chapati or rice and maybe eggplant or another vegetable dish. </p>
<p> I feel healthy and energetic, and attribute my good skin and hair to eating lots of fruit and vegetables. My advice is always cook at home, buy fresh produce every week (daily is hard for most of us working shifts). We cook together as a family and friends and it makes it more fun. There are lots of resources for vegetarian cooking, which have exploded in the last decade. Variety is important so improvise from as many cuisines as possible (Italian, Chinese, Mexican, all south Asian and east Asian). Improvise and it is OK to fail, scrape off the burnt broccoli and move on. </p>
<p> Anonymous, from north Wales – ‘I add vegetables to add flavour but also to add bulk and nutrients cheaply’ </p>
<p> I get 10 portions a day. I have to work to a tight budget but also cooking is something I enjoy and take pride in. I cook our evening meals myself and while I enjoy trying out recipes I mostly cook standard stuff, such as spaghetti bolognese or stews. I add a variety of vegetables to every meal both to add flavour but also to add bulk and nutrients cheaply. </p>
<p> My spaghetti bolognese recipe, for instance, includes chopped onion, garlic, a red pepper and a tin of tomatoes. Also maybe a stick of celery, carrot or a handful of mushrooms chopped and sweated with the onion to start with. I do the same sort of thing with my stews and curries. I add in a bit of whatever vegetable I have to hand. I use my slow cooker a lot and that means the vegetable cooks down nicely to become part of a delicious sauce. A couple of sweet potatoes added to anything like that are delicious. </p>
<p> The key to getting it done is to not see it as a chore or a big thing. Just grab a glass of orange juice with breakfast. Or a cheese or ham salad sandwich with lettuce, tomato and cucumber for lunch. Then snack on a banana. Throw lots of vegetable in your dinner with apple pie to follow. There, you’ve had your 10 portions without even realising. </p>

<p> 8 Best Foods to Eat Before and After Getting the COVID Vaccine </p>
<p> Right about now, your body could use a little extra TLC in the form of good-for-you food, experts say. </p>
<p> The much-anticipated COVID-19 vaccine rollout is underway—so far, over 30 million Americans have been inoculated with at least one dose. While there are no official guidelines for what to eat before (or after) getting this vaccine, making smart and thoughtful food choices is always a good idea… and maybe now more than ever. </p>
<p> "Regardless of what vaccine you're getting, you'll want to set your health up for success by eating a clean, whole-foods-based diet," says Dr. Will Cole, leading functional-medicine expert, IFMCP, DNM, DC, and author of the upcoming book Intuitive Fasting. </p>
<p> While many people experience no side effects to the vaccine, some report mild reactions like aches, fatigue, headache, chills, and sometimes a fever. If you experience any effects, "you'll want to soothe the inflammatory immune response," explains Dr. Cole, who also authored The Inflammation Spectrum. A large portion of your immune system resides in your microbiome, so side effects or not, "focus on foods that are going to be gentler on your gut," Dr. Cole suggests. </p>
<p> Bone Broth </p>
<p> There's a reason people advise eating chicken noodle soup when you're sick—not only does it warm you up, but the broth can truly be healing. Bone broth, made with—you guessed it—beef, chicken, or turkey bones, has high levels of collagen which helps repair the lining of the gut. Plus, you don't need a soup to gain the benefits of bone broth—simply sip it like a cup of tea. </p>
<p> Green Veggies </p>
<p> We hear "eat your greens" all the time—and for good reason! Green veggies (such as spinach, kale, collards, and broccoli) all have high levels of antioxidants which help combat free radicals and fight inflammation in the body. Broccoli, for example, contains the antioxidant sulforaphane, which helps protect against oxidative stress and combats inflammation. One more note: Cooking your veggies may increase nutrient absorption and be easier on your digestion. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Garlic and Onions </p>
<p> Garlic and onions are high in prebiotics, which help feed the good bacteria in your gut. And a happy gut means a healthier you! For more prebiotic-rich foods, check out this list. (Amazingly, chocolate is one of them.) </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Soups and Stews </p>
<p> To nurture and support your immune response (which originates in your gut), Dr. Cole reminds us, you'll want to focus on healing foods like soups and stews. Better yet, make it with reparative bone broth. </p>
<p> Green Tea </p>
<p> This simple, inflammation-fighting elixir boasts high levels of the plant compound EGCG (or epigallocatechin-3-gallate), which works as a powerful antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. That damage creates inflammation, so a warm cup of tea aids your body at the cellular level. And the ritual of drinking tea can also soothe the soul. </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> Wild-Caught Salmon </p>
<p> Salmon is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which your body breaks down into resolvins and pectins—two compounds that help decrease inflammation. Unfortunately, not all salmon is created equal. These facts about farmed salmon may shock you. Luckily, wild salmon has many of the benefits (likely omega-3s) without the disadvantages that come from farmed-fish. </p>
<p> Turmeric </p>
<p> This bright orange root may be the ultimate superfood. Studies show that curcumin (the active ingredient in turmeric) not only fights inflammation but also assists brain function, protecting the hippocampus against stress."Turmeric is my go-to anti-stress food," Dr. Uma Naidoo, MD, Harvard-trained nutritional psychiatrist, professional chef, nutrition specialist and author of "This Is Your Brain on Food," told THE WELL. "I add it to smoothies, salads, soups, and even tea." A pinch of black pepper or healthy fat increases the bioavailability of curcumin. </p>
<p> 8 </p>
<p> Blueberries </p>
<p> Blueberries are another inflammation-fighting favorite of Dr. Naidoo (who didn't specifically recommend these blue jewels for post-vaccine meals). Not only are they a great source of antioxidants, but research also suggests that they can increase serotonin levels (the hormone responsible for balancing your mood). Top your unsweetened yogurt with a handful of berries and you'll have an antioxidant-packed, probiotic-rich combo! </p>
<p> 9 </p>
<p> What to Avoid: Inflammatory Foods </p>
<p> "Since vaccines amp up your immune response, you'll want to avoid any foods that you know cause an inflammatory immune response for you—including foods you may have sensitivities toward," says Dr. Cole. Some common inflammation-inducing culprits? Sugar, refined flour, vegetable oils, dairy, and artificial sweeteners—to name a few. But consider steering clear of this whole list, at least for a bit. </p>

<p> Surprising Side Effects of Eating Fish, According to Science </p>
<p> From salmon to sardines, Atlantic herring to Atlantic mackerel, there are multiple health benefits of eating fish. Packed with protein, vitamins, and minerals, fish is also a low-calorie, zero-carb food filled with polyunsaturated fatty acids, a type of healthy fat that falls under the category of essential nutrients. </p>
<p> It's no wonder fish consumption has been on the rise. According to the latest statistics from the Fisheries of the United States report, which was compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Americans enjoyed an average of 16.1 pounds of seafood per person in 2018. </p>
<p> A lower likelihood of heart disease. </p>
<p> According to an analysis of four international cohort studies that involved more than 191,000 adults from 56 countries, consuming at least two servings (175 grams or about 6 ounces) of an oily fish each week was associated with a lower risk of experiencing a major cardiovascular disease event (such as heart attack or stroke) among those who have already been diagnosed with a heart condition. </p>
<p> These findings, which were recently published on March 8, 2021 in JAMA Internal Medicine, reveal that the omega-3 fatty acids found in this type of fish can reduce a person's chances of suffering from another cardiac episode—and possibly a fatal one—by nearly 17%. </p>
<p> "Eating two servings of fatty fish per week has long been known to help improve heart health by reducing risk for strokes and sudden cardiac events," says Julie Upton, MS, RD, founding partner of the nutrition marketing and communications firm AFH Consulting. </p>
<p> She adds that the American Heart Association also recommends consuming two servings of fish each week (with one serving being 3.5 ounces), with their top choice being omega-3 rich fatty fishes, such as salmon, sardines, trout, and albacore tuna. "However, most Americans fall far short of this suggestion," she says. </p>
<p> If your wallet—or palate—does not support a few servings of fish throughout the week, she advises considering taking a supplement of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), the two types of long-chain fatty acids. </p>
<p> In fact, research published in a 2017 edition of Circulation (a scientific journal from the American Heart Association) indicates that cardiovascular disease patients may extend their lifespan by adding an omega-3 fish oil supplement to their daily regimen. </p>
<p> "This decision should be made in consultation with a physician," Upton adds. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> A boost in brain health. </p>
<p> The omega-3s found in fatty fish may also help protect your brain. A 2020 study conducted by researchers from Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York discovered that older women (with an average age of 70) who showed the highest levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood also had greater volumes of white matter in the brain (the area that's composed of millions of nerve fibers). </p>
<p> The participants who ate one to two servings of baked or broiled fish or shellfish a week had healthier brain scans. The reason? The omega-3s likely promoted an anti-inflammatory response, and in return, helped the brain fight damage caused by aging, as well as toxins found in air pollution. </p>
<p> "Eating fish as part of a healthy lifestyle may also help increase the amount of grey matter in the brain—the stuff that's associated with better memory and cognition," Blatner states. "So every time I eat fish, I like to visualize my brain getting bigger and stronger!" </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Fewer episodes of depression. </p>
<p> Once again, you are what you eat. Study authors from James Cook University in Australia analyzed the eating habits of residents from two islands—one where fast food is available and one where it's not. By screening the volunteers for depression, inquiring about their food choices, and testing their blood levels, the researchers uncovered some interesting findings, which were published in the journal Nutritional Neuroscience. </p>
<p> First, the islanders who had access to fast-food ate more processed meals while those from the other island consumed more seafood. The participants who were likely to be diagnosed with major depressive symptoms were younger and frequent fast-food eaters. And, the results from the blood tests showed that the seafood lovers had high levels of depression-fighting omega-3s. </p>
<p> "There is growing evidence to show that some people who experience depression may not have enough of the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA," says Katherine Brooking, MS, RD, founding partner of the nutrition marketing and communications firm AFH Consulting. </p>
<p> She notes that previous researchers explored the connection between omega-3s and brain health by looking at the association between people who regularly ate fish and the rates of depression. "And in countries where fish consumption is high, such as Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, rates of depression were extremely low," she adds. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Improved shut-eye. </p>
<p> Salmon and sleep may go hand-in-hand. Research published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine examined the sleep patterns of men over a five-month period who consumed Atlantic fish three times a week along with males who were instructed to eat other types of protein, such as chicken or meat. </p>
<p> At the conclusion of the study, the men in the fish group reported better sleep quality, as well as better daily functioning. The authors question the role vitamin D may have played in this outcome. </p>
<p> "Mounting evidence suggests that EPA and DHA are also important for improving sleep duration and quality of sleep," Upton says. "It appears that omega-3s can impact melatonin release, which can enhance sleep." </p>
<p> Reduced joint inflammation. </p>
<p> Adding sardines to your plate may help treat your stiff knees, suggests findings published in the journal Arthritis Care & Research. For nearly one year, 176 adults filled out a questionnaire that assessed their daily diet. The volunteers who were living with rheumatoid arthritis, and reported eating fish at least twice a week, displayed fewer symptoms (such as swollen or tender joints) compared to other volunteers with the same condition who consumed fish once a month or less. </p>
<p> "If our finding holds up in other studies, it suggests that fish consumption may lower inflammation related to rheumatoid arthritis disease activity," said lead investigator Dr. Sara Tedeschi in a press release. </p>

<p> New study finds that humans need to eat meat </p>
<p> 10 Sep New study finds that humans need to eat meat </p>
<p> Over recent years, increasing numbers of people have decided to reduce the amount of meat in their diet. Vegetarians, vegans, and pescatarians (people who eat fish but not meat) are a growing demographic, one that seeks to expand by being pests. Following any one of these meat-free diets is nothing new, but due to the spike in popularity, researchers are keen to understand the possible health implications. A recent study, which features in BMJ, looks specifically at plant-based diets and their effect on the risk of stroke and ischemic heart disease (IHD). IHD refers to any problems that occur due to a narrowing of the arteries to the heart. Without treatment, it can lead to a heart attack. Earlier studies have concluded that vegetarians have a lower risk of obesity and IHD, but as a review of relevant research explains, there is a need for more long term studies involving larger numbers of people. As for stroke risk, only a few studies have looked into the relationship between a plant-based diet and stroke risk. According to the authors of the current study, these found no significant differences in the risk of total stroke deaths between vegetarians and normal people. The latest study aimed to fill in some of these gaps. In all, the scientists took data from 48,188 people whom they followed for an average of 18.1 years. The participants, who had an average age of 45 years at the start of the study, had no history of IHD or stroke. The researchers assigned each participant to one of three groups: Meat eaters: people who reported eating meat Fish eaters: those who ate fish but no meat Vegetarians and vegans: people who did not eat meat or fish The team combined vegans with vegetarians for the main analysis due to the small number of vegans in the dataset, as well as the fact that they are functionally the same. Using food questionnaires, the researchers could also assess overall food intake and nutrient levels. Aside from dietary information, they collected information about factors such as body mass index (BMI), height, and blood pressure. During the 18.1 years of follow-up, there were 2,820 cases of IHD and 1,072 cases of stroke. After adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, the analysis revealed both positive and negative relationships between cardiovascular health and reduced meat intake. </p>
<p> The rate of IHD among pescatarians was 13% lower than that of meat-eaters, while vegetarians had a rate that was 22% lower. To put these numbers into perspective, the authors explain: This difference was equivalent to 10 fewer cases of ischemic heart disease […] in vegetarians than in meat-eaters per 1,000 population over 10 years. According to the authors, this positive association appears to be, at least partly, due to lower rates of hypertension and diabetes, as well as lower BMI and cholesterol levels. However, even after the scientists had adjusted the data to account for these factors, the effect was still marginally significant. Conversely, vegetarians had 20% higher rates of stroke than meat-eaters. This difference is equivalent to three more cases of stroke per 1,000 people over 10 years. This association was mostly due to hemorrhagic stroke rather than ischemic stroke. No previous studies have shown this type of relationship between vegetarianism and stroke risk. The authors believe that this might be because earlier work reported stroke mortality rather than incidence. Strokes are only fatal in 10–20% of cases, so many cases would not count toward the reported total. Why the scientists saw this increase in stroke risk is up for debate. The authors believe that it might be due to lower levels of other circulating nutrients in the blood of vegetarians. These might include essential amino acids and vitamins B-12 and D. The study has a number of strengths; first and foremost, the researchers used a large sample size and a long follow-up period. They also linked participants to their medical records to ensure the accurate collection of health outcomes. In addition, the researchers checked the participants' eating habits at two-time points that were years apart, finding that adherence was good overall. However, there were certain limitations. For instance, the participants self-reported their diet, which leaves room for error and misreporting. Diet can also fluctuate over days, weeks, and years. Also, researchers did not have access to the use of drugs, including statins, among participants. As the study is observational, it is not possible to conclude that the effect is causal. In other words, the changes in risk could be due to other factors that the scientists did not measure. Separately, the anti-meat troopers are out in force, advising people to ignore this data. </p>

<p> Nostril to Caudal: Can You Really Eat Fish Organs? </p>
<p> If you’ve been following this series, you know that we recently took a closer look at eating fish heads. For many North Americans, an animal’s or fish’s head is the most intimidating part to eat, followed closely by organs. </p>
<p> However, thanks to authors like Steven Rinella and Josh Niland, more and more meateaters are cooking the tongues, livers, and hearts from their kills. In fact, such recipes have become so popular it’s now common practise to pack out game organs with the rest of the meat. I believe we should apply this same open-mindedness to the fish we catch. My reasoning extends beyond responsibility and respect for the animal. Fish tend to have the cleanest of animal organs, and they’re packed with nutrients. They also happen to taste delicious! </p>
<p> The assumption that fish entrails will taste overwhelmingly “fishy” plays a major role in the common reluctance to eat the whole fish. This misconception is easily put into perspective when compared to other animals—elk livers don’t taste like elk, chicken hearts don’t taste like chicken, and fish offal doesn’t taste like fish. Organs will, however, take on a “fishy” smell if they aren’t fresh, or if they’ve come into contact with water after removal. In Part One of this series, I addressed the importance of dry handling fish offal, and I recommend reading it as a refresher before proceeding with any of the recipes below. </p>
<p> Liver A fish’s liver makes up a large part of its body weight—some even weigh as much as the filets themselves! Sydney chef Josh Niland believes fish livers are a great starting place for people who are looking to try fish offal. </p>
<p> “Even though we’ve normalised meat liver into general consumption, there’s still this fear of fish liver. I mean, there’s still fear around fish fillets—so it’s a huge hurdle for most people to wrap their head around,” Niland said. </p>
<p> Niland and his team use liver in a number of recipes, but he is exceptionally partial to using it in pâté, foie gras, and terrine. But don’t let the fancy French words hang you up; many of these are as simple as blending a few fish livers with butter and some spice—then spreading the delicious mixture on crackers or toast. </p>
<p> Heart Like livers, fish hearts are a great starting-point organ for curious chefs. Personally, I ate my first fish heart raw out of a fresh Chinook while hanging out on the dock of a fishing lodge on B.C.’s Haida Gwaii Island. I’m going to go on record and say that fish hearts should be cooked first—just as the rest of the MeatEater crew would say about their deer or elk hearts. </p>
<p> Niland emphasized that hearts are best cooked as fresh as possible. His restaurant threads them onto a skewer and then grills them over charcoal. He avoids using direct heat on any oxygenated, lean organs like hearts because “they go really tough—kind of like an overcooked chicken heart.” Make sure to keep them well away from the coals. </p>
<p> The skewer method results in a smoky, medium rare, tender chunk of meat that Niland describes as “buttery.” He and his team also salt, smoke, and grate the hearts as a smoky seasoning for vegetables, meats, and sauces. </p>
<p> Intestine I first ate cow intestine when I was in Argentina. A delicacy there, the Argentines fought for it around the table—while I fought back a dry-heave as a wad of grass brushed against my tongue. Thankfully, Niland has a delicious recipe for thoroughly cleaned fish intestines. When I asked him which intestine recipe first came to mind, he immediately answered, “Carbonara.” </p>
<p> Josh purges and rids the intestines of any contents and acids by washing then brining in a salt solution for seven days. At the end of the week, he then steams the intestines in olive oil until they’re tender, and then cuts them up to resemble penne or macaroni. He tops the “pasta” with swordfish bacon, butter, and egg yolk. If you don’t have swordfish bacon on hand, any ol’ pasta topping will do just fine. </p>
<p> “It’s pure texture and mildly fish tasting,” he described. </p>
<p> Josh said that the “pasta” method works on both fresh and saltwater fish, but that fish upwards of a kilo (two pounds or so) are ideal. He’s also adamant that fish intestines must be in excellent condition if they’re going to be used for consumption. </p>
<p> Stomach/Esophagus Niland cooks the stomach using a process similar to the intestines. He cuts the stomach out near the gills, and then purges it of any impurities by brining for a week. He washes it to remove the salt, then vacuum packs it in a bag with olive oil and steams it for to 35 minutes in an oven set to 85 degrees. From here, he chills and slices the stomach for use in a variety of recipes. </p>
<p> “Once you’ve got the stomach cooked and it’s tender and delicious and texturally wonderful, it’s literally like Pandora’s Box,” Niland said. “Tripe and onion, tripe and bacon, tripe and chorizo, there are endless possibilities once you know what you’re doing. I even made stomach rings [onion ring style] out of them the other day.” </p>
<p> It’s important to note that the stomach can contain worms and parasites, so it’s absolutely critical that the stomach is brined and examined before human consumption. </p>
<p> Air Bladder Eating air bladders is not a new concept. Historically, cod bladders were salted, boiled, and added to stews. They’re not overly strong in flavour and are slightly gelatinous in texture. In some cultures, the bladder is the most prized of the organs, with some species under threat because of illegal trading. </p>
<p> Josh and his team make a bladder chip by blanching in water or stock until the bladders soften and turn translucent. Then they lay the bladders out on parchment paper to dry. </p>
<p> “Once it’s completely dry, it should be like glass. It should be see-through,” Niland said. “From here, snap a piece of it off, drop it into really hot oil, and then fry it until it’s four times its original size and looks like a bubble.” </p>
<p> Visceral Fat I have yet to gut a fish with obvious visceral fat engulfing its organs. Niland put it in perspective for me when he explained that visceral fat is more common in farmed fish, but does occur in some well-fed wild fish. He uses the fat (known as caul fat in mammals) in place of butter. He renders and strains it through filter paper, then whisks it over ice. The result is a white fluffy butter that is perfect in desserts, sauces, and countless other recipes. </p>
<p> When I mentioned venison meatballs wrapped in caul fat, he excitedly told me of a dish they were currently serving in his restaurant: “We’ve aged a yellowfin tuna loin in a light cure and then wrapped it in bass grouper fat. We’ve trussed it and hung it up in our charcuterie cabinet.” </p>
<p> By the time I hung up the phone with Niland, my mouth was watering and my mind reeling. I instantly regretted every carcass and string of innards that I’d mindlessly tossed to seagulls over the years. I hope this installment of “Nostril to Caudal” might save you from feeling that same regret. If nothing else, I hope it’s inspired you to think a little differently about how you process your next fish. </p>
<p> Be sure to tune in next week when I cover Niland’s liver recipe! </p>

<p> How much do you feed a painted turtle? How often? Are fruits okay? This is everything you need to know about painted turtles’ diets. </p>
<p> If I had to choose just one pet turtle species as my favorite, I would probably pick the painted turtle. </p>
<p> They love to be in the water and are quite hardy and resistant to sickness and disease. Best of all though, they are amazingly beautiful creatures! </p>
<p> And although they are one of the more popular species of pet turtle in North America, a lot of people don’t know which foods to feed to them. </p>
<p> If you absolutely have no idea what to feed a painted turtle, basically it’s going to be: a protein source such as a pellet 2 to 3 times a week, a vegetable or plant 5-6 times a week and an occasional treat. </p>
<p> Let’s get into the details a little bit more, shall we? </p>
<p> What do Painted Turtles Eat? </p>
<p> You might think that painted turtles in the wild love to eat and catch fish, but the reality is far different. </p>
<p> In the wild, painted turtles’ diets are mostly comprised of insects and plants. Usually, this is either by foraging for food on the bottom of slow-moving rivers and ponds and by skimming at the water surface, eating small pieces of food and any insects that happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p>
<p> According to a study in Herpetological Review in 2000, insects were found in the flushed stomachs of 35 of 48 caught midland Painted turtles. The most commonly ingested prey were larvae, dragonflies and beetles. Both plants and animals were found in the majority of the turtles’ stomachs, although quite a few only had only animal matter. </p>
<p> When they get an opportunity, however, they will also eat crayfish and injured or dead fish. </p>
<p> Painted Turtle Diet In Captivity </p>
<p> While they munch primarily on insects and plants in the wild, their diet is drastically different in captivity. </p>
<p> In an aquarium, painted turtles are omnivores that strongly prefer eating meat. Despite this, you should limit your painted turtle’s protein consumption. A well-rounded diet based mostly on plants and vegetables, with meat or a protein-source 2 to 3 times per week is strongly recommended. </p>
<p> The following foods are quite popular as staple vegetables and plants for painted turtles: </p>
<p> Kale </p>
<p> Duckweed </p>
<p> Anacharis </p>
<p> For protein, I would recommend one of the following as your staple: </p>
<p> Omega One (learn more on Amazon) – This, in my opinion, is the overall best aquatic turtle pellets out there today. The first two ingredients are salmon and whole herring. There is no other turtle pellet out there that packs as much natural seafood as Omega One. </p>
<p> Mazuri (learn more on Amazon) – This is the stuff that most zoos use as their bulk turtle food, and there’s a good reason why. It’s just a fantastic staple food. </p>
<p> For the occasional treat, try some of these, as they are both safe and enjoyable to eat for painted turtles: </p>
<p> How Much Do You Feed A Painted Turtle? </p>
<p> Besides giving your painted turtle the correct foods, what is also almost as important is how much you feed them. </p>
<p> Essentially, the “rule” goes something like this: </p>
<p> Give your painted turtle about a handful of vegetable or plant every day to munch on. To cover your turtle’s protein and other nutritional needs, give about a heaping spoonful of turtle pellets 2 or 3 times a week. It’s also a good idea to give it a treat, such as crickets or mealworms, every week or two. </p>
<p> You don’t want to feed your painted turtle a protein source every single day. You also don’t want to feed it too much when you do feed it. This can lead to obesity (yes this happens in turtles!) and kidney problems. </p>
<p> A good rule of thumb is to give your turtle about as many pellets as the size of its head, or as many as it can eat in 10-15 minutes. </p>
<p> Don’t worry if you think it’s “not enough”. Trust me, it is! Remember, in the wild painted turtles eat mostly insects. They are getting enough nutrition from their turtle pellets. </p>
<p> Likewise, you also don’t want to go too crazy with the treats. Personally, I give my aquatic turtles either a small treat (as in a few) every week, or a bit bigger portion (about a heaping spoonful) every other week. </p>
<p> And one final point on this. It’s quite normal for an adult painted turtle to not eat anything at all for a week or 2. This often happens in the winter but it can also happen at other times in the year. If this happens to yours, don’t freak out! It doesn’t mean your turtle is sick, just that it’s taking a break from food. Make sure that it has no visible signs of illness, and carry on as normal! </p>
<p> What Do I Feed My Baby Painted Turtle? </p>
<p> For baby painted turtles, you should be feeding it the exact same foods as listed above, but with a different ratio of plant or vegetable to protein. </p>
<p> As baby painted turtles are still growing, try to give them turtle pellets every day, or at least 5 to 6 days a week. The amount should be the same, about as many as the size of its head. </p>
<p> Now, for vegetables and plants, there is a good chance that your baby painted turtle will not eat it. </p>
<p> This is very normal and expected. My advice would be to keep offering it different vegetables and plants, at least once a week. Eventually, as it grows older, it will start eating them. </p>
<p> As your baby painted turtle gets older, somewhere between 6 months to a year, you can start reducing the turtle pellet feeding days and replacing them with plants or vegetables. You’ll want to very slowly, every 6 months or so, keep doing this until you are only feeding your turtle protein 2 or 3 times a week. </p>
<p> Regardless of what you feed your turtle, it is important that you have a strong filter for your turtle tank. To learn more, check out my article on the best filter for turtle tank. </p>
<p> Can Painted Turtles Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> In general, fruits are not harmful to painted turtles, however, I recommend not feeding them these for the most part. </p>
<p> For one, painted turtles rarely if ever eat them in the wild. Now, I know you might respond by saying that they don’t eat turtle pellets either, and you’re right, they don’t. BUT, turtle pellets are designed to meet turtles’ nutritional needs. </p>
<p> There are simply better foods to offer your turtle than fruit. </p>
<p> Secondly, fruits can be difficult to offer because they don’t really float at the top of the water, and can dissolve and break up easily. </p>
<p> They can make a mess of your aquarium, and so it’s better off just avoiding them. </p>
<p> Now, if you really want to give your painted turtle some fruit as an occasional treat, go right ahead! I would just recommend cutting the pieces of really small and perhaps putting them and your turtle into a smaller feeding container. </p>
<p> Some fruits that are okay are: </p>
<p> Shredded apple pieces. </p>
<p> Cut up melon pieces. </p>
<p> Cut up berries. </p>
<p> Painted Turtle Food List </p>

<p> You are here </p>
<p> At Jewish Veg, we stand on very solid theological ground when we say that meat-eating is frowned upon by God, according to the Torah. </p>
<p> Let’s look directly at Genesis 9:3, the verse that Jews have cited countless times over the millennia to justify the eating of meat. </p>
<p> Yes, Genesis 9:3 does quote God as saying, “Every creature that lives shall be yours to eat.” </p>
<p> But when you look at the verse in its context, it is clear that God is only grudgingly giving humans this permission. </p>
<p> Consider, first of all, that the granting of this permission occurred immediately after The Flood, immediately after human beings had sunk to such a low point of immorality that God deemed it necessary to eradicate life and start over. </p>
<p> In the same chapter of Genesis, God promises to never again unleash a flood of such proportions. But, to keep that promise, a disappointed God would have to lower the standards for humankind’s behavior, to make some concessions to our baser instincts. </p>
<p> This is the context in which the permission to eat meat is granted. </p>
<p> Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of Israel during the British Mandate era, offered this interpretation of Genesis 9:3: </p>
<p> Because people had sunk to an extremely low level of spirituality, he wrote, it was necessary that they be given an elevated image of themselves as compared to animals, and that they concentrate their efforts into first improving relationships between people. If people were denied the right to eat meat, they might eat the flesh of human beings due to their inability to control their lust for flesh, according to Rav Kook. He regards the permission to slaughter animals for food as a "transitional tax" or temporary dispensation until a "brighter era" is reached when people would return to vegan diets. </p>
<p> It’s been about 3,000 years. Haven’t we reached that “brighter era”? Shouldn’t this temporary dispensation have expired long ago? </p>
<p> Chapter 9 conveys God’s dim view of meat-eating in other ways. </p>
<p> Remarkably, the permission to eat meat is accompanied by a curse. We're told in Genesis 9 that the animals, who were created to be Adam's companions, will now "fear and dread" humans. </p>
<p> With meat-eating now permitted, animals feel that humans are acting with "animosity and evil designs," in the words of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchick, one of the most prominent of the 20th Century. </p>
<p> Then there are the effects of meat-eating on longevity. </p>
<p> According to the Torah, people adhering to the vegetarian diet that is prescribed in Genesis 1:29 lived phenomenally long lives before The Flood. Genesis 5 tells us that Adam, Seth, Enosh, Kenan and Methuselah all lived past their 900th birthdays. After the permission to eat meat is granted, longevity declines precipitously. </p>
<p> Abraham, for instance, died at the relatively tender age of 175. </p>
<p> Whether you take these ages literally or not, the point is the steep decline in longevity among meat-eaters. </p>
<p> Then there’s fact that in Genesis 9 itself, God states no fewer than five times that the Divine covenant applies to animals as well as people. God does not want us to think of animals as furry or feathered vegetables. Animals are much more than that in Jewish thought. In fact, they have souls and they praise God, too. </p>
<p> Lastly, Genesis 9:3 cannot be understood apart from Leviticus 11, in which the laws of kashrut are laid out. </p>
<p> What is the overarching message of Leviticus 11? God wanted to make it difficult for us to eat meat, in hopes that we wouldn’t eat too much of it. You can only eat certain animals slaughtered under certain conditions. </p>
<p> And even then, it’s not the Torah ideal of Genesis 1:29. </p>

<p> What Is a Pescatarian and What Do They Eat? </p>
<p> A pescatarian is someone who adds fish and seafood to a vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> There are many reasons people choose to forgo meat and poultry, but still eat fish. </p>
<p> Some people choose to add fish to a vegetarian diet so they can get the health benefits of a plant-based diet plus heart-healthy fish. </p>
<p> Others might be trying to curb the environmental impact of their diet. For some, it might be simply a matter of taste. </p>
<p> This article explains more about the benefits and drawbacks of a pescatarian diet, including exactly what a pescatarian does and doesn’t eat. </p>
<p> What Is a Pescatarian? </p>
<p> Most simply, a pescatarian is someone who doesn’t eat meat, but does eat fish. </p>
<p> The term pescatarian was coined in the early 1990s and is a combination of the Italian word for fish, “pesce,” and the word “vegetarian.” Sometimes it’s spelled “pescetarian,” but this means the same thing. </p>
<p> In scientific literature, this diet is often described as “pesco-vegetarian,” and is lumped into the spectrum of vegetarianism (1). </p>
<p> By that definition, a pescatarian is someone who chooses to eat a vegetarian diet, but who also eats fish and other seafood. </p>
<p> It’s a largely plant-based diet of whole grains, nuts, legumes, produce and healthy fats, with seafood playing a key role as a main protein source. </p>
<p> Of course, just as vegetarian diets can vary widely, so can pescatarian ones. It’s possible to eat a meat-free diet that’s full of processed starches, junk food and fish sticks, rather than a healthier one based on whole foods. </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> A pescatarian is someone who follows a mostly vegetarian diet but also eats fish and seafood. </p>
<p> Why Do People Choose a Pescatarian Diet? </p>
<p> There are several reasons people may choose to eat a pescatarian diet. Here are some of the main ones. </p>
<p> Health Benefits </p>
<p> There are many proven benefits to plant-based diets, including a lower risk of obesity and chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes (2, 3, 4). </p>
<p> According to research, you can get many of those protective benefits from a pescatarian diet too. </p>
<p> One study found that women who were pescatarians gained 2.5 fewer pounds (1.1 kg) each year than women who ate meat (4). </p>
<p> And people who shifted their diet in a more plant-based direction gained the least amount of weight, showing that reducing your animal consumption may be good for you no matter your current eating patterns. </p>
<p> Another study concluded that pescatarians had a lower risk of developing diabetes at 4.8%, compared to omnivores at 7.6% (2). </p>
<p> Additionally, one large study looked at people who ate meat rarely or were pescatarians. They had a 22% lower risk of dying from heart disease compared to regular meat-eaters (3). </p>
<p> Environmental Concerns </p>
<p> Raising livestock comes with a high environmental cost. </p>
<p> According to the United Nations, raising livestock contributes to 15% of all human-made carbon emissions (5). </p>
<p> In contrast, producing fish and seafood has a lower carbon footprint than producing any type of animal meat or cheese (6). </p>
<p> A 2014 study calculated that diets of fish eaters caused 46% less greenhouse gas emissions than the diets of people who ate at least a serving of meat a day (7). </p>
<p> Ethical Reasons </p>
<p> Ethics can be a major reason why people choose to go vegetarian. It can be a major reason for pescatarians too. </p>
<p> Some of the ethical reasons people choose not to eat meat include (8, 9): </p>
<p> Opposing slaughter: They don’t want to kill animals for food. </p>
<p> Inhumane factory practices: They refuse to support factory farms that raise livestock in inhumane conditions. </p>
<p> Poor labor conditions: They refuse to support factory farms that have poor conditions for their workers. </p>
<p> Humanitarian reasons: They consider producing grain for animal feed an unjust use of land and resources when there’s so much hunger in the world. </p>
<p> Eliminating land animals from your diet addresses some of these ethical concerns. That said, aquaculture and overfishing can also be problematic. </p>
<p> Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch program is an excellent resource for finding fish that are caught or farmed in ethical ways. </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> There are several reasons people choose a pescatarian diet, including concerns about health, ethics and the environment. </p>
<p> What Do Pescatarians Eat? </p>
<p> A typical pescatarian diet is primarily vegetarian with the addition of seafood. </p>
<p> Pescatarians Do Eat </p>
<p> Whole grains and grain products </p>
<p> Legumes and their products, including beans, lentils, tofu and hummus </p>
<p> Pescatarians Don’t Eat </p>
<p> Lamb </p>
<p> A healthy pescatarian diet is largely made up of minimally processed plant foods, plus seafood and possibly dairy and eggs. </p>
<p> Benefits of Adding Fish to a Vegetarian Diet </p>
<p> There are many health benefits of adding fish to a vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> In particular, vitamins B12, zinc, calcium and protein can be somewhat harder to get on a vegan diet (11, 13). </p>
<p> Adding seafood, including fish, crustaceans and mollusks, to a vegetarian diet can provide beneficial nutrients and variety. </p>
<p> Get More Omega-3s </p>
<p> Some plant foods, including walnuts and flaxseeds, contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a type of omega-3 fat. However, this type of ALA is not easily converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the body (15, 16). </p>
<p> DHA and EPA have additional health benefits, helping not just the heart, but also brain function and mood (17). </p>
<p> In contrast, oily fish, such as salmon and sardines, contains EPA and DHA. </p>
<p> Boost Your Protein Intake </p>
<p> Humans only need about 0.8 grams of protein per 2.2 pounds (1 kg) of body weight daily to stay healthy. That’s about 54 grams for a 150-pound (68-kg) person. </p>
<p> However, many people prefer to eat more protein than that. </p>
<p> A high-protein diet can be hard to achieve with just plant proteins, especially if you don’t want extra carbs or fat with your protein. </p>
<p> Fish and other seafood offer an excellent source of lean protein. </p>
<p> Seafood Is Packed With Other Nutrients </p>
<p> Beyond omega-3s and protein, seafood is rich in several other nutrients. </p>
<p> For instance, oysters are extremely high in vitamin B12, zinc and selenium. Just one oyster delivers 133% of the RDI for vitamin B12 and 55% of the RDI for zinc and selenium (18). </p>
<p> Mussels are also super rich in vitamin B12 and selenium, as well as manganese and the rest of the B vitamins (19). </p>
<p> White fish varieties such as cod and flounder don’t deliver much omega-3 fats, but they are a source of extremely lean protein. </p>
<p> For example, just 3 ounces of cod provide 19 grams of protein and less than a gram of fat. Cod is also an excellent source of selenium and a good source of phosphorus, niacin and vitamins B6 and B12 (20). </p>
<p> You’ll Have Extra Options </p>
<p> Being a vegetarian can be limiting at times. </p>
<p> Eating out at restaurants often leaves you with a not-so-healthy choice, with dishes like cheesy pasta as the main “veggie” option. </p>
<p> If health at least partially motivates your food choices, then becoming pescatarian will give you more options. </p>
<p> And fish is generally a good one, especially if you get it baked, grilled or sautéed, as opposed to deep-fried (21). </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> Adding seafood to a vegetarian diet gives you more options and is a good way to get protein, omega-3s and other nutrients. </p>
<p> Drawbacks of the Diet </p>
<p> There are not many health drawbacks of this diet. </p>
<p> That said, some people may be more vulnerable to high intakes of fish. </p>
<p> Fish, especially larger species, can contain mercury and other toxins (22, 23). </p>
<p> For this reason, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that young children and women of childbearing age, especially pregnant and nursing women, should avoid tilefish, swordfish, shark and king mackerel (24). </p>
<p> These populations should also limit albacore and yellowfin tuna to one palm-sized serving or less per week. Light tuna is lower in mercury and it’s fine to eat 2–3 servings a week. </p>
<p> Since this diet is primarily vegetarian, it’s subject to some of the other traps that frequently accompany vegetarian diets. For instance, it can be easy to overeat carbs, especially if you rely on lots of processed grains. </p>
<p> Summary: </p>
<p> There can be some drawbacks to eating a pescatarian diet. It’s easy to overeat carbs and some fish are high in mercury. </p>
<p> The Bottom Line </p>
<p> A pescatarian diet can be quite healthy. </p>
<p> What’s more, it lets you avoid some of the ethical and environmental issues related to diets that include meat. </p>
<p> Additionally, this way of eating provides more flexibility and some additional nutrition compared to a standard vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> Overall, eating a plant-based diet with some seafood is a healthy choice. </p>

<p> Pescetarianism </p>
<p> Diet that incorporates seafood as the only source of meat in an otherwise vegetarian diet </p>
<p> Pescetarianism /ˌpɛskəˈtɛəriənɪzəm/ (sometimes spelled pescatarianism)[1] is the practice of using seafood as the only source of meat in a diet that is otherwise vegetarian.[2][3] A survey by Ipsos Mori estimates that as of 2018, 3% of humans are pescetarian.[4] </p>
<p> "Pescetarian" is a neologism formed as a portmanteau of the Italian word "pesce" ("fish") and the English word "vegetarian".[2] The term was coined in the United States c. 1990.[5][6] The English-language pronunciation of both "pescetarian" and its variant "pescatarian" is /ˌpɛskəˈtɛəriən/ with the same /sk/ sequence present in pescato (Italian: [peˈskaːto]),[7] although pesce is originally pronounced [ˈpeʃʃe] with a /ʃ/ sound. “Pesco-vegetarian” is a synonymous term that is seldom used outside of scholarly literature but it has been used in American literature since at least the mid 1980s.[8][9] </p>
<p> The first vegetarians in written western history were the Pythagoreans, a title derived from the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, creator of the Pythagorean theorem. Though Pythagoras loaned his name to the meatless diet, some suspect he may have eaten fish as well, which would have made him a not a vegetarian but a pescatarian by today's standards.[10] </p>
<p> Marcion of Sinope and his followers ate fish but no fowl or red meat.[11] Fish was seen by the Marcionites as a holier kind of food.[12] They consumed bread, fish, honey, milk, and vegetables.[11][13] </p>
<p> The "Hearers" of the ecclesiastical hierarchy of Manichæism lived on a diet of fish, grain, and vegetables.[14] Consumption of land animals was forbidden, based on the Manichaean belief that "fish, being born in and of the waters, and without any sexual connexion on the part of other fishes, are free from the taint which pollutes all animals".[15] </p>
<p> The Christian dualist Cathars sect did not eat cheese, eggs, meat, or milk because these are byproducts of sexual intercourse.[16] They believed that animals were carriers of reincarnated souls, and forbade the killing of all animal life apart from fish,[16][17] which they believed were produced by spontaneous generation.[17] </p>
<p> The Rule of Saint Benedict insisted upon total abstinence of meat from four-footed animals, except in cases of the sick.[18] Benedictine monks thus followed a diet based on vegetables, eggs, milk, butter, cheese, and fish.[19] Paul the Deacon specified that cheese, eggs, and fish were part of a monk's ordinary diet.[19] Benedictine monk Walafrid Strabo commented, "Some salt, bread, leeks, fish and wine; that is our menu."[20] </p>
<p> The Carthusians followed a strict diet that consisted of fish, cheese, eggs, and vegetables, with only bread and water on Fridays.[18] </p>
<p> In the 13th century, Cistercian monks consumed fish and eggs.[21] Ponds were created for fish farming.[21] From the early 14th century, Benedictine and Cistercian monks no longer abstained from consuming meat of four-footed animals.[21][22] In 1336, Pope Benedict XII permitted monks to eat meat four days a week outside of the fast season if it was not served in the refectory.[22] </p>
<p> Jerome recommended an ascetic diet of fish, legumes, and vegetables.[23] Peter the Hermit, a key figure during the First Crusade, was described by an eyewitness as having lived on diet of fish and wine.[24] </p>
<p> The anchorites of England ate a pescetarian diet of fish seasoned with apples and herbs, bean or pea soup and milk, butter and oil.[25][26] </p>
<p> Pescetarians, alongside vegans and vegetarians, were described as people practicing similar dietary principles as those of the Vegetarian Society in 1884.[27][28] Francis William Newman, who was President of the Vegetarian Society from 1873 to 1883, made an associate membership possible for people who were not completely vegetarian like pescetarians.[29] </p>
<p> As of 2020[update], pescetarianism has been described as a plant-based diet.[30][31] Regular fish consumption and decreased red meat consumption are recognized as dietary practices that may promote health.[3] </p>
<p> Plant foods, such as fresh produce, make up most of a pescetarian diet. </p>
<p> In 2018, Ipsos MORI reported 73% of people worldwide followed a conventional pattern diet where both meat and non-animal products were regularly consumed, with 14% considered as flexitarians, 5% vegetarians, 3% vegans, and 3% pescetarians.[4] These are similar to the results collected by GlobalData just a year earlier; where 23% of the sample had below average meat consumption, 5% had vegetarian diets, 2% had vegan diets and 3% had pescetarian diets.[32] </p>
<p> A 2018 poll of 2,000 United Kingdom adults found that 12% of adults adhered to a meat-free diet; with 2% vegan, 6–7% ovo-lacto-vegetarian, and 4% pescetarian.[33][34] In Great Britain as of January 2019, women between 18 and 24 years of age were the most likely demographic group to follow a pescetarian diet. In general, men were less interested in pescetarianism, and men 35 years and above were the least likely to adhere to a pescetarian diet pattern.[35] </p>
<p> No national surveys specifically citing pescetarianism were conducted in the 2000s. However, analysis of small national surveys sponsored by the Vegetarian Resource Group suggest that plausibly up to 2% of adults in the United States were effectively Pescetarian in 2000[36] and up to 4% were pescetarian in 2003.[37][38] The VRG polls found that not eating meat was positively associated with living in the west, living in the east, living in large cities, being a woman, and being a young adult. In 2020 YouGov published the results of 2019 research surveying 1,491 Americans. The results showed 9.75% of respondents followed some type of “meatless” diet; 2.26% reported being vegan, 4.91% reported being vegetarian and 2.58% reported being pescetarian.[39] Further analyzing revealed that in this sample being a pescetarian was positively associated with female sex, leftwing political support, diet longevity and higher education.[40] </p>
<p> Trends in pescetarianism have not been thoroughly studied in Canada; but in recent years there has been increased interest in its prevalence. A 2019 survey found that prevalences of veganism, vegetarianism and pescetarianism were 2%, 5% and 3% respectively.[41] In January 2020 a briefly conducted poll suggested up to 12.2% of adults may follow meatless diets; 4.6% self-identified as vegan, 3.2% as vegetarian and 4.4% as pescetarian. Pollster investigation did reveal limitations in the research. The data collection methods might of skewed the meatless groups higher due to; resolutioners impacting results, probable underrepresentation of older adults and allowing responses based on dietarian identity rather than dietary strictness. Nonetheless, female sex and living in Ontario or British Columbia was positively associated with pescetarianism. Male sex and living in the Prairies or the Atlantic was negatively associated.[42] </p>
<p> People may adopt a pescetarian diet out of desire to lower their dietary carbon footprint.[43][44] A 2014 lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions estimated that a pescetarian diet would provide a 45% reduction in emissions compared to an omnivorous diet.[45][46] Research on the diets of over 55,000 UK residents found that meat-eaters had dietary greenhouse gas emissions that were about 50% higher than pescetarians.[47] Similarly, a Japanese study found that various diet changes could successfully reduce the Japanese food-nitrogen footprint, particularly by adopting a pescetarian diet which may reduce the impact on nitrogen.[48] </p>
<p> Pescetarianism may be perceived as a more ethical choice because fish and other seafood may not feel pain and fear as more complex animals like mammals do,[52][53] an ongoing debate.[54][55] American surveys have found that health consciousness along with weight management remains the primary motive (39% prevalence) among non-meat eaters. The second most popular reason (29%) cited is concerns regarding agricultural animal welfare; this motivation is especially popular with younger vegetarians, vegans, and pescatarians.[40] </p>
<p> Some pescetarians may regard their diet as a transition to vegetarianism, while others may consider it an ethical compromise,[56] often as a practical necessity to obtain nutrients absent or not easily found in plants.[57] </p>
<p> Concerns have been raised about consuming some fish varieties containing toxins such as mercury and PCBs,[58] although it is possible to select fish that contain little or no mercury and moderate the consumption of mercury-containing fish.[59] </p>
<p> In both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox tradition, pescetarianism is referred to as a form of abstinence. During fast periods, Eastern Orthodox and Catholics often abstain from meat, dairy, and fish, but on holidays that occur on fast days (for example, 15 August on a Wednesday or Friday), fish is allowed, while meat and dairy remain forbidden.[60] Anthonian fasting[61] has been considered a pescetarian-like variant of Orthodox fasting as poultry and red meat are restricted throughout the year but fish, eggs, oils, dairy and wine are allowed most days.[62][63] </p>
<p> Pescetarianism (provided the fish is ruled kosher) conforms to Jewish dietary laws, as kosher fish is "pareve"—neither "milk" nor "meat". In essence, aquatic animals such as mammals like dolphins and whales are not kosher, nor are cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays, since they all have dermal denticles and not bony-fish scales.[64][65] A pescetarian diet also simplifies adherence to the Judaic separation of meat and dairy products.[66] In 2015, members of the Liberal Judaism synagogue in Manchester founded The Pescetarian Society, citing pescetarianism as originally a Jewish diet, and pescetarianism as a form of vegetarianism.[67] </p>
<p> Some Hindus by choice follow a strict lacto-vegetarian diet. However, there are Hindus who consume fish. They are from coastal south-western India.[68] This community regards seafood in general as "vegetables from the sea", and refrains from eating land-based animals. Other Hindus who consume seafood are ones from Bengal and other coastal areas.[69] In Bengal, Hindus consume fish and are known to cook it daily.[70] </p>

<p> Why Do I Have to Relieve Myself Immediately After Eating? </p>
<p> Do you ever have to rush to the bathroom after eating? Sometimes it can feel like food “goes right through you.” But does it really? </p>
<p> In short, no. </p>
<p> When you feel the need to relieve yourself right after eating, it’s not your most recent bite that sends you rushing to the toilet. </p>
<p> Digestion time varies from person to person. Your age, sex, and any health conditions you may have also affects digestion. </p>
<p> Generally, it takes about 2 to 5 days from eating for food to pass through your body as stool, estimates the Mayo Clinic. </p>
<p> However, since multiple factors are involved in the digestive process, it’s difficult to give a good estimate of digestion time. Women also tend to digest their food slower than men. </p>
<p> The entire digestive system can be up to 30 feet long in adults — much too long for food to pass right through you. What’s most likely happening to you is something called the gastrocolic reflex. </p>
<p> The gastrocolic reflex is a normal reaction the body has to eating food in varying intensities. </p>
<p> When food hits your stomach, your body releases certain hormones. These hormones tell your colon to contract to move food through your colon and out of your body. This makes room for more food. </p>
<p> The effects of this reflex can be mild, moderate, or severe. They can also vary from person to person. </p>
<p> Some people experience this reflex more frequently and more intensely than others. </p>
<p> Research has shown that certain digestive disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), speed up the movement of food through the colon after eating. </p>
<p> Certain foods and digestive disorders may trigger particularly strong or long lasting effects of gastrocolic reflex. These include: </p>
<p> When these disorders worsen your gastrocolic reflex, you’ll usually experience some other symptoms, like: </p>
<p> bloating that’s relieved or partially relieved by passing gas or having a bowel movement </p>
<p> Sometimes you might feel an urgent need to poop that isn’t related to your gastrocolic reflex. This could be the case when you have diarrhea. </p>
<p> Usually, diarrhea lasts just a few days. When it lasts for weeks, it could be a sign of an infection or digestive disorder. Common causes of diarrhea include: </p>
<p> viruses </p>
<p> bacteria and parasites, from eating contaminated food or by not properly washing your hands </p>
<p> Fecal incontinence can also cause an urgent need to poop. Those with incontinence can’t control their bowel movements. Sometimes stool leaks from the rectum with little to no warning. </p>
<p> Incontinence could range from leaking a bit of stool when passing gas to a complete loss of control over the bowels. Unlike with gastrocolic reflex, a person with incontinence might unexpectedly poop at any time, whether or not they’ve recently eaten. </p>
<p> Some common causes of incontinence include: </p>
<p> Muscle damage to the rectum. This can happen during childbirth, from chronic constipation, or from some surgeries. </p>
<p> Damage to the nerves in the rectum. It could either be the nerves that sense stool in your rectum or those that control your anal sphincter. Childbirth, straining during bowel movements, spinal cord injuries, stroke, or certain diseases like diabetes can cause this nerve damage. </p>
<p> Diarrhea. It’s harder to keep in the rectum than loose stool. </p>
<p> Damage to the rectal walls. This reduces how much stool can be retained. </p>
<p> While it’s not possible to prevent gastrocolic reflex, there are things you can do to make it easier to live with. </p>
<p> First, take note of when you experience the gastrocolic reflex and what you’ve eaten before it happens. </p>
<p> If you notice a pattern between eating certain foods and your gastrocolic reflex becoming stronger, chances are that avoiding those foods will help reduce its intensity. </p>
<p> Some common trigger foods include: </p>
<p> dairy </p>
<p> high fiber foods, like whole grains and vegetables </p>
<p> greasy and fatty foods, such as fries </p>
<p> Stress is another common trigger for gastrocolic reflex. Managing your stress can help you manage your gastrocolic reflex. Try these 16 ways to relieve stress. </p>
<p> Most people experience the effects of the gastrocolic reflex from time to time. </p>
<p> See your doctor if you experience an ongoing change in your bowel habits, or if you’re constantly running to the toilet after eating. They can figure out the underlying cause and get you the right treatment. </p>

<p> What Could Really Happen If You Eat Rodent-Infected Food? </p>
<p> On second thought, maybe skip the cheese plate tonight. Photo: Ju-Lia/Getty Images </p>
<p> The biggest restaurant story of April: rodents, specifically the rats that shut down a Dunkin’ Donuts in midtown and, of course, the lone mouse spotted at Dominique Ansel Bakery that ultimately led to a Health Department shutdown of the Cronut palace. (Not to mention that rat running around the subway car.) Anything involving rodents has an inherent ick value, but every New Yorker knows dealing with them is also part of life in the city. So we wondered: What’s the worst that could happen to you if you actually ate rodent-infected food? Sure, it’s gross, but is it truly dangerous? </p>
<p> Officially, the CDC lists seven diseases North American rats and mice transmit directly and 11 they transmit indirectly. None sounds good, and several can kill you. Theoretically, food or liquid served with any living bacterium or virus puts you at risk of catching something, and essentially the only thing New York rats won’t eat is rodent poison — worth noting: the pioneering rodentologist Martin Schein claimed scrambled eggs are a favorite food — so it’s really not like one pantry food, if rodent-accessible, is safer than another. Foodborne disease is transmitted through saliva, urine, and droppings. In the course of one day’s food rummaging, a rat can unload 50 half-inch droppings. </p>
<p> Without even including the millions of mice in NYC, some estimates say rats alone outnumber New Yorkers 2 to 1 in the city. The two rat species native to New York (Norway and black) carry things that sound like they’d appear in scenes from The Walking Dead: hemorrhagic fever, rat-bite fever, salmonellosis, leptospirosis, and listeriosis. The good news is that, while restaurant rodent infestations are uncomfortably common, outbreaks of these rodent-borne diseases are not. But the bottom line is that contamination by rodent is still a possibility in New York, even if the odds are low. From a worst-case-scenario perspective, here’s what you could get the next time you bite into a dirty doughnut: </p>
<p> Dander and hair allergies: Studies suggest a quarter of us may be allergic to rodents, and some researchers consider mice a leading cause, if not the leading cause, of asthma. For this to really mess you up, though, you’d need a bad rodent allergy and food that was absolutely covered in dander or hair. </p>
<p> Leptospirosis: You get this bacterial infection from foods or liquids splashed with rodent urine. It doesn’t matter what kind of rodent, as long as the pee stays moist on the food. Nine in ten people get rough but manageable symptoms (headaches, fever, diarrhea), making it look deceptively flulike. For one infected person in ten, though, it can cause “multiorgan failure.” </p>
<p> Rat-Bite Fever: Don’t be tricked by the name; you don’t really need to be bit. It also comes in a foodborne version called Haverhill fever, after a Massachusetts town where infected rats tainted the milk. It’s rare, but scientists have learned it’s frighteningly fatal in at-risk groups, as high as 53 percent, even. In fact, a San Diego boy died last summer after he was bitten by his pet rat Oreo. </p>
<p> Hantavirsuses: Internal bleeding is the hallmark symptom of these viruses, which are carried by rodents, but are transmissible by food and airborne contact. Doctors used to think infections couldn’t move person-to-person, but recent research shows that’s probably wrong, so (in theory) a sick rat in a trap could potentially infect an employee, who could in turn give it to customers before their appetizers even arrived. Any food is at risk if it is not stored in rodentproof containers, one of the many reasons the DOH requires storage in rodentproof containers at least six inches off the floor. </p>

<p> My girlfriend gets confused with the use of the words "ate" and "eaten". Can someone explain in simple terms how these terms work? Specifically she uses the word "ate" in sentences like this, "She hasn't ate yet" or "The kids haven't ate yet". Is this proper or should she be using the word "eaten" in this context? </p>
<p> 'Ate' is Simple Past tense. eg I ate dinner yesterday. </p>
<p> 'Eaten' is the past participle. eg I'm not hungry. I have eaten dinner. </p>
<p> But people who speak this way do not usually understand grammatical explanations. </p>
<p> You could tell her that's why we say 'I have gone' and not 'I have went', but I wouldn't be surprised if she says 'I have went' as well as 'I have ate'. </p>
<p> If you love her, maybe you just have to love the way she speaks as well.[L] </p>
<p> Oh well. At least she knows when to use the present perfect, and the 3rd person singular! </p>
<p> Actually, to really tell would be looking out for Verb Phrases. eg. has, have, had; </p>
<p> EXAMPLE : i HAVE eaten. Now when you use Past Participle,Keep that hint in mind. </p>
<p> When you say "I ate already." No has,have, had , right? & now add have after "i" and change the past in to a past participle which is "eaten" </p>

<p> Many factors affect consumer choices about meat, including price, appearance, and source information </p>
<p> Meat is an important and highly preferred human food.[2] Individuals' attitudes towards meat are of interest to consumer psychologists, to the meat industry, and to advocates of reduced meat consumption.[11][12][13] These attitudes can be affected by issues of price, health, taste, and ethics.[14][15] The perception of meat in relation to these issues affects meat consumption.[16][17] </p>
<p> Meat is traditionally a high-status food.[2] It may be associated with cultural traditions[18] and has strong positive associations in most of the world.[19] However, it sometimes has a negative image among consumers, partly due to its associations with slaughter, death, and blood.[20][21][22] Holding these associations more strongly may decrease feelings of pleasure from eating meat and increase disgust, leading to lowered meat consumption.[23][24] In the West, these effects have been found to be particularly true among young women.[25][26][27] Negative associations may only cause consumers to make meat less noticeable in their diets rather than reducing or eliminating it, for example making meat an ingredient in a more-processed dish.[28] It has been suggested that this is the result of a disconnect between individuals' roles as consumers and as citizens.[n 2] </p>
<p> Implicit attitudes towards meat have been reported to vary significantly between omnivores and vegetarians, with omnivores holding much more positive views.[29][24] Vegetarians may express either revulsion or nostalgia at the thought of eating meat.[8][n 3] </p>
<p> Consumer behavior towards meat may be modelled by distinguishing the effects of intrinsic factors (properties of the physical product itself, such as color) and extrinsic factors (everything else, including price and brand).[28] </p>
<p> Taste and texture are self-reported to be important factors in food choice, although this may not accurately reflect consumer behavior.[30] Consumers describe meat as "chewy", "tender", and "rich".[26][31] In the United Kingdom, meat is traditionally considered to taste good.[16] People experience the taste and texture of meat in significantly different ways, with variations across ages, genders, and cultures.[32] Tenderness is perhaps the most important of all factors impacting meat eating quality, with others being flavor, juiciness, and succulence.[22] </p>
<p> Visual appearance is one of the primary cues consumers use to assess meat quality at the point of sale, and to select meats. Color is one of the most important characteristics in this context.[17][22] Different cultural traditions lead consumers to prefer different colors: some countries prefer relatively dark pork overall, some light, and some have no clear preference.[33] </p>
<p> Visible fat content and marbling are also important intrinsic quality cues. Consumers as a whole tend to prefer leaner beef and pork, although significant variations exist across geographical regions. Marbling is important to some consumers but not others, and, as for fat content more generally, preference for marbling varies by region.[17] </p>
<p> Price is an important extrinsic factor which can affect consumer choices about meat.[34] Price concerns may induce consumers to choose among different meats, or avoid meat altogether.[35] </p>
<p> Health concerns are also relevant to consumer choices about meat.[36] The perceived risk of food contamination can affect consumer attitudes towards meat, as after meat-related scares such as those associated with mad cow disease or bird flu.[17][37] Safety-related product recalls can impact demand for meat.[38] People may reduce or eliminate meat from their diets for perceived health benefits.[16][32] Health considerations may motivate both meat-eaters and vegetarians.[39] Meatless diets in adolescents can be a way to conceal eating disorders, although vegetarianism does not necessarily increase the risk of disordered eating.[40] </p>
<p> Research suggests consumers tend to prefer meats whose origin lies in their own country over imported products, partly due to the fact that domestic meats are perceived to be of higher quality.[41] This effect may also reflect consumers' ethnocentrism or patriotism.[34] The importance of meat's country of origin varies from country to country.[37][42] </p>
<p> Beliefs and attitudes about environmental and animal welfare concerns can affect meat consumption.[8] Consumers in the developed world may be willing to pay slightly more for meat produced according to higher animal welfare standards, although welfare and environmental concerns are usually considered less important than attributes more directly related to meat quality, such as appearance.[28][42] A 2001 study in Scotland found that, although participants cared about animal welfare in general, they considered price and appearance more important than welfare when buying meat.[43] A study of Dutch consumers found that both rational and emotional responses to environmental and other concerns affected purchasing of organic meat.[44] </p>
<p> Meat consumption patterns can also be influenced by individuals' family, friends, and traditions.[8] A study of British eating patterns found that meat was often associated with positive food traditions, such as the Sunday roast.[18] Some consumers only purchase meat conforming with religious prescriptions, such as halal meat. These consumers' trust in quality assurance organizations, and individual relationships with meat providers, have been reported to significantly affect their purchasing behavior.[45][46] </p>
<p> One question examined in the psychology of eating meat has been termed the meat paradox: how can individuals care about animals, but also eat them?[48][49] Internal dissonance can be created if people's beliefs and emotions about animal treatment do not match their eating behavior, although it may not always be subjectively perceived as a conflict.[50][51] This apparent conflict associated with a near-universal dietary practice provides a useful case study for investigating the ways people may change their moral thinking to minimize discomfort associated with ethical conflicts.[52][53] </p>
<p> The dissonance that arises out of the meat paradox generates a negative interpersonal state, which then motivates an individual to find the means to alleviate it.[54] Recent studies in this area suggest that people can facilitate their practices of meat eating by attributing lower intelligence and capacity for suffering to meat animals, by thinking of these animals as more dissimilar to humans, by caring less about animal welfare and social inequality, and by dissociating meat products from the animals they come from.[55][56] </p>
<p> Pastured meat rabbits. Studies suggest that classifying animals as food can affect their perceived intelligence and moral standing.[57][58][59] </p>
<p> Ethical conflicts arise when eating animals if they are considered to have moral status. Perceptions of animals' moral status vary greatly, but are determined in part by perceptions of animals as having conscious minds and able to experience pain, and their perceived similarity to humans.[60][61] Some social psychologists hypothesize that meat eaters can reduce discomfort associated with the meat paradox by minimizing their perception of these morally relevant qualities in animals, particularly animals they regard as food, and several recent studies provide support for this hypothesis.[60][62] It was found, for instance, that by simply being classified within the food animals group, an animal is immediately attributed fewer moral rights.[63] </p>
<p> A 2010 study randomly assigned college students to eat beef jerky or cashews, then judge the moral importance and cognitive abilities of a variety of animals. Compared with students who were given cashews, those who ate beef jerky expressed less moral concern for animals, and assigned cows a diminished ability to have mental states that entail the capacity to experience suffering.[55][64] </p>
<p> Subsequent studies similarly found that people were more inclined to feel it was appropriate to kill animals for food when they perceived the animals as having diminished mental capacities,[65] a finding replicated in samples from the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, and India;[66] that, conversely, they perceived unfamiliar animals as having lesser mental capacities when told they were used as food;[67] and, again, that eating meat caused participants to ascribe fewer mental abilities to animals over both the short and long term.[59][60] Another study showed that rearing animals for slaughter led to less recognition of mental states in cows and sheep for those who expected to eat meat.[68] </p>
<p> A 2014 review suggested that these phenomena could be explained as a set of dissonance reduction techniques used to reduce negative emotions associated with the meat paradox, but noted that the existence of such emotions had not been demonstrated.[69] A 2016 review drew an analogy between the meat paradox and sexual objectification, writing that both practices involve strategically changing perceptions of others when thinking of them as potential "resources" (i.e., for meat or sex), and citing recent studies suggesting that sexually objectifying people prompts a reduction in their perceived humanness and moral importance.[70][71][72] </p>
<p> Several proposed strategies for resolving the meat paradox dissociate meat as a food product from the animals which produce it, or psychologically distance themselves from the processes of meat production.[73] Although concern for animal welfare has recently increased in several countries, a trend towards dissociating meat from its animal origins has tended to prevent such concerns from influencing consumer behavior.[74][75] </p>
<p> People in many cultures do not like to be reminded of the connection between animals and meat, and tend to "de-animalize" meat when necessary to reduce feelings of guilt or of disgust.[76][77][78] Meat in Western countries is often packaged and served so as to minimize its resemblance to live animals, without eyes, faces, or tails, and the market share of such products has increased in recent decades;[76][79][80] however, meat in many other cultures is sold with these body parts.[81][82] </p>
<p> Some authors have suggested that the use of non-animal words such as "sirloin" and "hamburger" for meat can reduce the salience of meat's origins in animals, and in turn reduce perceived consumption of animals.[82][83] Similarly, farmers and hunters use terms such as "processing" and "managing" rather than "killing", euphemisms which can be interpreted as a way to provide psychological distance and facilitate use of animals.[73][84] </p>
<p> The importance of dissociation processes was supported by a 2016 Norwegian study which, in a series of experiments, directly tested the effects of making live animals more salient.[85] </p>
<p> In addition to dissociation, people who experience discomfort relating to the meat paradox may simply avoid confrontation of the issue. Cultural socialization mechanisms may also discourage people from thinking of their food choices as harmful; for example, children's books and meat advertisements usually portray farm animals as leading happy lives, or even desiring to be eaten.[86] Compartmentalizing animals in different categories (such as pets, pests, predators, and food animals) may help avoid dissonance associated with differential treatment of different species.[87][88] </p>
<p> Affective factors, such as positive memories, influence meat consumption. </p>
<p> Ethical conflicts between enjoying meat and caring for animals may be made less problematic by holding positive attitudes towards meat.[1][89] People who think of meat as safe, nutritious, and sustainable tend to experience less ambivalence about eating it.[89] Religious belief in God-given dominion over animals can also justify eating meat.[90] </p>
<p> A series of studies published in 2015 asked meat-eating American and Australian undergraduates to "list three reasons why you think it is OK to eat meat." Over 90% of participants offered reasons which the researchers classified among the "four N's": </p>
<p> Appeals to societal or historical norms ("normal") </p>
<p> Appeals to nutritive or environmental necessity ("necessary") </p>
<p> Appeals to the tastiness of meat ("nice") </p>
<p> The researchers found that these justifications were effective in reducing moral tension associated with the meat paradox.[91] </p>
<p> Studies in personality trait psychology have suggested that individuals' values and attitudes affect the frequency and comfort with which they eat meat.[92][93] </p>
<p> Those who value power more highly have been found in several studies to eat more meat, while those who prefer self-transcendence values tend to eat less.[92] In particular, studies have found that the personality trait of openness to experience is negatively correlated with meat consumption, and that vegetarians and pesco-vegetarians have more open personalities.[4][94][95][96] </p>
<p> Other research has indicated that meat consumption is correlated with support for hierarchy and inequality values.[1][3][97] Those with a social dominance orientation, who more strongly support inequality and hierarchical structures, have been found in some studies to eat more meat; it has been suggested that this is consistent with their preference for having certain groups dominate others (in this case, having humans dominate animals).[98][99] In addition, research suggests people self-identifying as greater meat eaters have greater right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation.[3] Dhont & Hodson (2014) suggested that this subconsciously indicates their acceptance of cultural tradition, and their rejection of nonconformist animal rights movements.[100] Research also suggests that omnivores score higher in dark triad traits (though not at pathological levels) compared to vegetarians, though the correlations are low, as well as limited due to the small number of vegetarians/vegans available and may also largely be an artefact of gender differences in meat consumption (as males score higher in Dark Triad traits and are also more likely to eat meat; controlling for gender tends to reduce correlations to statistically insignificant levels).[101] </p>
<p> Many of these personality characteristics have been shown to relate with moral disengagement in meat consumption. In particular, individuals with higher levels of moral disengagement in meat consumption also tend to show lower levels of general empathy, experience less self-evaluative emotional reactions (i.e. guilt and shame) when considering the impact of meat consumption, endorse group-based discrimination within humans (social dominance orientation), and display power motives of dominance and support of hierarchy of humans over other species (speciesism, human supremacy beliefs). Additionally, they also tend to display higher general propensity to morally disengage, attribute less importance to moral traits in how they view themselves (moral identity), and eat meat more often.[93] </p>
<p> A detailed study of personality characteristics and diet in Americans characterized the self-descriptions of increased meat consumers as "pragmatic" and "business- and action-oriented", after correcting for gender differences.[102] </p>
<p> The idea that "you are what you eat", related to superstitions about sympathetic magic and common in many cultures, may create the perception that eating meat confers animal-like personality attributes.[103] </p>
<p> Personality correlates with both eating and avoiding meat can also vary across cultures. For example, in India, vegetarians, relative to omnivores, value their in-group more and express greater respect for authority. They are more likely to be motivated by concerns about pollution, purity and tradition. This contrasts to the United States, where vegetarians are motivated to avoid eating meat by universalism and concerns about animal welfare.[104][105] </p>
<p> In Western traditions and stereotypes, meat barbecues have a particularly strong connection with masculinity.[106] </p>
<p> In recent years, a considerable amount of social psychology research has investigated the relevance of meat consumption to perceptions of masculinity.[107] </p>
<p> The participants in a series of 2012 studies rated mammalian muscle such as steak and hamburgers as more "male" than other foods, and responded more quickly in an implicit-association test when meat words were paired with typically male names than with female names.[107][108] In a different study, perceptions of masculinity among a sample of American undergraduates were positively linked to targets' beef consumption and negatively linked to vegetarianism.[107][109] A 2011 Canadian study found that both omnivores and vegetarians perceived vegetarians as less masculine.[60][110] </p>
<p> Cultural associations between meat and masculinity are reflected in individuals' attitudes and choices.[111] Across Western societies, women eat significantly less meat than men on average and are more likely to be vegetarian.[111] Women are also more likely than men to avoid meat for ethical reasons.[111][112] A 2016 review found that male Germans eat more meat than females, linking the discrepancy to the finding that meat in Western culture has symbolic connections to strength and power, which are associated with male gender roles.[113] </p>
<p> Studies have also examined meat-eating in the context of attempts to manage others' impressions of the eater, finding that men whose masculinity had been challenged chose to eat more meat pizza instead of vegetable pizza.[114][115] These results indicate that it is possible for dietary choices to influence perceptions of the eater's masculinity or femininity, with meat strongly correlated with perceived masculinity.[116] It has been suggested that meat consumption makes men feel more masculine, but it remains unclear whether this is the case and how this may be affected by social context.[107][109] </p>
<p> In the course of human evolution, the pressures associated with obtaining meat required early hominids to cooperate in hunting, and in distributing the spoils afterwards.[117][118][119] In a 2003 paper, psychologist Matteo Marneli proposed that these pressures created the basic principles of human moral judgements: put simply, he argued, "meat made us moral."[120] </p>
<p> Several studies have found that both omnivores and vegetarians tend to consider vegetarians slightly more moral and virtuous than omnivores.[121][122] Ethical principles are often cited among reasons to stop eating meat.[123][124] Some evidence suggests meat-eaters may consider vegetarianism an implicit moral reproach, and respond defensively to vegetarian ideas. This is because people tend to regard themselves as morally good and dislike those who they regard as threatening their moral sense of self. This is due to the fact that morality is universal and its rules apply to everyone, so individuals taking action motivated by moral values are seen as implicitly indicting those who do differently (this applies even if the different moral motivations may themselves be questionable). Because vegetarians often avoid eating meat because of their moral values, meat-eaters believe them to be implicitly casting judgement upon meat-eaters' own behaviour. Meat-eaters thus respond to what they see as an implicit attack on their moral standing (while vegetarians do look down on meat-eaters somewhat, meat-eaters tend to have an exaggerated belief about the extent of this).[125][126] </p>
<p> A 2015 study found that Belgian omnivores, semi-vegetarians (flexitarians), and vegetarians have fundamentally different moral outlooks on animal welfare concerns. However, the three groups were found to donate equally to human-focused charities.[122] </p>
<p> Other research has shown how moral disengagement operates in the deactivation of moral self-regulatory processes when considering the impact of meat consumption. In particular, a 2016 study offered an interpretation of moral disengagement as a motivated reasoning process which is triggered by loss aversion and dissonance avoidance.[93] </p>
<p> Moral perspectives can have a strong influence on meat consumption, but are not uniform across cultures.[127][128] In the West, choices about meat eating are known to be associated with moral concerns about animal welfare.[89][129] In contrast, the psychology of diet in non-Western cultures has been poorly studied, even though important variations exist from region to region; for example, approximately one third of Indians are vegetarian.[127] Research has indicated that, relative to Western vegetarians, Indian vegetarians are more likely to endorse the moral values of purity, legitimate authority, and respect for ingroup and tradition.[127][128] </p>
<p> ^ Rozin (2004): "Meat should be a subject of special interest to psychologists, because it is a quintessential example of the interesting and important state of ambivalence."[5] </p>
<p> Loughnan et al. (2010): "Amongst omnivores, evaluations of meat are ambivalent, with negative attitudes partially the result of moral concerns regarding the treatment of animals."[6] </p>
<p> Graça et al. (2014): "Results indicate that although participants affirmed personal duties towards preserving the environment, promoting public health, and safeguarding animals from harm, they showed patterns that resemble moral disengagement strategies when discussing impacts associated with current meat production and consumption patterns, and the possibility of change— reconstrual of the harmful conduct; obscuring personal responsibility; disregard for the negative consequences; and active avoidance and dissociation."[7] </p>
<p> Loughnan et al. (2014): "The tension omnivores experience when reminded that their behavior may not match their beliefs and values, and the resolution of this tension by changing those beliefs, fits with the theory of cognitive dissonance."[1] </p>
<p> ^ Font-i-Furnols (2014): "Meat and meat products have an important role in many Western and non-Western countries from a social and cultural perspective, and they are a central constituent of our meals and diet despite the overall negative beliefs and attitudes toward them. According to Grunert (2006),[28] this apparent contradiction may partially be explained by the distinction between the roles of individuals as consumers and citizens: we may hold a negative attitude toward meat production and consumption as citizens, but it may be weakly displayed in our behavior as consumers."[17] </p>

<p> Why Does My Nose Run When I Eat? </p>
<p> Noses run for all sorts of reasons, including infections, allergies, and irritants. </p>
<p> The medical term for a runny or stuffy nose is rhinitis. Rhinitis is broadly defined as a combination of symptoms, including: </p>
<p> sneezing </p>
<p> congestion </p>
<p> nasal itch </p>
<p> Gustatory rhinitis is the medical term for a runny nose that’s caused by food. Certain foods, especially hot and spicy ones, are known triggers. </p>
<p> Different types of rhinitis are associated with different causes. </p>
<p> Allergic rhinitis </p>
<p> Allergic rhinitis is the most common form of rhinitis. Many people experience runny noses from allergens in the air, such as: </p>
<p> These types of allergies are often seasonal. Symptoms may come and go, but they’re generally worse during certain times of the year. </p>
<p> Many people have an allergic response to cats and dogs. During such an allergic response, the body’s immune system reacts to a substance you’ve inhaled, causing symptoms such as congestion and a runny nose. </p>
<p> It’s also possible that a food allergy is the cause of your runny nose. The symptoms of food allergies can range from mild to severe, but they typically involve more than nasal congestion. Symptoms often include: </p>
<p> Nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) </p>
<p> Nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) is the primary cause of a food-related runny nose. This type of runny nose doesn’t involve an immune system response, but instead, it’s triggered by some sort of irritant. </p>
<p> NAR isn’t as widely understood as allergic rhinitis, so it’s often misdiagnosed. </p>
<p> NAR is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means that if your doctor can’t find another reason for your runny nose, they may diagnose you with NAR. Common nonallergenic triggers of runny nose include: </p>
<p> irritating smells </p>
<p> certain foods </p>
<p> weather changes </p>
<p> cigarette smoke </p>
<p> There are several different types of nonallergic rhinitis, most of which have symptoms resembling seasonal allergies, except with less itchiness. </p>
<p> Gustatory rhinitis </p>
<p> Gustatory rhinitis is the type of nonallergic rhinitis that involves a runny nose or postnasal drip after eating. Spicy foods usually trigger gustatory rhinitis. </p>
<p> Older studies, such as a 1989 one published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, have shown that spicy foods stimulate mucus production in people with gustatory rhinitis. </p>
<p> Gustatory rhinitis is more common among older adults. It often overlaps with senile rhinitis, another type of nonallergic rhinitis. Both gustatory and senile rhinitis involve excessive, watery nasal discharge. </p>
<p> Vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) </p>
<p> The term vasomotor refers to activity related to blood vessel constriction or dilatation. Vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) presents as a runny nose or congestion. Other symptoms include: </p>
<p> These symptoms can be constant or intermittent. VMR may be triggered by commonplace irritants that don’t bother most people, such as: </p>
<p> Mixed rhinitis </p>
<p> Mixed rhinitis is when someone has both allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. It’s not uncommon for someone to experience year-round nasal symptoms, while also experiencing a worsening of symptoms during allergy season. </p>
<p> Similarly, you may experience chronic nasal congestion, but your symptoms expand to include itchiness and watery eyes in the presence of cats. </p>
<p> A runny nose isn’t a serious condition, but sometimes the symptoms of nasal congestion can become so severe that they interfere with your quality of life. At that point, it’s a good idea to talk with your doctor. </p>
<p> There are a wide variety of conditions that can cause nasal discharge, so you and your doctor will work together to investigate possible causes. </p>
<p> Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and any history of allergies. Possible diagnostic tests include: </p>
<p> If your doctor excludes all other causes for your runny nose, they’ll make a diagnosis of nonallergic rhinitis. </p>
<p> The best method for treating your runny nose will depend on the cause. Avoiding triggers and using over-the-counter (OTC) medications can help alleviate most symptoms. </p>
<p> If the cause is allergic rhinitis </p>
<p> Allergic rhinitis can be treated with many OTC allergy medications and remedies, including: </p>
<p> antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), and fexofenadine (Allegra) </p>
<p> If the cause is a food allergy </p>
<p> Food allergies can be tricky and can develop later in life. Even if your allergic symptoms have been mild in the past, they can become severe, even life threatening. </p>
<p> If you have a food allergy, try to avoid that food entirely. </p>
<p> If the cause is mixed rhinitis </p>
<p> Mixed rhinitis can be treated with medications that target inflammation and congestion, including: </p>
<p> oral decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and phenylephrine (Sudafed PE) </p>
<p> nasal decongestants, such as oxymetazoline hydrochloride (Afrin) </p>
<p> The symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis, the most common cause of food-related runny nose, can be prevented with a few lifestyle changes, such as: </p>
<p> avoiding occupational triggers (such as painting and construction) or wearing a mask while working </p>
<p> using fragrance-free soaps, laundry detergents, moisturizers, and hair products </p>
<p> Complications from a runny nose are rarely dangerous, but they can be bothersome. Below are some possible complications of chronic congestion: </p>
<p> Sinusitis. Sinusitis is an infection or inflammation of the membrane lining the sinuses. </p>
<p> Middle ear infections. Middle ear infections are caused by increased fluid and congestion. </p>
<p> Reduced quality of life. You may have trouble socializing, working, exercising, or sleeping. </p>
<p> If you need immediate relief from a runny nose, your best bet is to use a decongestant. Be sure to talk to your doctor about possible drug interactions. </p>
<p> Otherwise, your treatment for a runny nose will depend on what’s causing it. </p>
<p> If you need long-term relief, it might take a few weeks of trial and error for you to find an allergy medication that works for you. </p>
<p> It may also take time to pinpoint a specific irritant that’s triggering your symptoms, especially if it’s a common food flavoring, such as garlic. </p>

<p> Should Humans Eat Meat? [Excerpt] </p>
<p> What can and should be done about human carnivory? Vaclav Smil answers in this excerpt from his new book </p>
<p> There is no doubt that human evolution has been linked to meat in many fundamental ways. Our digestive tract is not one of obligatory herbivores; our enzymes evolved to digest meat whose consumption aided higher encephalization and better physical growth. Cooperative hunting promoted the development of language and socialization; the evolution of Old World societies was, to a significant extent, based on domestication of animals; in traditional societies, meat eating, more than the consumption of any other category of foodstuffs, has led to fascinating preferences, bans and diverse foodways; and modern Western agricultures are obviously heavily meat-oriented. In nutritional terms, the links range from satiety afforded by eating fatty megaherbivores to meat as a prestige food throughout the millennia of preindustrial history to high-quality protein supplied by mass-scale production of red meat and poultry in affluent economies. </p>
<p> But is it possible to come up with a comprehensive appraisal in order to contrast the positive effects of meat consumption with the negative consequences of meat production and to answer a simple question: are the benefits (health and otherwise) of eating meat greater than the undesirable cost, multitude of environmental burdens in particular, of producing it? </p>
<p> Killing animals and eating meat have been significant components of human evolution that had a synergistic relationship with other key attributes that have made us human, with larger brains, smaller guts, bipedalism and language. Larger brains benefited from consuming high-quality proteins in meat-containing diets, and, in turn, hunting and killing of large animals, butchering of carcasses and sharing of meat have inevitably contributed to the evolution of human intelligence in general and to the development of language and of capacities for planning, cooperation and socializing in particular. Even if the trade-off between smaller guts and larger brains has not been as strong as is claimed by the expensive-tissue hypothesis, there is no doubt that the human digestive tract has clearly evolved for omnivory, not for purely plant-based diets. And the role of scavenging, and later hunting, in the evolution of bipedalism and the mastery of endurance running cannot be underestimated, and neither can the impact of planned, coordinated hunting on non-verbal communication and the evolution of language. </p>
<p> Homo sapiens is thus a perfect example of an omnivorous species with a high degree of natural preferences for meat consumption, and only later environmental constraints (need to support relatively high densities of population by progressively more intensive versions of sedentary cropping) accompanied by cultural adaptations (meat-eating restrictions and taboos, usually embedded in religious commandments) have turned meat into a relatively rare foodstuff for majorities of populations (but not for their rulers) in traditional agricultural societies. Return to more frequent meat eating has been a key component of a worldwide dietary transition that began in Europe and North America with accelerating industrialization and urbanization during the latter half of the 19th century. In affluent economies, this transition was accomplished during the post-WW II decades, at a time when it began to unfold, often very rapidly, in modernizing countries of Asia and Latin America. </p>
<p> As a result, global meat production rose from less than 50t in 1950 to about 110t in 1975; it doubled during the next 25 years, and by 2010 it was about 275t, prorating to some 40g/capita, with the highest levels (in the US, Spain and Brazil) in excess of 100g/capita. This increased demand was met by a combination of expanded traditional meat production in mixed farming operations (above all in the EU and China), extensive conversion of tropical forests to new pastures (Brazil being the leader) and the rise of concentrated animal feeding facilities (for beef mostly in North America, for pork and chicken in all densely populated countries). </p>
<p> This, in turn, led to a rise of modern mass-scale feed industry that relies primarily on grains (mainly corn) and legumes (with soybeans dominant, fed as a meal after expressing edible oil) combined with tubers, food-processing residues and many additives to produce a variety of balanced feedstuffs containing optimal shares of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and micronutrients (and added antibiotics). But it has also led to a widespread adoption of practices that create unnatural and stressful conditions for animals and that have greatly impaired their welfare even as they raised their productivity to unprecedented levels (with broilers ready for slaughter in just six to seven weeks and pigs killed less than six months after weaning). </p>
<p> Meat is undoubtedly an environmentally expensive food. Large animals have inherently low efficiency of converting feed to muscle, and only modern broilers can be produced with less than two units of feed per unit of meat. This translates into relatively large demands for cropland (to grow concentrates and forages), water, fertilizers and other agrochemicals, and other major environmental impacts are created by gaseous emissions from livestock and its wastes; water pollution (above all nitrates) from fertilizers and manure is also a major factor in the intensifying human interference in the global nitrogen cycle. </p>
<p> Opportunities for higher efficiency can be found all along the meat production–consumption chain. Agronomic improvements – above all reduced tillage and varieties of precision cropping (including optimized irrigation) – can reduce both the overall demand for natural resources and energy inputs required for feed production while, at the same time, improving yields, reducing soil erosion, increasing biodiversity and minimizing nitrogen leakage (Merrington et al. 2002). Many improvements can lower energy used in livestock operations (Nguyen et al. 2010), reduce the specific consumption of feed (Reynolds et al. 2011) and minimize environmental impacts of large landless livestock facilities (IST 2002). Considerable energy savings can also be realized by using better slaughter and meat processing methods (Fritzson and Berntsson 2006). </p>
<p> Rational meat eating is definitely a viable option. </p>
<p> Toward Rational Meat Eating We could produce globally several hundred millions of tons of meat without ever-larger confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), without turning any herbivores into cannibalistic carnivores, without devoting large shares of arable land to monocropping that produces animal feed and without subjecting many grasslands to damaging overgrazing – and a single hamburger patty does not have to contain meat from several countries, not just from several cows. And there is definitely nothing desirable to aim for ever higher meat intakes: we could secure adequate meat supply for all of today’s humanity with production methods whose energy and feed costs and whose environmental impacts would be only a fraction of today’s consequences. </p>
<p> Meat consumption is a part of our evolutionary heritage; meat production has been a major component of modern food systems; carnivory should remain, within limits, an important component of a civilization that finally must learn how to maintain the integrity of its only biosphere. </p>
<p> The most obvious path toward more rational meat production is to improve efficiencies of many of its constituent processes and hence reduce waste and minimize many undesirable environmental impacts. As any large-scale human endeavor, meat production is accompanied by a great deal of waste and inefficiency, and while he have come close to optimizing some aspects of the modern meat industry, we have a long way to go before making the entire enterprise more acceptable. And, unlike in other forms of food production, there is an added imperative: because meat production involves breeding, confinement, feeding, transportation and killing of highly evolved living organisms able to experience pain and fear, it is also accompanied by a great deal of unnecessary suffering that should be eliminated as much as possible. </p>
<p> Opportunities to do better on all of these counts abound, and some are neither costly nor complicated: excellent examples range from preventing the stocking densities of pastured animals from surpassing grassland’s long-term carrying capacity to better designs for moving cattle around slaughterhouses without fear and panic. There is no shortage of prescriptions to increase global agricultural production with the maintenance of well-functioning biosphere or, as many of my colleagues would say, to develop sustainable food production while freezing agriculture’s environmental footprint of food (Clay 2011) – or even shrinking it dramatically (Foley et al. 2011). </p>
<p> The two key components in the category of improvements are the effort to close yield gaps due to poor management rather than to inferior environmental limitations and to maximize the efficiency with which the key resources are used in agricultural production. Claims regarding the closing of the yield gaps must be handled very carefully as there are simply too many technical, managerial, social and political obstacles in the way of replicating Iowa corn yield throughout Asia, to say nothing about most of sub-Saharan Africa, during the coming generations. Africa’s average corn yield rose by 40% between 1985 and 2010 to 2.1/ha, far behind the European mean of 6.1 and the US average of 9.6/ha, but even if it were double during the next 25 years to 4.2/ha, the continent’s continuing rapid growth would reduce it to no more than about 35% gain in per capita terms. Asian prospects for boosting the yields are better, but in many densely populated parts of that continent, such yields might be greatly reduced, even negated by the loss of arable land to continuing rapid urbanization and industrialization. </p>
<p> At the same time, there does not appear to be anything in the foreseeable future that could fundamentally change today’s practices of growing livestock for meat. Indeed, many arguments can be made that after half a century of focused breeding, accelerated maturation of animals and improvements in feed conversion, these advances have gone too far and are now detrimental to the well-being of animals and to the quality of the food chain and have raised environmental burdens of meat production to an unprecedented level that should not be tolerated in the future. And neither the expanded aquaculture nor plant-based meat imitations will claim large shares of the global market anytime soon, and cultured meat will remain (for a variety of reasons) an oddity for a long time to come. </p>
<p> Consequently, it is very unlikely that the undoubted, continuing (and possibly even slightly accelerating) positive impact of the combination of higher productivities, reduced waste, better management and alternative protein supplies would make up for additional negative impacts engendered by rising meat production and that there would be discernible net worldwide improvement: the circle of reduced environmental impacts cannot be squared solely by more efficient production. At the same time, the notion that an ideal form of food production operating with a minimal environmental impact should exclude meat – nothing less than enacting “vegetarian imperative” (Saxena 2011) on a global scale – does not make sense. </p>
<p> This is because both grasslands and croplands produce plenty of phytomass that is not digestible by humans and that would be, if not regularly harvested, simply wasted and left to decay. In addition, processing of crops to produce milled grains, plant oils and other widely consumed foodstuffs generates a large volume of by-products that make (as described in Chapter 4) perfect animal feeds. Rice milling strips typically 30% of the grain’s outermost layers, wheat milling takes away about 15%: what would we do with about 300 Mt of these grain milling residues, with roughly the same mass of protein-rich oil cakes left after extraction of oil (in most species accounts for only 20–25% of oilseed phytomass), and also with the by-products of ethanol (distillers grain) and dairy industries (whey), waste from fruit and vegetable canning (leaves, peels), and citrus rinds and pulp? </p>
<p> They would have to be incinerated, composted or simply left to rot if they were not converted to meat (or milk, eggs and aquacultured seafood). Not tapping these resources is also costly, particularly in the case of porcine omnivory that has been used for millennia as an efficient and rewarding way of organic garbage disposal. Unfortunately, in 2001, the EU regulations banned the use of pig swill for feeding, and Stuart (2009) estimated that this resulted in an economic loss of €15 billion a year even when not counting the costs of alternative food waste disposal from processors, restaurants and institutions. Moreover, the ban has increased CO2 emissions as the swill must be replaced by cultivated feed. </p>
<p> At the same time, given the widespread environmental degradation caused by overgrazing, the pasture-based production should be curtailed in order to avoid further soil and plant cover degradation. Similarly, not all crop residues that could be digested by animals can be removed from fields, and some of those that can be have other competing uses or do not make excellent feed choices, and not all food processing residues can be converted to meat. This means that a realistic quantification of meat production potential based on phytomass that does not require any cultivation of feed crops on arable land cannot be done without assumptions regarding their final uses, and it also requires choices of average feed conversion ratios. As a result, all such calculations could be only rough approximations of likely global totals, and all of my assumptions (clearly spelled out) err on a conservative side. </p>
<p> Because most of the world’s grasslands are already degraded, I will assume that the pasture-based meat production in low-income countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America should be reduced by as much as 25%, that there will be absolutely no further conversion of forests to grasslands throughout Latin America or in parts of Africa, and that (in order to minimize pasture degradation in arid regions and nitrogen losses from improved pastures in humid areas) grazing in affluent countries should be reduced by at least 10%. These measures would lower pasture-based global beef output to about 30t/year and mutton and goat meat production to about 5t. </p>
<p> Another way to calculate a minimum production derived from grasslands is to assume that as much as 25% of the total area (the most overgrazed pastures) should be taken out of production and that the remaining 2.5ha would support only an equivalent of about half a livestock unit (roughly 250g of cattle live weight) per hectare (for comparison, since 1998 the EU limits the grazing densities to 2U/ha, Brazil’s grasslands typically support 1U/ha and 0.5U is common in sub-Saharan Africa). Assuming average annual 10% off-take rate and 0.6 conversion rate from live to carcass weight, global meat production from grazing would be close to 40t/year, an excellent confirmation of the previous total derived by different means. </p>
<p> At the same time, all efforts should be made to feed available crop residues to the greatest extent possible. Where yields are low and where the cultivated land is prone to erosion, crop residues should be recycled in order to limit soil losses, retain soil moisture and enrich soil organic matter. But even with much reduced harvest ratios of modern cultivars (typically a unit of straw per unit of grain), high yields result in annual production of 4–8 of straw or corn stover per hectare, and a very large part of that phytomass could be safely removed from fields and used as ruminant feed. The annual production of crop residues (dominated by cereal straws) now amounts to roughly 3 Gt of dry phytomass. </p>
<p> Depending on crops, soils and climate, recycling should return 30–60% of all residues to soil, and not all of the remaining phytomass is available for feeding: crop residues are also used for animal bedding; for many poor rural families in low-income countries, they are the only inexpensive household fuel; and in many regions (in both rich and poor countries) farmers still prefer to burn cereal straw in the fields – this recycles mineral nutrients but it also generates air pollution. Moreover, while oat and barley straws and stalks and leaves of leguminous crops are fairly, or highly, palatable, ruminants should not be fed solely by wheat or rice straw; rice straw in particular is very high in silica (often in excess of 10%), and its overall mineral content may be as high as 17%, more than twice that of alfalfa. As a result, the best use of cereal straws in feeding is to replace a large share (30–60%) of high-quality forages. </p>
<p> These forages should be cultivated preferably as leguminous cover crops (alfalfa, clovers, vetch) in order to enhance the soil’s reserves of organic matter and nitrogen. If only 10% of the world’s arable land (or about 130ha) were planted annually with these forage crops (rotated with cereals and tubers), then even with a low yield of no more than 3/ha of dry phytomass, there would be some 420t of phytomass available for feeding, either as fresh cuttings or as silage or hay. Matching this phytomass with crop residues would be quite realistic as 420t would be only about 15% of the global residual phytomass produced in 2010. Feeding 840t of combined forage and residue phytomass would, even with a very conservative ratio of 20g of dry matter/kg of meat (carcass weight), produce at least 40t of ruminant meat. </p>
<p> Unlike in the case of crop residues, most of the food processing residues are already used for feeding, and the following approximations quantify meat production based on their conversion. Grain milling residues (dominated by rice and wheat) added up to at least 270t in 2010, and extraction of oil yielded about 310t of oil cakes. However, most of the latter total was soybean cake whose output was so large because the crop is now grown in such quantity (about 260t in 2010) primarily not to produce food (be it as whole grains, fermented products including soy sauce and bean curd, and cooking oil) but as a protein-rich feed. </p>
<p> When assuming that soybean output would match the production of the most popular oilseed grown for food (rapeseed, at about 60t/year), the worldwide output of oil cakes would be about 160t/year. After adding less important processing by-products (from sugar and tuber, and from vegetable and fruit canning and freezing industries), the total dry mass of highly nutritious residues would be about 450t/year of which some 400t would be available as animal feed. When splitting this mass between broilers and pigs, and when assuming feed : live weight conversion ratios at, respectively, 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 and carcass weights of 70% and 60% of live weight, feeding of all crop processing residues would yield about 70t of chicken meat and 40t of pork. </p>
<p> The grand total of meat production that would come from grazing practiced with greatly reduced pasture degradation (roughly 40t of beef and small ruminant meat), from feeding forages and crop residues (40t of ruminant meat) and from converting highly nutritious crop processing residues (70t chicken meat and 40t pork) would thus amount to about 190t/year. This output would require no further conversions of forests to pastures, no arable land for growing feed crops, no additional applications of fertilizers and pesticides with all the ensuing environmental problems. And it would be equal to almost exactly two-thirds of some 290t of meat produced in 2010 – but that production causes extensive overgrazing and pasture degradation, and it requires feeding of about 750t of grain and almost 200t of other feed crops cultivated on arable land predicated on large inputs of agrochemicals and energy. </p>
<p> And the gap between what I call rational production and the actual 2010 meat output could be narrowed. As I have used very conservative assumptions, every component of my broad estimate could be easily increased by 5% or even 10%. Specifically, this could be achieved by a combination of slightly higher planting of leguminous forages rotated with cereals, by treatment of straws with ammonia to increase its nutrition and palatability, by a slightly more efficient use of food processing by-products and also by elimination of some of the existing post-production meat waste. Consequently, the total of 200t/year can be taken as an unassailably realistic total of global meat output that could be achieved without any further conversion of natural ecosystems to grazing land, with conservative pasture management, and without any direct feeding of grains (corn, sorghum, barley), tubers or vegetables, that is, without any direct competition with food produced on arable land. </p>
<p> This amounts to almost 70% of the actual meat output of about 290t in the year 2010: it would not be difficult to adjust the existing system in the described ways, eliminate all cultivation of feed crops on arable land (save for the beneficial rotation with leguminous forages) and still average eating only a third less meat than we eat today. </p>
<p> A key question to ask then is how the annual total of some 200t of meat would compare with what I would term a rational consumption of meat rather than with the existing level. Making assumptions about rational levels of average per capita meat consumption is done best by considering actual meat intakes and their consequences. A slight majority of people in France, the country considered to be a paragon of classic meat-based cuisine, now eat no more than about 16g of meat a year per capita, and the average in Japan, the nation with the longest life expectancy, is now about 28g of meat (both rates are for edible weight). Consequently, I will round these two rates and take the per capita values of 15–30g/year as the range of rational meat consumption. For seven billion people in 2012, this would translate to between 105 and 210 Mt/year – or, assuming 20/30/50 beef/pork/chicken shares, between 140 and 280 Mt in carcass weight. The latter total is almost equal to the actual global meat output in 2010, with the obvious difference being that the consumption of today’s output is very unevenly distributed. </p>
<p> If we could produce 200t/year without any competition with food crops, then the next step is to inquire how much concentrate feed we would need to grow if we were to equal current output of roughly 300t with the lowest possible environmental impact. Assuming that the additional 100t meat a year would come from a combination of 10t of beef fed from expanded cultivation of leguminous forages, 10t of herbivorous fish (conversion ratio 1 : 1) and 80t of chicken meat (conversion ratio 2 : 1), its output would require about 170t of concentrate feed, that is, less than a fifth of all feed now produced on arable land. Moreover, a significant share of this feed could come from extensive (low-yield and hence low-impact) cultivation of corn and soybeans on currently idle farmland. </p>
<p> Roques et al. (2011) estimated that in 2007 there were 19–48 Mha of idle land (an equivalent of 1.3–3.3% of the world’s arable area), that is, land cultivated previously that can be planted again, most of it in North America and Asia. Using 20ha of this land would produce at least an additional 60t of feed. And when factoring in increasing crop yields, regular rotations with leguminous forages (producing excellent ruminant feed while reducing inputs of nitrogen fertilizers) and, eventually, slightly higher feed conversion efficiencies, it is realistic to expect that the share of the existing farmland used to grow feed crops could be reduced from the current share of about 33% to less than 10% of the total. Consequently, there is no doubt that we could match recent global meat output of about 300t meat a year without overgrazing, with realistically estimated feeding of residues and by-products, and with only a small claim on arable land, a combination that would greatly limit livestock’s environmental impact. </p>
<p> Prospects for Change Many years ago, I decided not to speculate about the course and intensity of any truly long-term developments: all that is needed to show a near-complete futility of these efforts is to look back and see to what extent would have any forecast made in 1985 captured the realities of 2010 – and that would be looking just a single generation ahead, while forecasts looking half a century into the future are now quite common. Forecasting demand for meat – a commodity whose production depends on so many environmental, technical and economic variables and whose future level of consumption will be, as in the past, determined by a complex interaction of population and economic growth, disposable income, cultural preferences, social norms and health concerns – thus amounts to a guessing game with a fairly wide range of outcomes. </p>
<p> But FAO’s latest long-range forecast gives just single global values (accurate to 1t) not just for 2030 (374t) but also for 2050 (455t) and 2080 (524t). Compared to 2010, the demand in 2030 would be nearly 30%, and in 2050 about 55% higher. When subdivided between developing and developed countries, the forecast has the latter group producing in 2080 only a third as much as the former. These estimates imply slow but continuing growth of average per capita meat consumption in affluent countries (more than 20% higher in 2080 than in 2007) and 70% higher per capita meat supply in the rest of the world. </p>
<p> Standard assumptions driving these kinds of forecasts are obvious: either a slow growth or stagnation and decline of affluent population accompanied by a slow increase of average incomes; continuing, albeit slowing, population growth in modernizing countries where progressing urbanization will create not only many new large cities but also megacities, conurbations with more than 20 or 30 million people, and boost average disposable incomes of billions of people; advancing technical improvements that will keep in check the relative cost of essential agricultural inputs (fertilizers, other agrochemicals, field machinery) and that will keep reducing environmental impacts; and all of this powered by a continuing supply of readily available fuels and electricity whose cost per unit of final demand will not depart dramatically from the long-term trend. </p>
<p> Standard assumptions also imply continuation and intensification of existing practices ranging from large-scale cultivation of feed crops on arable land (with all associated environmental burdens) to further worldwide diffusion of massive centralized animal feeding operations for pork and poultry. Undoubtedly, more measures will be taken to improve the lot of mammals and birds in CAFOs. Many of them will be given a bit more space, their feed will not contain some questionable ingredients, an increasing share of them will be dosed less with unnecessary antibiotics and their wastes will be better treated. Some of these changes will be driven by animal welfare considerations, others by public health concerns, new environmental regulations and basic economic realities; all of them will be incremental and uneven. And while they might be cumulatively important, it is unlikely that their aggregate positive impact will be greater than the additional negative impact created by substantial increases in the expected demand for meat: by 2030 or 2050, our carnivory could thus well exact an even higher environmental price than today. </p>
<p> I would strongly argue that there is absolutely no need for higher meat supply in any affluent economy, and I do not think that improved nutrition, better health and increased longevity in the rest of the world is predicated on nearly doubling meat supply in today’s developing countries. Global output of as little as 140t/year (carcass weight) would guarantee minimum intakes compatible with good health, and production on the order of 200t of meat a year could be achieved without claiming any additional grazing or arable land and with water and nutrient inputs no higher than those currently used for growing just food crops. </p>
<p> And it could also be done in a manner that would actually improve soil quality and diversify farming income. Moreover, an additional 100t/year could be produced by using less than a fifth of the existing harvest of concentrate feeds, and it could come from less than a tenth of the farmland that is now under cultivation and that could be used to grow food crops. Even for a global population of eight billion, the output of 300t/year would prorate to nearly 40g of meat a year/capita, or well above 50g a year for adults. This means that the average for the most frequent meat eaters, adolescent and adult men, could be 55g/year, and the mean for women, children and people over 60 would be between 25 and 30g/year, rates that are far above the minima needed for adequate nutrition and even above the optima correlated with desirable health indicators (low obesity rates, low CVD mortality) and with record nationwide longevities. </p>
<p> Global inequalities of all kinds are not going to be eliminated in a generation or two, and hence a realistic goal is not any rapid converging toward an egalitarian consumption mean: that mean would require significant consumption cuts in some of the richest countries (halving today’s average per capita supply) and some substantial increases in the poorest ones (doubling today’s per capita availability). What is desirable and what should be pursued by all possible means is a gradual convergence toward that egalitarian mean combined with continuing efficiency improvements and with practical displacement of some meat consumption by environmentally less demanding animal foodstuffs. </p>
<p> Such a process would be benefiting everybody by improving health and life expectancies of both affluent and low-income populations and by reducing the environmental burdens of meat production. Although the two opposite consumption trends of this great transition have been evident during the past generation, a much less uneven distribution of meat supply could come about only as a result of complex adjustments that will take decades to unfold. In the absence of dietary taboos, average meat intakes can rise fast as disposable incomes go up; in contrast, food preferences are among the most inertial of all behavioral traits and (except as result of a sudden economic hardship) consumption cuts of a similar rapidity are much less likely. </p>
<p> At the same time, modern dietary transition has modified eating habits of most of the humanity in what have been, in historic terms, relative short spans of time, in some cases as brief as a single generation. These dietary changes have been just a part of the general post-WW II shift toward greater affluence, and the two generations of these (only mildly interrupted) gains have created a habit of powerful anticipations of further gains. That may not be the case during the coming two generations because several concatenated trends are creating a world that will be appreciably different from that whose apogee was reached during the last decade of the 20th century. </p>
<p> Aging of Western population and, in many cases, their absolute decline appear to be irreversible processes: fertilities have fallen too far to recover above the replacement level, marriage rates are falling, first births are being postponed while the cost of raising a family in modern cities has risen considerably. By 2050, roughly two out of five Japanese, Spaniards and Germans will be above 60 years of age; even in China that share will be one-third (compared to just 12% in 2010!), and, together with many smaller countries, Germany, Japan and Russia will have millions (even tens of millions) fewer people than they have today. </p>
<p> We have yet to understand the complex impacts of these fundamental realities, but (judging by the German, Japanese and even Chinese experiences) continuing rise in meat demand will not be one of them. And while the American population will continue to grow, the country’s extraordinarily high rate of overweight and obesity, accompanied by a no less extraordinary waste of food, offer a perfect justification for greatly reduced meat consumption. Beef consumption is already in long-term decline, and the easiest way to achieve gradual lowering of America’s overall per capita meat intakes would not be by appealing to environmental consciousness (or by pointing out exaggerated threats to health) but by paying a price that more accurately reflects meat’s claim on energy, soils, water and the atmosphere. </p>
<p> Meat, of course, is not unique as we do not pay directly for the real cost of any foodstuff we consume or any form of energy that powers the modern civilizations or raw material that makes its complex infrastructures. Meat has become more affordable not only because of the rising productivity of the livestock sector but also because much less has been spent on other foodstuffs. This post-WW II spending shift has been pronounced even in the US where food was already abundant and relatively inexpensive: food expenditures took more than 40% of an average household’s disposable income in 1900; by 1950, the share was about 21%; it fell below 15% in 1966 and below 10% (9.9%) in the year 2000; in 2010, it was 9.4%, with just 5.5% spent on food consumed at home and 3.9% on food eaten away from home (USDA 2012b). The total expenditure was slightly less than spending on recreation and much less than spending on health care. At the same time, the share of overall food and drink spending received by farmers shrank from 14% in 1967 to 5% in 2007, while the share going to restaurants rose from 8% to 14%. </p>
<p> These trends cannot continue, and their arrest and a partial reversal should be a part of the affluent world’s broader return to rational spending after decades of living beyond its means. Unfortunately, such adjustments may not be gradual: while the FAO food price index stayed fairly steady between 1990 and 2005, the post-2008 spike lifted it to more than double the 2002–2004 mean, and it led to renewed concerns about future food supply and about the chances of recurring, and even higher, price spikes. Increased food prices in affluent countries would undoubtedly reduce the overall meat consumption, but their effect on food security on low-income nations is much less clear. For decades, low international food prices were seen as a major reason for continuing insecurity of their food supply (making it impossible for small-scale farmers to compete), but that conclusion was swiftly reversed with the post-2007 rapid rise of commodity prices that came to be seen as a major factor pushing people into hunger and poverty (Swinnen and Squicciarini 2012). </p>
<p> In any case, it is most unlikely that food prices in populous nations of Asia and Africa will decline to levels now prevailing in the West: China’s share of food spending is still 25% of disposable income, and given the country’s chronic water shortages, declining availability of high-quality farmland and rising feed imports, it is certain that it will not be halved yet again by the 2030s as it was during the past generation. And the food production and supply situation in India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria or Ethiopia is far behind China’s achievements, and it will put even greater limits on the eventual rise in meat demand. In a rational world, consumers in the rich countries should be willing to pay more for a food in order to lower the environmental impacts of its production, especially when that higher cost and the resulting lower consumption would also improve agriculture’s long-term prospects and benefit the health of the affected population. </p>
<p> So far, modern societies have shown little inclination to follow such a course – but I think that during the coming decades, a combination of economic and environmental realities will hasten such rational changes. Short-term outlook for complex systems is usually more of the same, but (as in the past) unpredictable events (or events whose eventual occurrence is widely anticipated but whose timing is beyond our ken) will eventually lead to some relatively rapid changes. These realities make it impossible to predict the durability of specific trends, but I think that during the next two to four decades, the odds are more than even that many rational adjustments needed to moderate livestock’s environmental impact (changes ranging from higher meat prices and reduced meat intakes to steps leading to lower environmental impacts of livestock production) will take place – if not by design, then by the force of changing circumstances. </p>
<p> Most nations in the West, as well as Japan, have already seen saturations of per capita meat consumption: inexorably, growth curves have entered the last, plateauing, stage and in some cases have gone beyond it, resulting in actual consumption declines. Most low-income countries are still at various points along the rapidly ascending phase of their consumption growth curves, but some are already approaching the upper bend. There is a high probability that by the middle of the 21st century, global meat production will cease to pose a steadily growing threat to the biosphere’s integrity. </p>

<p> Nutrition Advice </p>
<p> Should I Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> Fruit contains important vitamins, phytonutrients, and antioxidants, but its fructose content can contribute to sugar addiction and cravings, and make it harder to lose weight. </p>
<p> So Should I Eat Fruit? </p>
<p> Let me be very clear: This does not mean you shouldn’t eat fruit! </p>
<p> Fruit is good for you, and you shouldn’t give it up. Rather than taking an all-or-nothing approach, use this information to make smart fruit choices: </p>
<p> Eat protein with carbohydrates (in this case, fruit). </p>
<p> Eating protein and/or fat is an important way to control the blood sugar spike from fruit sugar. Fruit (or any carbohydrate) eaten alone can raise blood sugar pretty quickly. One medium apple, for example, contains about 19 grams of sugar. </p>
<p> Eat a protein or fat source with fruit to slow down the sugar release. For example, put some peanut butter on that apple, or have a few tablespoons of cottage cheese with your blueberries. If fat loss or reducing your diabetes risk is among your health goals, stick with lower-glycemic fruits like berries and cherries. </p>
<p> Fruit contains sugar, but it’s full of healthy stuff. </p>
<p> Blueberries and other fruits are packed with nutrients, ﬁber, antioxidants, and all kinds of other goodness that cumulatively lower sugar impact. The fiber and nutrients in blueberries are the reason they’re relatively low on the glycemic index, despite their sugar content. In fact, studies show blueberries can actually help normalize blood sugar levels and reduce your risk of diabetes. </p>
<p> Not all fruits contain lots of sugar. </p>
<p> We generally classify all fruits as a carbohydrate source. But a few exceptions exist, including avocado, olives, and coconut. These are low-sugar low-sugar fruits that supply healthy dietary fats. </p>
<p> Frozen is fine. </p>
<p> When fresh fruit isn’t available locally, frozen fruit can be a healthy alternative to fresh fruit. Read the labels to make sure you stay away from added sugars. Buy the frozen versions of real food, not pre-packaged processed fruits loaded with chemicals and sugar. </p>
<p> Fruit is not an all-you-can-eat food. </p>
<p> Certain meal plans label fruit as a “free” food. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but gorging on bananas and mangoes all day won’t do your diet any favors. Excessive amounts of any fruit —more than a couple pieces a day (and even less for sugar-sensitive people) – will increase fat storage. Watch your fruit portions carefully. </p>
<p> Dried fruit should be treated like candy. </p>
<p> Seemingly healthy foods like raisins, dates, or dried apricots count as sugar just like candy. Why? You’re not getting enough fiber and nutrients to offset the high calorie concentration, and the impact of concentrated sugar on your insulin response. </p>
<p> Fruit juice should be treated like soda – it does not count as eating fruit. </p>
<p> When food is “unwrapped” from its ﬁber — and fruit juice most certainly is — its sugar impact is exponentially increased. Fruit juice has too much sugar to justify the nutrients it contains. Commercial juices that contain high-fructose corn syrup, artificial flavoring and coloring, and preservatives are even worse. </p>
<p> Fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt can have as much sugar as a candy bar. </p>
<p> Skip the sugar-loaded commercial varieties and stir real berries into unsweetened Greek yogurt (if you’re not dairy sensitive) or coconut yogurt (if you are). </p>
<p> Vegetables are generally a better choice than fruit. </p>
<p> Almost all the nutrients found in fruits are obtainable in vegetables, and with substantially less impact on blood sugar. Eat a wide variety of organic vegetables in a wide variety of colors. </p>
<p> Fruit as a sweetener does not automatically make it healthy. </p>
<p> Fruit-based sweeteners like agave, fruit-juice concentrate, and honey are still loaded with sugar. It doesn’t matter whether it comes from bees, fruit, or sugar cane. Be very judicious in your portions and use! </p>
<p> Organic is best, but non-organic is way better than none. </p>
<p> If you’re on a tight budget, or don’t have access to local organic produce, conventional fruits and vegetables still contain vital nutrients. Be sure to thoroughly wash non-organic produce in a vegetable wash before eating or cooking. </p>

<p> Should I Worry if My Urine Smells of the Food I Just Ate? </p>
<p> Normal urine has a clear yellow color and a slight ammonia smell. Urine forms when your kidneys filter excess water from your bloodstream, along with waste byproducts. As red blood cells age, hemoglobin in the cells breaks down and forms a yellow compound called urochrome, giving urine its yellow tint. Some compounds in foods and medicines temporarily give urine unusual colors and odors. Most urine odors mark changes in diet but not changes in health 1. </p>
<p> Food Odors </p>
<p> Not all foods pass odors along to your urine. Foods that do include asparagus, coffee and some spices. Asparagus, one of the worst offenders, gives the urine of most people a foul, sulfurous stench. Not everyone who eats asparagus experiences the same effects, leading researchers to suspect that either some people can't smell the compounds or not all people produce the smell. If the odor of your urine corresponds to the smell of food you recently ate, in most cases you shouldn't worry. Some specific odors could indicate medical problems. </p>

<p> Sweet Urine </p>
<p> If your pancreas works properly, sugar in the blood triggers a flood of insulin needed to process the fuel. In diabetics, insufficient insulin causes blood sugar to rise. Excess sugar gives your urine a sweet smell. Urine that smells like maple sugar could mark a rare genetic disorder called maple sugar urine disease. Victims of MSUD lack the enzymes needed for breaking down some amino acids. The unusable amino acids leave the body through the urine, giving it a maple sugar odor. MSUD usually manifests in infancy. If you're an adult in good health, you're not at risk, but if the disease runs in your family, you could carry the gene responsible for the condition. </p>

<p> Foul Odors </p>
<p> Some medications such as antibiotics might add odd odors and strange colors to urine. If you're taking prescription medicine and note unusual urine qualities, ask your doctor whether the drug causes these side effects. B-complex vitamins give urine a harmless, odd smell and a surprising yellowish-green murky color. Foods such as beets and blackberries temporarily color your urine. Dark urine in any shade of red or purple, unrelated to food, might signal internal bleeding from a urinary infection. Bad odors sometimes accompany these problems, along with pain in the lower back or painful urination. Liver disease could give your urine an unusual musty odor. </p>

<p> If you don't drink enough water, your urine could acquire a cloudy yellow color and an ammonia smell. Waste products concentrate in the urine as your body dehydrates and excretes less water. When you drink enough water -- about eight glasses a day in normal conditions -- your urine appears light yellow and clear, with less ammonia odor. If you notice the smell of feces when you urinate, this could mark a serious internal disorder called diverticulosis. Abnormal pouches forming on the walls of your intestines could connect to your bladder through a growth called a fistula. Report any consistent changes in urine color and odor to your doctor 1. </p>

<p> Should You Eat Fruit after Dinner? </p>
<p> 6 minutes </p>
<p> Did you know that the best time to eat fruit is in the morning? It gives you all the energy you need to face the day. </p>
<p> Last update: 26 September, 2018 </p>
<p> There are some votes in favor and others against eating fruit after dinner or at night in general. Some people say fruit isn’t technically a dessert; others think it’s better to eat fruit before dinner. And of course, plenty of people believe that eating an apple, pear, or banana after dinner can be a simple and sweet treat. </p>
<p> In today’s article we’ll clear up this mystery. Don’t change the page! </p>
<p> Eating fruit before dinner </p>
<p> You’ve probably been taught to eat savory things first, followed by sweet foods. But some people think that, in order to avoid problems with digestion, it’s better to eat sweet things like fruit before your dinner. </p>
<p> Why? Because it will make you feel more full and satisfied. That’s great if you’re on a diet and don’t want to put on two pounds before you go to bed. Some people eat a lot of food for dinner, and that’s not good for your overall health. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you choose to eat fruit after dinner, you’re adding up the calories contained in these fruits and they won’t help you maintain your weight or lose a single pound. From a nutritional point of view, eating fruit after dinner doesn’t help you with weight loss the same way it does during the day. </p>
<p> This is because fruits help speed up your metabolism, but this only happens when you’re active. If you’re lying on the sofa or in bed asleep, your metabolism is always going to work slower. </p>
<p> Most of the time, people (hopefully) only eat one piece of fruit after dinner as a dessert. But that’s the worst time to eat them. </p>
<p> Most of the nutrients we listed above are lost during your digestion thanks to the fermentation of the sugar in fruits. That’s why a lot of people feel sick when they eat fruit. </p>
<p> It’s not a great idea to eat fruit whenever you want during the day either, because fruit contains a substance known as fructose that the body turns into glucose and energy. If you don’t use it up, your body stores it as fat. </p>
<p> The advantages and disadvantages of eating fruit after dinner </p>
<p> Let’s start with a list of why fruits can be an excellent option for dessert: </p>
<p> They’re a healthy and delicious snack when you don’t eat them excessively. </p>
<p> They contain vitamins, nutrients, and minerals that your body needs. </p>
<p> They help reduce the risk of serious diseases. </p>
<p> Fruits help you maintain a healthy weight. </p>
<p> They’re a better alternative to desserts filled with processed sugars, other sweets, and more. </p>
<p> They can help satisfy your appetite so you don’t eat as much at night. </p>
<p> As for the cons: </p>
<p> Since most fruits contain sugar, the sugar spike they produce in the bloodstream isn’t recommended for people who suffer from diabetes. </p>
<p> They can interfere with your weight loss goals if you replace any other food item with fruit. </p>
<p> So when is the best time to eat fruit? </p>
<p> Considering all the information above, we just have one question (and undoubtedly you do too): when can you eat fruit? As everyone knows, it’s good for your health, but the theory that you shouldn’t eat it for dessert is a bit confusing. </p>
<p> Here’s the answer: it’s best to eat fruit in the morning. And naturally, we’ll give you plenty of information to back up this claim. </p>
<p> Eating fruit at breakfast is a great way to start your day with a healthy dose of natural energy. Your metabolism works the fastest until noon because this is usually the time that you’re most active during the day. </p>
<p> If you have an apple, orange, strawberries, or a pear for breakfast (along with other healthy choices, of course), you’ll burn more calories than you would if you only drank a cup of coffee. </p>
<p> Remember fruits have a low fat content, so it’s not a good idea to only limit yourself to these foods in the morning. Your body needs carbohydrates as well, and especially fiber. </p>
<p> But in addition to eating your fruit in the morning, you can also eat them as an afternoon snack. They’re perfect for when your “battery is running low” and you still have tons of things to do, like going to the gym after work, night classes, or when your family is waiting for you at home. </p>
<p> Fruits are an essential component of your diet, as long as you eat them correctly. Everything depends on your personal body type and how much you eat. </p>
<p> For example, if you want to have a few grapes after dinner, that’s fine, but avoid something heavier like a banana. </p>
<p> Helpful guidelines you should remember </p>
<p> Always have a variety of healthy and natural smack options available for when you’re running low on energy, and then remember these central principles: </p>
<p> Eat fruit before dinner </p>
<p> Eat fruit at breakfast </p>
<p> And eat fruit in the afternoon </p>
<p> Also, let’s add one more: eat fruit by itself </p>
<p> This is how you can take the best advantage of the nutrients contained in these delicious natural foods. By doing so, you’ll be avoiding the following issues: </p>
<p> Weight gain </p>
<p> Acidity </p>
<p> And now, one last tip: don’t mix different types of fruits together. For example, sour and sweet fruits. Try sticking to one type at a time. And always eat fresh fruits – avoid those that are canned, processed, frozen, or sold in the grocery store as juice. Whenever possible, buy organic fruits. </p>

<doc id="file21599572" filename="should-you-still-eat-your-food-if-a-fly-lands-on-it.html" parent_folder="web2" url="https://www.healthguidance.org/entry/17349/1/should-you-still-eat-your-food-if-a-fly-lands-on-it.html">
<p> Should You Still Eat Your Food If a Fly Lands on It? </p>
<p> There are a few things that we find rather gross and off putting that can happen to our food. One of the biggest and most disturbing is when an insect of some sort or another lands on it; one of the worst culprits here being the common housefly. They’re everywhere and easy to come by, but unfortunately they’re also particularly disgusting what with being all hairy, crawly and unhygienic. </p>
<p> While we feel naturally put off by foods that flies have landed on though, you may be wondering whether there’s actually any reason to avoid the foods they’ve touched or whether we’re just making a fuss. Let’s find out… </p>
<p> What Happens When a Fly Lands on Our Food? </p>
<p> As it happens, flies don’t just look disgusting, but actually are pretty disgusting creatures with a number of bad habits. One of these bad habits is simply loving other really disgusting stuff. That is to say that flies are attracting to things like corpses, like faeces, like rubbish and like stagnant water. And when a fly lands on your food, there’s a good chance that it has just come from landing on some poop. As you might imagine, this means that their hairs can actually still carry traces of faeces and bacteria from those sources and it means that they can end up on your food… not good! </p>
<p> I actually have a friend who works in developing countries to help supply them with fresh water (yep, I feel unimportant too). One of the big issues they have out there is sanitation, and to demonstrate to them how important this is, they sometimes take a strand of hair, dip it into some manure, and then dip it into a glass of water. Then they ask those watching to drink the water. Normally they say no… </p>
<p> Flies also have a slightly bad habit of puking everything. If your dinner date did that, you’d probably leave. </p>
<p> The reason that flies do this is that they can’t chew, and so they need to spit their enzymes out onto the food they plan to consume, and then ‘slurp’ it back up. So when they land on your grub, this is actually what they’re doing. </p>
<p> Flies can carry cholera, typhoid and dysentery and they are actually twice as germ-ridden as cockroaches. So next time you see a fly land on your dinner, imagine it’s a cockroach. Still going to eat that? </p>
<p> Reality </p>
<p> All these statistics and scare tactics however probably aren’t going to change the fact that you’re still going to eat that food that you saw a fly land on. If you just bought and cooked yourself a delicious steak, then a fly landed on it, you’re hardly just going to toss it into the trash and get on with your life. In the past you’ve probably eaten tons of things that have had flies on them. And if you have ever eaten food that’s been out overnight (I know I have), then you will almost certainly have eaten foods that have been covered in all kinds of bugs and insects. Not nice. </p>
<p> Note that flies don’t poo every time they land on anything. Also they are very small, so they won’t carry that much bacteria and if they only land on your food for a second, it won’t get transferred across. Also, our immune system and antibacterial saliva does a pretty good job of killing a lot of bacteria anyway. </p>
<p> So if a fly lands on your food, don’t get too upset about it. Wave the fly off and continue to eat. If you see a fly buzzing around your kitchen though, then you should probably kill it to prevent the spread of disease. And if you have any food that’s covered in flies… then just turn and walk away. </p>
<p> Use your common sense people! </p>

<p> Thanks. For some reason I thought you could get tapeworm from fly eggs. Feel Better Now! </p>
<p> I just pored my pasta into my strainer and out with my noodles came a boiled Crane Fly. I am tired, and hungry, and desperate. I have now sat down with this bowl to eat it, but I'm thinking twice. That's how I got here. Nice article. </p>
<p> Well, I just got home after a 15 minute trip back with my delicious Popeye’s Chicken Tenders Combo and boy am I hungry, or was hungry. I opened my box and a fly flew out!!! So this fly had been in there the whole trip home enjoying MY chicken tenders! No way I’m eating it now How could that happen without the food preparer noticing? And how many other flies are buzzing around in there & landing on other food items???? Disgusting & now I’m eating breakfast for dinner, lol! </p>
<p> @Beth We have the same issue. My father bought breakfast from a fast food and brought it home, then left. After more than 7 hours, I wake up from bed and decided to eat. I went downstairs and my breakfast was at the dinner table, under a plastic food cover. I removed the cover, and unwrapped the plastic off the food container. A huge fly greeted me with surprise. I was hungry and I don’t know what to do. Should I still eat it or not? The fly was feasting my food for more than 7 hours! So I went to the internet and looked for answer. </p>

<p> Side Effects of Taking Fish Oil Every Day, According to Experts </p>
<p> From lowering inflammation to causing bad breath, experts share what you can expect when you take a fish oil supplement every day. </p>
<p> What happens when you're told to go fish, but you don't have access to a fresh piece of salmon? Or if you simply don't like fish? Or if you don't have it in your budget to dine on halibut a few times a week? </p>
<p> You're not alone. Despite Dietary Guidelines recommending seafood as part of a healthy diet, "[seafood is] under-consumed in a typical American diet or eliminated from certain diets such as vegetarian or vegan diets," says Mastaneh Sharafi, PhD, RD, Vice President of Scientific and Clinical Affairs at Ritual. </p>
<p> "Most people do not consume enough fish on a daily basis to meet their requirements for essential omega 3 fatty acids, and many would prefer to take a supplement than eat fish daily or 3-4 times a week," says Alicia Galvin, RD, a registered dietitian for Sovereign Laboratories. </p>
<p> So when you can't go fish, supplements are your next best option—and a popular one, at that. </p>
<p> Fish oil supplements are the most commonly taken nonvitamin/nonmineral supplement in America, according to a National Health Interview Survey. </p>
<p> "Fish oil is known for its high content of omega-3 fatty acids. The body can't make omega-3s, so we must get them through the food we eat. For those who do not get optimal amounts of omega-3s from their diet, supplements can be useful and effective," says Danielle Gaffen, MS, RDN, a registered dietitian who specializes in autoimmune diseases. </p>
<p> Gaffen tells us that fish oil supplements contain two types of omega-3 fatty acids that occur naturally in fish and seafood: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). "Both are types of essential omega-3s that make unique and irreplaceable contributions to our body's function, like overall brain and nervous system functioning as well as lower inflammation," explains Gaffen. </p>
<p> There are many benefits of taking a fish oil supplement every day, but there are also some lesser-known negative side effects you should be aware of. So we asked experts about the side effects you can expect to experience when taking a fish oil supplement. Read on, and for more on healthy eating, don't miss 7 Healthiest Foods to Eat Right Now. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> You may protect your brain </p>
<p> "When it comes to making a list of foods that boost brain power, omega-3 containing foods [like fish oil] are generally at the top. This is because roughly 60% of the brain is made of fat, and half that amount is omega-3 type fats," says Trista Best, MPH, RD, LD, a Registered Dietitian at Balance One Supplements. "It has been found that omega-3 rich foods can help prevent cognitive diseases like Alzheimer's and slow mental decline. The brain requires omega-3 fat to make nerve cells, which are vital to memory and one's ability to learn." </p>
<p> You may notice lower levels of inflammation </p>
<p> "Fish oil also may help decrease inflammation. This is due to fish oils' anti-inflammatory properties. This results in reduced joint pain and stiffness," says Allison Gregg, RDN, LD/N, a registered dietitian and Nutritional Consultant at Mom Loves Best. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) notes that omega-3 fatty acids may help relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis—an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints—but more research is still needed to confirm this. </p>
<p> You may start to see healthier hair and skin </p>
<p> "Having enough omega 3s is also important for skin and hair health, which can suffer if one is deficient in omega 3s," says Galvin. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> You may experience some bad breath </p>
<p> "When you take fish oil every day, you may experience some fishy breath for a couple of hours after taking it. This is unpleasant for many people, but can be avoided if you switch to a flaxseed oil supplement," says Megan Byrd, RD, a registered dietitian with a food blog called The Oregon Dietitian. </p>
<p> Galvin explains that this aftertaste may be more prevalent if you have a poorly functioning gallbladder, as "having a 'fishy aftertaste can be a side effect due to a reduced ability to properly digest fats." </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Men may experience improved fertility </p>
<p> "Men who take fish oil supplements every day may experience improved fertility. In a recent study published in JAMA Network Open, researchers found that fish oil supplements resulted in improved sperm count and fertility hormone levels," says Lauren Manaker MS, RDN, LD, registered dietitian and author of Fueling Male Fertility. </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> Pregnant women may support their developing child's brain development </p>
<p> "Omega-3s are essential for pregnant women because they're so important for a growing fetus' cognitive development," says Byrd. </p>
<p> 7 </p>
<p> Overdoing it may have a negative effect on your blood health </p>
<p> As is the case with any supplement you're taking every day, it is possible that you could be consuming too much fish oil. Experts say you should be wary of fish oil's blood-thinning effects: </p>
<p> "More than 3,000 milligrams per day of EPA/DHA may increase the risk for bleeding, bruising, and elevation in blood sugar. Also, much caution needs to be given to people on blood-thinning medications and those with diabetes," explains Gaffen. </p>
<p> If you are experiencing any similar side effects, consult with your physician or dietitian. </p>
<p> 8 </p>
<p> You may lower levels of triglycerides </p>
<p> Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. Excessive levels of triglycerides may raise the risk of heart disease, but fish oil omega-3 supplements may help. </p>
<p> "Fish oil may help reduce elevated blood pressure, reduce high blood triglyceride levels, and improve HDL, 'good' cholesterol," says Gregg. </p>
<p> The NIH reports that high doses of omega-3s have been shown to reduce levels of triglycerides. To manage high triglyceride levels, the American Heart Association (AHA) suggests that 4,000 milligrams of prescription omega-3s (containing EPA plus DHA or EPA only) per day can help lower triglyceride levels when used alone or as adjuncts to other lipid-lowering medications. </p>
<p> 9 </p>
<p> You may consume more vitamin A than you need </p>
<p> Omega-3s aren't the only thing you'll find in some fish oil pills. "Many omega-3 supplements contain vitamin A, which, if taken in high doses, can lead to vitamin A overdose and toxicity. Some symptoms include joint pain, nausea, and rash or skin irritation. It could even lead to liver damage over time. It's important to pay attention to how much vitamin A is in your omega-3 supplement, as well as any other supplements you're taking to make sure you're not overdoing it," says Byrd. For example, some cod liver oil supplements may contain as much as 90% DV vitamin A. </p>

<doc id="file21599677" filename="snowshoe-hares-carnivores-cannibals-photos-yukon" parent_folder="web2" url="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/snowshoe-hares-carnivores-cannibals-photos-yukon">
<p> Your fluffy pet bunny's cousin is actually a carnivore—and a cannibal, new photographs reveal for the first time. </p>
<p> During summer months, the mammals feed on vegetation, but when snow blankets the landscape and temperatures plunge to 30 below, hungry hares scavenge other hare carcasses, as well as several species of birds. (See "Friends For Dinner: Why Some Animals Become Cannibals.") </p>
<p> “It was shocking to see the first time,” says Peers, who believes the hares are boosting their protein intake during harsh times. “I had no idea they actually scavenge.” </p>
<p> Peers discovered meat-eating hares by accident, after setting up remote trail cameras next to hare carcasses near Mount St. Elias on the Alaska border. He expected predators to drop in and pick at the free offerings. Instead, two-and-a-half years of footage revealed hares ate from 20 of 161 carcasses observed. </p>
<p> The surprising images suggest animals aren't so easily classified as herbivores or carnivores—and that snowshoe hares are eating meat on a regular basis. </p>
<p> Feathery foods </p>
<p> Scientists have documented hares eating meat—and their penchant for violence—as far back as 1921, but those reports were anecdotal field reports, and this is the first time meat-eating has been caught on camera, Peers notes. </p>
<p> Other scientists have come close. In 2010, while studying mammal populations for the province of Ontario, biologist Kevan Cowcill set up cans of partially opened sardines throughout the boreal forest. Instead of wolves and martens plucking the pesce, his camera traps captured hares. </p>
<p> “They'd stand up on their hind legs, and pull the sardines out of the can that was nailed to the tree,” recalls Cowcill, who didn’t publish the observations in a scientific journal. “I’ve seen one at a carcass, but I assumed it was just gnawing on the bones, as I've found numerous bones and antlers with gnaw marks from hares and from rodents. Maybe it was actually eating the meat too?” </p>
<p> One of the strangest discoveries among the recent data, says Peers, is that hares eat the feathers from the carcasses of a bird called the spruce grouse. It’s unknown how their stomachs are able to digest these feathers, which may be a source of fiber. (Read about how snowshoe hares are coping with climate change.) </p>
<p> “It’s known a lot of animals we assume are herbivores do actually consume meat,” he says. “The reason this is a new discovery is the scavenging of the feathers. A lot of ecologists were surprised at that." </p>
<p> Intentional ingestion of feathers—which are mostly made of keratin and contain little protein—is extremely uncommon among mammals, he says. </p>
<p> He was also surprised to find the hares would defend their carcasses from other hares. Peers thinks the reason hares weren’t found on larger carcasses—say an elk—is because of competition. Being so small, they don’t have much chance to feed on a kill that has bears or wolverines on it. But something similar size, like another hare, is perfect. </p>
<p> Diverse menu </p>
<p> Many other studies in North America have blurred the line between herbivore and carnivore. </p>
<p> “It’s quite remarkable,” says Boonstra, a co-author on the new study. “These herbivores are not true herbivores." </p>
<p> While studying lemmings in the Northwest Territories, Boonstra observed squirrels hunting lemmings, digging them out of burrows and bringing them to their own dens to consume them. </p>

<p> “The first thing they would do is eat the brains,” he laughs. "In winter, most of these herbivores are on a protein-deficient diet, and they’re trying to make up for it.” </p>
<p> Boonstra adds the Arctic ground squirrel behavior poses a compelling question: Do snowshoe hares ever seek out and kill small prey? </p>
<p> There’s no evidence of this, at least not yet, and Peers says he plans to continue his research. But if the past is any guide, the snowshoe hare menu may be more paleo than we ever imagined. </p>

<p> What’s Causing This Stomachache After I Eat? </p>
<p> We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process. </p>
<p> Overview </p>
<p> Are your eyes bigger than your stomach? Nearly everyone has overindulged at one time or another, leading to indigestion, fullness, and nausea. But if you’re experiencing stomach pain when eating normal amounts of food, it could be a sign of a problem. </p>
<p> Most causes of stomachache and indigestion aren’t serious and don’t require medical attention. Mild stomach upset can usually be treated at home with over-the-counter (OTC) medications. </p>
<p> But if your pain is moderate or severe, you should talk to your doctor. Your symptoms could be a sign of a serious underlying condition. </p>
<p> There are many reasons why your stomach might hurt after eating. Read on to learn more. </p>
<p> There are many different types of stomach pain and upset. You’ve probably experienced many of them before. </p>
<p> If you or someone you know is having severe stabbing pain, it could be a medical emergency. You should consult with a doctor right away. </p>
<p> Dehydration is also a medical emergency. If you’re unable to consume liquids without vomiting or are having severe and persistent diarrhea, you may need to go to the emergency room for intravenous (IV) fluids. </p>
<p> There are several potential causes for stomach pain after you eat. These include: </p>
<p> Food allergies </p>
<p> Food allergies occur when your body mistakes a certain food for a harmful foreign invader and your immune system releases antibodies to fight it. This immune response can cause an array of symptoms, including stomach pain. Common food allergies include: </p>
<p> Many people experience lactose intolerance, which means that milk and other dairy products give them symptoms of stomach upset. </p>
<p> Celiac disease </p>
<p> Celiac disease is when your body has an immune response to gluten — a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. With repeated exposure, it causes damage to the lining of the small intestine. This causes symptoms of stomach upset and can lead to other serious complications. </p>
<p> GERD </p>
<p> Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic (long-lasting) digestive condition in which stomach acid comes back up into your esophagus. This acid reflux irritates the lining of your esophagus and can cause damage. </p>
<p> Crohn’s disease </p>
<p> Crohn’s disease is a serious, chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It causes inflammation in different parts of the digestive tract, which can lead to severe pain, diarrhea, and bloody stools, along with other symptoms. It’s a serious condition with potentially life-threatening complications. </p>
<p> Peptic ulcers </p>
<p> Peptic ulcers are sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper part of your small intestine (duodenum). The most common symptom of an ulcer is a burning stomach pain. This pain can be aggravated by spicy foods. </p>
<p> Sugar alcohols </p>
<p> Sugar alcohols, which oddly contain neither sugar nor alcohol, are artificial sweeteners used in many sugar-free gums and candies. Sugar alcohols, like sorbitol, are food additives regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some people find that they cause digestive distress. The FDA warns that excessive consumption of sorbitol can have a “laxative effect.” </p>
<p> Constipation </p>
<p> Constipation happens when stool moves too slowly through the digestive tract and cannot be eliminated normally. Chronic constipation — several weeks with three or fewer bowel movements — can cause stomach pain and bloating. After you eat, when your body is trying to digest new food, your symptoms may get worse. </p>
<p> Your doctor might be able to diagnose the cause of your stomach pain just by listening to you describe your symptoms. Sometimes, however, more invasive tests may be necessary. This could include: </p>
<p> If you suspect that you have a food intolerance, then trial and error is often the best way to identify it. You may want to keep a food diary to keep track of your symptoms. Your doctor might also recommend an elimination diet. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing stomach pain after eating, you may already have tried a few at-home treatments. If you haven’t found anything that works, it could be because you haven’t pinpointed the right underlying cause. </p>
<p> Ultimately, treatment for stomach pain will depend on what’s causing it. If you think you may have a food allergy, you should be evaluated by an allergist for correct diagnosis. If you have a food intolerance, you should try to avoid that food as much as possible. </p>
<p> A lactose-free diet may sound unappealing at first, but there are ways to make it work. You might want to consider seeing a nutritionist or picking up a cookbook with lactose-free recipes. If you think you may have an issue with gluten, you shouldn’t go gluten-free until you’ve been evaluated by a gastroenterologist and celiac disease has been ruled out. Testing for celiac disease should be done while on a diet which contains gluten. </p>
<p> Many of the uncomfortable symptoms of post-meal stomach pain can be managed with OTC medications. As always, talk to your doctor before starting any new medication, even if it doesn’t require a prescription. </p>
<p> Here are a few treatment options that you can find at your local pharmacy: </p>
<p> Simethicone (Gas-X) helps relieve uncomfortable bloating. </p>
<p> Antacids (Alka-Seltzer, Rolaids, Tums) neutralize stomach acid to reduce burning feelings. </p>
<p> Acid-reducers (Pepcid) reduce the production of stomach acid for up to 12 hours. </p>
<p> Beano helps prevent gas. </p>
<p> Antidiarrheals (Imodium) stop diarrhea and its associated symptoms. </p>
<p> Lansoprazole and omeprazole (Prevacid, Prilosec) block acid production and help heal the esophagus when taken daily. </p>
<p> Pepto-Bismol coats the lining of the esophagus to reduce burning and treat nausea and diarrhea. </p>
<p> Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) fights symptoms associated with an allergic immune response and helps treat nausea and vomiting. </p>
<p> Acetaminophen (Tylenol) relieves pain without irritating the stomach like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen can. </p>
<p> Probiotics aid in overall digestive health by introducing more good bacteria into your system. </p>
<p> Fiber supplements (Metamucil, Benefiber) help produce normal bowel movements and prevent constipation, though they can cause gas and bloating. </p>
<p> Possible complications will depend on what’s causing your stomach pain. Food allergies can lead to a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which can cause you to stop breathing. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. </p>
<p> GERD can result in damage to the esophagus that causes difficulty swallowing. Peptic ulcers can lead to internal bleeding and serious infections. Chronic constipation can lead to hemorrhoids and anal fissures, among other problems. </p>
<p> Crohn’s disease is associated with the most serious complications, including bowel obstructions and fistulas that require surgical repair. It can also increase your risk of colon cancer. </p>
<p> There are several things you may be able to do to prevent stomach pain after eating. </p>
<p> There are a lot of things that could be causing your stomach to hurt after eating. It’s likely that you have common indigestion or heartburn and will benefit from OTC medications. But if your symptoms have persisted for several weeks, you may have a chronic condition and should consult your doctor as soon as possible. </p>

<p> How to Stop Beating Yourself Up About What You Eat </p>
<p> Still obsessing over that third slice of pizza? Get over it. Letting go of food guilt and eating what you want is the healthiest food move you can make. </p>
<p> Location: My house. Girls’ night. The scene: Cheese plate. Many bottles of wine. And a running commentary from all my friends: “I can’t stop eating this cheese.” “I can’t believe I’m still eating this cheese.” “I’ve been eating so much cheese this week. I’m so gross.” To me: “I’m so sorry I’m eating all your cheese.” </p>
<p> And then: “Do you have any more of this cheese?” </p>
<p> Of course, it’s not always cheese. Feel free to insert bread, pasta, cookies, chocolate, or chips into that scenario. In this age of clean eating, detox diets, and food phobias, there is an increasingly long list of foods that health-conscious women feel terrible about eating. If we eat them in private, we carry that shame around inside us, or maybe text a friend a picture of the crumb-covered aftermath. If we eat them in public, an apology accompanies every bite, as if we can indulge only through a kind of preemptive atonement. But why do we feel so guilty—or at least think we should feel guilty—about the simple act of eating food and daring to enjoy it? </p>
<p> Why we food shame </p>
<p> For me, for years, the foods that most inspired this kind of guilt were baked goods. Specifically, brownies. I love brownies, but I rarely let them in my house because when I did, the pan wouldn’t last more than a day. If I encountered them at a party, they could dominate my whole night: What should I eat before I let myself have a brownie? Can I have a second one? Maybe just this broken piece? Why is no one else at this party eating the brownies? </p>
<p> And underneath all those thoughts was another, even more insidious undercurrent: I was sure that I was so abnormally obsessed with the brownies because I was fat, possibly the fattest person in the room, and getting fatter with every bite. “As a culture, we’ve fully bought into this myth that if we eat the ‘right’ foods in the ‘right’ amounts, we will achieve the ideal body shape,” says Glenys Oyston, RDN, a Los Angeles–based dietitian and the founder of Dare to Not Diet. “We’re sure it’s just a matter of trying hard enough.” </p>
<p> The flip side is that eating any “wrong” food isn’t merely unhealthy—it’s considered a huge failure of willpower. When we categorize foods as good or bad, we’re really categorizing ourselves as good or bad, strong or weak, worthy or unworthy. </p>
<p> But our inability to resist forbidden foods isn’t a moral failing. It’s how we’re wired. “Our brains react really strongly to restriction,” notes Marci Evans, RDN, a dietitian in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who specializes in helping patients recovering from eating disorders. “The more we say ‘No, bad’ about a food, the more we can’t stop thinking about it.” And lately our catalogue of “bad” foods has been getting bigger and bigger—gluten! red meat! anything in a package!—until we’re apologizing for eating, period. </p>
<p> This kind of thinking happens even if your reasons to avoid certain foods ostensibly have more to do with health than weight. Stella is a 37-year-old elementary school teacher who tries not to eat cheese or ice cream because they can give her digestive trouble so embarrassing that she didn’t want to use her real name. But she also feels that if she’s worked out that day, the rules are different. “If I’ve gone for a run, I give myself permission to indulge in any and all foods,” she says. “Especially cheese.” Oyston calls this “healthism” and says it’s really just another manifestation of our diet mentality, in which feeling healthy depends on the activities or habits that we associate with being thin. In some instances, obsessing about whether you should restrict your intake of certain foods can be an early sign of a more severe disordered eating pattern. “Even if it never gets bad enough to be clinically diagnosable, it’s still a problem when your thoughts about food take up so much mental space that other parts of your life begin to suffer,” says Christy Harrison, RD, a dietitian and intuitive-eating counselor in Brooklyn, New York. Like when you think about brownies so much that you miss the actual fun other people are having at a party. </p>
<p> Breaking the habit </p>
<p> Most of us are not going to stop eating cheese or brownies—nor should we. Feeding your body what it wants and needs instead of restricting yourself is associated with lower rates of disordered eating, depression, and other mental health issues, says Harrison. The trick is to figure out how to end the apology cycle. </p>
<p> I became much more mindful of how I talked about food after my 3-year-old daughter told me that "cookies are yucky but carrots are good." I want her to find pleasure in eating both—but she’ll never get there if she’s coming home to find me self-flagellating around the baked goods. So I stopped apologizing, criticizing, or justifying what I was eating. Completely. </p>
<p> One cool thing about apologizing less out loud is that over time, I’ve found my internal monologue has quieted down as well. The brownies are just brownies now; I can eat them, love them, and have fun at a party all at the same time. </p>
<p> A less cool thing is that I’m now much more aware when I hear other people food shaming themselves. Jenny McGlothlin is a pediatric feeding therapist in Dallas who may also be part unicorn, because she’s never dieted and doesn’t food shame. So I asked her how she handles those fraught moments. “I usually go for a blend of humor and good-natured support," she says. "Like if a friend says she’s ‘being bad,’ I’ll say, ‘Well, you’re pretty awesome, so anything you choose to eat can’t be bad!’ " I don’t mind telling you that except for when she was pregnant, McGlothlin has stayed the same size for her entire adult life. But in so many ways, that’s beside the point. Eating without guilt is just a lot more fun. And it makes for a much better girls’ night. </p>
<p> Intuitive eating 101 </p>
<p> As you work to let go of food shame, you may also find yourself eating more intuitively, which means choosing foods in response to your body’s needs and wants. Here’s how to get started. </p>
<p> 1. Avoid nutritional mandates. "We rely way too much on our brains to tell us how to eat," says Evans. "Getting caught up in the number of calories or whether it’s a good or bad food can keep you stuck." Instead, she says, check in with your body for information. "After you eat a meal or snack, ask, ‘How am I feeling physically?’ and ‘Would I like to feel this way again?’ " she says. "Then listen with curiosity and without judgment.” </p>
<p> 2. Honor your hunger. Even if that means you need to eat lunch at 11 a.m. or have a second or third helping. "Reliably eating until you feel satiated teaches your brain and body to trust each other, which will help you feel more relaxed and in charge of your eating," explains Evans. </p>
<p> 3. Let your weight work itself out. Once you stop food shaming, you may find yourself eating more and even, yes, gaining some weight. On the other hand, many people find they lose weight in this process, probably because guilt was leading them to overindulge in forbidden foods. Either way, "we usually see weight stabilize over time," says Oyston. </p>

<p> Sweating While Eating: What’s the Cause? </p>
<p> Sweating while eating can mean more than just that the temperature is too high in your dining room. </p>
<p> “Gustatory sweating,” as it’s medically referred to, is a symptom of a condition doctors call Frey syndrome. </p>
<p> The condition causes sweating even when you eat something cold, like ice cream. </p>
<p> Other times, sweating while eating is due to another medical condition you may have. </p>
<p> Keep reading to find out more about why you may sweat while you eat, plus what you and your doctor can do about it. </p>
<p> Some people report sweating while they’re actually eating. However, thinking or talking about food can also cause sweating while eating. </p>
<p> A doctor will consider factors like your symptoms and medical history when determining a potential underlying cause. </p>
<p> Idiopathic hyperhidrosis </p>
<p> Sometimes a doctor can’t identify the underlying cause of excessive sweating. Doctors call this idiopathic hyperhidrosis. Although doctors don’t know the cause, they can still treat it. </p>
<p> Head and neck surgery </p>
<p> One of the most common known causes of excessive sweating is a history of head and neck surgery, especially surgery to remove a parotid gland in the head. </p>
<p> People who’ve had head and neck surgery can experience trauma to close-knit tissues, especially in these regions. </p>
<p> It’s thought that parotid gland surgery can accidentally damage the nearby nerves, which mixes up certain nerve signals, such as those for sweating. This is Frey syndrome. </p>
<p> Usually, whether you know it or not, you salivate and typically produce extra saliva when you eat. This is your body’s way of aiding in the digestive process. </p>
<p> If nerves to your parotid glands are damaged, you may start sweating instead of salivating due to your body’s “mixed signals.” </p>
<p> A person with Frey syndrome may experience mild to severe sweating on the head. It’s usually mild. </p>
<p> Some foods and drinks are known to cause sweating while eating. These include hot and spicy foods. </p>
<p> Some people also find they sweat more when they drink alcohol. This is because alcohol naturally dilates, or widens, peripheral blood vessels, which causes the body to release heat. </p>
<p> However, if you have problems with sweating while eating due to Frey syndrome or another underlying medical condition, you may find a variety of foods or even just thinking about food causes sweating. </p>
<p> Some people find a particular food type affects them, such as: </p>
<p> To help determine the potential underlying cause, your doctor will consider where you have your symptoms. </p>
<p> For example, Frey syndrome usually causes facial flushing and sweating on only one side of the face when eating. </p>
<p> This is because head and neck surgery, especially to remove a parotid gland, is usually for only one side. As a result, this is the side that has potential nerve damage that can lead to sweating. </p>
<p> Sweating when eating due to an underlying medical condition like diabetes mellitus usually causes sweating on both sides of the face and other body areas. This includes the: </p>
<p> If you’ve had surgery to your head and neck, you may develop Frey syndrome within the first year after surgery. </p>
<p> According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, an estimated 30 to 50 percent of people who’ve had parotid gland removal experience Frey syndrome. </p>
<p> But sometimes, sweating while eating is a side effect of a medical condition other than Frey syndrome. Examples of other conditions that doctors know can cause sweating while eating include: </p>
<p> cluster headaches </p>
<p> diabetes mellitus </p>
<p> facial herpes zoster (shingles) </p>
<p> Parkinson’s disease </p>
<p> Each of these conditions can affect how nerves transmit messages to each other. The messages may become “mixed up,” resulting in sweating instead of salivating, or sweating in addition to salivating. </p>
<p> One way you can start to help prevent sweating while eating is to keep a journal. For about a week, record: </p>
<p> when you sweat </p>
<p> where on the body you sweat </p>
<p> what you were eating when you started sweating </p>
<p> Review this information at the end of the week to determine whether there are any food patterns that cause you to sweat more. </p>
<p> You can try to eliminate these foods to see if refraining from eating thems reduce your sweating. If you find you’re having to severely restrict your diet, you may need to see your doctor. </p>
<p> Keeping some items on hand to reduce sweat and moisture on your face can help, too. Examples include tissues or blotting papers. </p>
<p> If you’ve tried at-home steps and still have concerns, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p> Several prescription approaches are available. Examples include prescription-strength antiperspirants applied to the face or other sweating areas, or taking medications called anticholinergics to reduce sweating. </p>
<p> Doctors may also use Botox in an off-label fashion. A doctor will inject Botox into key areas to keep sweating at bay. This may work anywhere from 9 to 12 months before you’d need another injection. </p>
<p> Doctors don’t usually recommend surgery as the first treatment to correct Frey syndrome. Surgery doesn’t always work, and it could make the condition worse instead of better. </p>
<p> Sweating while eating can occur under a number of circumstances. Sometimes it’s an isolated incident. Other times it’s due to an underlying condition. </p>
<p> You can try at-home measures and see your doctor for treatment ideas. The most important thing to remember is that there are interventions that can help you. </p>
<p> You shouldn’t have to change your regular activities due to fears over sweating while eating. </p>

<p> While we have all sniffed food to check whether it has gone off, it's sometimes difficult to know which produce can be safely consumed after its use-by date. </p>
<p> Whether it's chocolate that has developed a whitish bloom or bread that has gone slightly mouldy, it's confusing whether something is OK to eat or drink or whether it needs to be binned. </p>
<p> As one entrepreneur reveals he is making millions by selling out-of-date food, it's clear that when it comes to the timeline on our packaging, there is some leeway. </p>
<p> Scroll down for video </p>
<p> There are some foods which can be safely eaten even after use-by their dates have long gone </p>
<p> Dan Cluderay, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, who runs Approved Food, appeared on Bargain Fever Britain on ITV1 last night, explaining how he sells his cheap products to busy mums and bargain hunters. </p>
<p> The 40-year-old says the secret to his success is that his business provides just what the savvy shopper is looking for - quality food at prices which save mums around £60 off their weekly bill compared to a similar shop at one of the big supermarkets. </p>
<p> He says there are only two dates shoppers need to know about: 'use-by' and 'best before' dates. </p>
<p> According to NHS guidelines, the use-by date means food has to be eaten by that time, otherwise it can cause you to be unwell. </p>
<p> However, when it comes to best before dates, it's a different story, with many produce safe to consume for sometimes weeks after this timeline. </p>
<p> Dan Cluderay's online business selling out-of-date food has proven to be a hit with busy mums </p>
<p> Cupboard staples bread, milk and eggs can all be consumed past their use-by dates </p>
<p> But while use-by dates do play a part in ensuring we don't make ourselves sick, there are some foods which can be safely eaten even after their dates have long gone. </p>
<p> In an article for the MailOnline, investigative food journalist Joanna Blythman revealed: 'Use-by dates are, of course, an integral part of our modern food distribution, whereby supermarkets like to promote the concept of the "weekly shop". </p>
<p> 'In this culture of "stocking up" for several days ahead, an illusion of freshness is provided by vast, high-tech fridges.' </p>
<p> Share this article </p>

<p> 3.7k shares </p>
<p> She continues: 'But use-by dates are here to stay. They are an inevitable part of our urbanised, retail society and it is foolish to ignore them. What is crucial to understand, though, is the difference between use-by and best-before labels - something that often seems to confuse consumers.' </p>
<p> With so much information and advice around, how can we be certain what is safe to eat? </p>
<p> Chocolate (left) can keep past its use by date. It may however develop a 'bloom' which occurs when cocoa fats are exposed to air. It is also safe to eat hard cheese such as cheddar (right) after their use by dates </p>
<p> Dry aged steak (meat which sometimes has been hung for up to 120 days and becomes dry due to loss of water content) sees connoisseurs paying over the odds for consuming essentially what is mouldy meat </p>
<p> 'Foods which are very salty, for instance, are generally safe to eat. A good example of this is pickles, which, because it is preserved in vinegar, is safe to consume long after the date on the jar,' Joanna said. </p>
<p> 'The same rule applies to sugary foods such as honey or jam. Using large amounts of sugar is an effective method of preservation, which is the reason that very sweet products like fruitcake and fudge can be eaten well past their use by dates.' </p>
<p> According to Ms Blythman,fermented food such as German sauerkraut and Korean kimchi are safe as as they are essentially food which has been preserved through salting, curing or drying. </p>
<p> She also said that hard cheeses, such as cheddar, are safe to eat after their use-by dates. </p>
<p> 'Even if it's turned mouldy on the outside, the exterior can just be cut off and the interior consumed. The same principle applies to bread,' she said. </p>
<p> Hard cheeses, such as cheddar, are safe to eat after their use-by dates </p>
<p> The same, however, is not true of soft cheeses like brie or camembert, which can foster harmful bacteria once they have lost their freshness. </p>
<p> And surprisingly, use-by dates are not too much of a worry with eggs. </p>
<p> 'They can still be used in a sponge cake or hard-boiled in a salad long after the benchmark has been passed, though they should not be eaten scrambled, fried or soft-boiled if they have been left for too long,' she explained. </p>
<p> 'In the same vein, sour milk makes great pancakes. The act of cooking the milk will kill off any harmful bacteria present.' </p>
<p> However she advised to steer clear of consuming meats after their use-by dates. </p>
<p> 'Under no circumstances should any meats be consumed past their use-by dates,' she said. </p>
<p> 'Poultry and pork are by far the biggest sources of food poisoning in Britain, a problem worsened by factory farming methods that spread contamination.' </p>
<p> And while it may seem counterintuitive to cook meat such as steak when it's gone past it's use-by date, the current trend for dry aged steak (meat which sometimes has been hung for up to 120 days and becomes dry due to loss of water content) sees connoisseurs paying over the odds for consuming essentially what is mouldy meat. </p>
<p> If you don't mind the loss of crunch, both biscuits (left) and crisps (right) can be eaten after their use-by dates </p>
<p> At the 120-day hanging stage, the mould, which is very similar to what you would see on aged cheese such as blue cheese, starts to form. </p>
<p> 'Most simply, thoroughly cooking any product will destroy most bacteria, as they cannot survive extreme heat,' Ms Blythman said. </p>
<p> 'For example, where meat has darkened because of exposure to air, it needn’t be binned. Just cook it at a high heat and it should be absolutely fine.' </p>
<p> However, she does have a word of warning. </p>
<p> 'Despite what some people think, washing meat under a tap makes no difference to the bacteria contained within. Indeed, it can even be positively counter-productive, by spreading that bacteria to the kitchen sink, surfaces and cloths.' </p>
<p> TEN FOODS WHICH CAN BE CONSUMED AFTER THEIR USE-BY DATES </p>
<p> Milk: Pasteurised milk will keep 50 per cent longer if you store it at a lower temperature. Try storing at the back of the fridge rather than the fridge door. If your milk has gone sour, use it to make pancakes </p>
<p> Eggs: According to a report by food scientist Dana Gunders, eggs can last for three to five weeks. But they have to be kept at a temperature below 5C (41F), as that helps prevent potential growth of Salmonella enteritidis. </p>
<p> Sugary foods: Anything with a large amount of sugar, such as jams or honeys, are safe to be consumed. </p>
<p> German sauerkraut and Korean kimchi: Safe as as they are foods which has been preserved through salting, curing or drying. </p>
<p> Crisps: While they may have gone soft, crisps are highly processed and loaded with salt so are safe to be consumed. </p>
<p> Biscuits: Like crisps, biscuits are also highly processed and thus can be consumed long after their sell-by date. If they taste soft or soggy simply pop them in the oven to get them crunchy again. </p>
<p> Dry pasta: Dry goods such as uncooked pasta, as long as it is stored in airtight containers, can keep indefinitely </p>
<p> Bread: Keep it in the freezer and it will last for ages. Just make sure you cut out the mouldy bits if you spot any. </p>
<p> Canned foods: Extend the shelf life of canned products by storing them in a cool and dark area. </p>
<p> Packaged salad: As long as your salad leaves haven't gone mouldy (wilted and mouldy are very different) simply revive them in ice-cold water </p>
<p> Chocolate: Chocolate can last a long time often develops a white coating, known as the 'bloom', when it's exposed to the air. This happens because the fat melts and rises to the top. </p>

<p> Mr Cluderay told FEMAIL: 'Food is perfectly fine to be eaten way past its "best before" date, as people know, but the large supermarkets won't do that and that's where we come in. </p>
<p> 'We sell food, such as cans of baked beans, pasta sauce, tins of tuna, which may have gone past their 'best before' date by a few weeks, but everyone knows they will taste just the same as the products which have weeks left to run.' </p>
<p> Mr Cluderay said they dispatch around 600 orders a day with his average shopper spending around £40 a week buying cupboard staples such as pasta, pasta sauce, flour and toilet rolls. </p>
<p> 'By comparison, they'd be spending around £100 at one of the major supermarkets so they're actually saving around £60 which they can then spend on something else. </p>
<p> 'We don't touch food that has a limited shelf life such as fresh chicken and fresh fish, but we do sell hardy vegetables.' </p>
<p> THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USE BY AND BEST BEFORE DATES: </p>
<p> USE BY... </p>
<p> You will see 'use by' dates on food that goes off quickly, such as smoked fish, meat products and ready-prepared salads. </p>
<p> Don't use any food or drink after the end of the 'use by' date on the label, even if it looks and smells fine. This is because using it after this date could put your health at risk. </p>
<p> For the 'use by' date to be a valid guide, you must follow storage instructions such as ‘keep in a refrigerator’. If you don't follow these instructions, the food will spoil more quickly and you may risk food poisoning. </p>
<p> Once a food with a ‘use by’ date on it has been opened, you also need to follow any instructions such as ‘eat within three days of opening’. </p>
<p> But remember, if the ‘use by’ is tomorrow, then you must use the food by the end of tomorrow, even if the label says ‘eat within a week of opening’ and you have only opened the food today. </p>
<p> If a food can be frozen its life can be extended beyond the ‘use by’ date. But make sure you follow any instructions on the pack, such as ‘cook from frozen’ or ‘defrost thoroughly before use and use within 24 hours’. </p>
<p> BEST BEFORE... </p>
<p> ‘Best before’ dates appear on a wide range of frozen, dried, tinned and other foods. </p>
<p> ‘Best before’ dates are about quality, not safety. When the date is passed, it doesn't mean that the food will be harmful, but it might begin to lose its flavour and texture. </p>
<p> Eggs can be eaten after their ‘best before’ date as long as they are cooked thoroughly until both yolk and white are solid, or if they are used in dishes where they will be fully cooked such as a cake. </p>
<p> Cooking eggs until both the white and yolk are solid will kill any bacteria, such as salmonella. People who are in ‘at-risk’ groups should only eat eggs, or food containing eggs, that have been thoroughly cooked. These groups include: babies and toddlers; elderly people; pregnant women; people who are already unwell. </p>
<p> Every year in the UK we throw away 7.2m tonnes of food and drink, most of which could have been eaten. So think carefully before throwing away food past its ‘best before’ date. </p>
<p> Remember, the ‘best before’ date will only be accurate if the food is stored according to the instructions on the label, such as ‘store in a cool dry place’ or ‘keep in the fridge once opened’. </p>
<p> DISPLAY UNTIL/ SELL BY... </p>
<p> Date marks such as ‘display until’ or ‘sell by’ often appear near or next to the ‘best before’ or ‘use by’ date. These are instructions for shop staff, not for shoppers. </p>
<p> The important dates for you to look for are the ‘use by’ and ‘best before’ dates. </p>

<p> Ten reasons why you should eat meat </p>
<p> Ten reasons why you should eat meat </p>
<p> Generally, the perception in our society is that eating meat means a bad omen. However, this is not true at all. Meat is essential for the healthy mind and body and the lack of meat can cause obesity, depression, heart diseases, anxiety and hyperactivity. </p>
<p> Meat consumption is generally blamed for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart diseases and obesity. But it is not the meat which is the root cause of these problems, it is the sugar present in the meat which is harmful. So remember that you should not eat processed meat, as it contains lots of sugar, salt, additives, nitrates, hormones, pesticides, antibiotics and preservatives that will lead to disease. The meat should be antibiotic free, grass-fed and free-range. </p>
<p> Everybody must have heard the phrase “eat more veggies and stay fit for life”, but no such phrases are popular with meat. Now we are going to describe the top 10 reasons why eating meat can be healthy for you- </p>
<p> Meat helps keep blood sugar level stable due to its fat and protein content- Steady blood sugar is critical in preventing type 2 diabetes as well as other chronic diseases. With stable blood sugar level, you are less likely to go for snacks and sweets between meals. </p>
<p> Meat helps your muscles to grow- You can work out for tons of hours in the Gym but if you do not have a proper diet then the muscles in your body will not grow. You have to fuel your body with proper diet (which consists an item related to meat) to achieve sufficient muscle repair and recovery to make gains. </p>
<p> Meat is a complete source of protein- Meat and its by-products are the only complete sources of protein available to us. All other forms of protein are incomplete and don’t provide us with all the essential amino acids the body and mind need to function adequately. </p>
<p> Eating meat can give you long-lasting energy- Consuming meat protein leads to burning more calories and gives you more energy. Pair meat with any vegetable diet and you will feel energized the whole day. </p>
<p> Meat diet improves neurotransmitter health- Meat protein is very good for improving neurotransmitter efficiency in the brain. It is found that people having meat in their diet have better neurotransmitter ability especially as a person in old age. </p>
<p> Meat is an important part of any balanced diet- Meat contains some of the highly essential nutrients and vitamins like Vitamin B12, D, high-quality protein, Omega-3 fatty acids, several amino acids. Avoiding meat means avoiding these essential nutrients which can do harm to the body in the long run. </p>
<p> Meat helps to burn fat- Whether your goal is to increase body weight or lose it, eating meat is beneficial because animal protein provides a superior nutrient profile per calorie of food. In addition, meat helps preserve lean body mass, which is critical for maintaining your metabolism when trying to lose weight. </p>
<p> Meat is an excellent source of B12 vitamin- There are many nutrients in meat that are critical to our health. But meat has a greater concentration of all B vitamins than found in plants, and vitamin B-12 can only be found in animal sources. The B vitamins are critical to overall health, especially mental health. </p>
<p> Iron from meat is absorbed easily as compared to veggies- Iron from animal sources is more easily absorbed than iron from plant sources. This is because various substances contained in iron from plant sources can bind iron, reducing absorption. </p>
<p> No family meal is complete without the presence of any meat item- The vegans might feel left out here. </p>
<p> After listing the good things we might gain from eating meat, the social environmentalists will say that it is bad for the environment. But eating meat is essential for our body and we must find some other way to keep the environment protected. So, do one thing, order high quality, unadulterated meat from Alffarms and relish its exquisite taste. </p>

<p> That sudden urge to poop your pants after eating and what you can do about it </p>
<p> Healthy Living </p>
<p> Have you ever experienced having to go to the bathroom right after eating, had digestion issues midway through a meal, or even gotten a whiff of coffee and had to go? Diarrhea immediately after eating is a symptom of several disorders that could be affecting your bowel movements. </p>
<p> You may think experiencing diarrhea immediately after eating your meal is caused by indulging in fast foods, but SuReceta’s integrative medicine expert, Dr. Joseph Mosquera asserts otherwise. </p>
<p> “Those sudden bathroom trips you may be experiencing are most likely symptoms of an underlying condition that happen to be exacerbated by poor food choices,” says Dr. Mosquera. </p>
<p> I did some research and partnered up with Dr. Joseph Mosquera to suss out the details of what could be triggering the need to poop right after eating, and what can be done to stop it. </p>
<p> First, let’s backtrack a little to learn about what gives us the urge to go to the bathroom in the first place. </p>
<p> The gastrocolic reflex </p>
<p> The all too familiar “trigger” sensation we feel to go to the bathroom is called the gastrocolic reflex. Once we begin eating, and have food moving into the stomach, the stomach signals the brain to in turn signal the colon to move out stuff because more stuff is coming down the pipe. </p>

<p> “Now people naturally have different gastrocolic reflexes,” explains Dr. Mosquera, “but this reflex can be affected by a number of factors from a food allergy to just feeling anxious.” </p>

<p> The 10 foods you CAN eat safely after their best-before dates – and how long they last </p>
<p> Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss regularly eats food past its date </p>

<p> Bread, biscuits, honey and meat safe to consume after best before dates </p>
<p> If you have ever sniffed your food to check whether it has gone off, you are in good company. </p>
<p> Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss recently revealed that she regularly eats food that is past its 'best before' date. </p>
<p> The Cabinet Minister and mother of two said she applied the sniff test to work out whether food was off before binning or eating it. </p>
<p> Scroll down for video </p>
<p> There are some foods which can be safely eaten even after the best before dates have long gone </p>
<p> Cupboard staples bread, milk and eggs can all be consumed past their best before dates </p>
<p> Asked whether she ate food that was past its best before date, she said: 'Definitely. I will just see if it smells OK and eat it. Absolutely.' </p>

<p> She added: 'I'm of the school that if the cheese has got mould on it just cut the end off and eat the rest of the cheese.' </p>
<p> Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss </p>
<p> Her actions are within NHS guidelines, which decree that people can ignore 'best before' labels but not 'use by' dates which could risk food poisoning. </p>
<p> Miss Truss also said she wanted to see fewer 'buy one get one free' offers from supermarkets to cut down on food waste. </p>
<p> She said every household had a responsibility to cut back on binning food. </p>
<p> Miss Truss said she liked 'wonky' vegetables that are often ditched by supermarkets and revealed she was in talks to keep more of them on the shelves. </p>
<p> While we have all sniffed food to check whether it has gone off, it's sometimes difficult to know which produce can be safely consumed after its 'best before' date. </p>
<p> Dan Cluderay, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, who runs Approved Food says there are only two dates shoppers need to know about: 'use-by' and 'best before' dates. </p>
<p> According to NHS guidelines, the use-by date means food has to be eaten by that time, otherwise it can cause you to be unwell. </p>
<p> However, when it comes to best before dates, it's a different story, with many produce safe to consume for sometimes weeks after this timeline. </p>
<p> Mr Cluderay told FEMAIL: 'Food is perfectly fine to be eaten way past its 'best before' date, as people know, but the large supermarkets won't do that and that's where we come in. </p>
<p> 'We sell food, such as cans of baked beans, pasta sauce, tins of tuna, which may have gone past their 'best before' date by a few weeks, but everyone knows they will taste just the same as the products which have weeks left to run.' </p>
<p> Dry aged steak (meat which sometimes has been hung for up to 120 days and becomes dry due to loss of water content) sees connoisseurs paying over the odds for consuming essentially what is mouldy meat </p>
<p> Mr Cluderay said they dispatch around 600 orders a day with his average shopper spending around £40 a week buying cupboard staples such as pasta, pasta sauce, flour and toilet rolls. </p>
<p> 'By comparison, they'd be spending around £100 at one of the major supermarkets so they're actually saving around £60 which they can then spend on something else. </p>
<p> 'We don't touch food that has a limited shelf life such as fresh chicken and fresh fish, but we do sell hardy vegetables.' </p>
<p> But while use-by dates do play a part in ensuring we don't make ourselves sick, there are some foods which can be safely eaten even after their dates have long gone. </p>
<p> With so much information and advice around, how can we be certain what is safe to eat? </p>
<p> In an article for the MailOnline, investigative food journalist Joanna Blythman said: 'Foods which are very salty, for instance, are generally safe to eat. A good example of this is pickles, which, because it is preserved in vinegar, is safe to consume long after the date on the jar,' Joanna said. </p>
<p> Foods which are very salty or very sweet are usually okay to eat after after their best before date </p>
<p> If you don't mind the loss of crunch, biscuits (left) and crisps (right) can be eaten after their best before dates </p>
<p> 'The same rule applies to sugary foods such as honey or jam. Using large amounts of sugar is an effective method of preservation, which is the reason that very sweet products like fruitcake and fudge can be eaten well past their use by dates.' </p>
<p> According to Ms Blythman,fermented food such as German sauerkraut and Korean kimchi are safe as as they are essentially food which has been preserved through salting, curing or drying. </p>
<p> She also said that hard cheeses, such as cheddar, are safe to eat after their use-by dates. </p>
<p> 'Even if it's turned mouldy on the outside, the exterior can just be cut off and the interior consumed. The same principle applies to bread,' she said. </p>
<p> Hard cheeses, such as cheddar, are safe to eat after their use-by dates </p>
<p> The same, however, is not true of soft cheeses like brie or camembert, which can foster harmful bacteria once they have lost their freshness. </p>
<p> And surprisingly, use-by dates are not too much of a worry with eggs. </p>
<p> 'They can still be used in a sponge cake or hard-boiled in a salad long after the benchmark has been passed, though they should not be eaten scrambled, fried or soft-boiled if they have been left for too long,' she explained. </p>
<p> 'In the same vein, sour milk makes great pancakes. The act of cooking the milk will kill off any harmful bacteria present.' </p>
<p> FOODS WHICH CAN BE CONSUMED AFTER THEIR BEST BEFORE DATES </p>
<p> Freeze bread (left) and it can last for ages. Honey (right) is safe to be consumed after the best by date </p>
<p> Milk: Pasteurised milk will keep 50 per cent longer if you store it at a lower temperature. Try storing at the back of the fridge rather than the fridge door. If your milk has gone sour, use it to make pancakes. </p>
<p> Hard cheese can be eaten after its best before date </p>
<p> Eggs: According to a report by food scientist Dana Gunders, eggs can last for three to five weeks. But they have to be kept at a temperature below 5C (41F), as that helps prevent potential growth of Salmonella enteritidis. </p>
<p> Sugary foods: Anything with a large amount of sugar, such as jam or honey, is safe to be consumed. Honey never really expires although crystals, which are safe to consume, may start to form. </p>
<p> German sauerkraut and Korean kimchi: Safe as they are foods which has been preserved through salting, curing or drying. </p>
<p> Crisps: While they may have gone soft, crisps are highly processed and loaded with salt so are safe to be consumed. They can be eaten three weeks after the best by date. </p>
<p> Biscuits: Like crisps, biscuits are also highly processed and thus can be consumed long after their sell-by date. If they taste soft or soggy simply pop them in the oven to get them crunchy again. These can be eaten two months after the best by date. </p>
<p> Dry pasta: Dry goods such as uncooked pasta, if stored in airtight containers, can keep indefinitely. </p>
<p> Bread: Keep it in the freezer and it will last for ages. Just make sure you cut out the mouldy bits if you spot any. </p>
<p> Canned foods: Extend the shelf life of canned products by storing them in a cool and dark area. </p>
<p> Packaged salad: As long as your salad leaves haven't gone mouldy (wilted and mouldy are very different) simply revive them in ice-cold water. </p>
<p> Meat: As long as it is refrigerated properly, meat can be eaten two days after its best before date. It is still best to smell it to check it hasn't gone off. Dry aged steak (meat which sometimes has been hung for up to 120 days and becomes dry due to loss of water content) sees connoisseurs paying over the odds for consuming essentially what is mouldy meat </p>
<p> Cheese: Hard cheeses, such as cheddar, are safe to eat after their best before dates. Even if it's turned mouldy on the outside, the exterior can just be cut off and the interior consumed. </p>

<p> THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USE BY AND BEST BEFORE DATES: </p>
<p> USE BY... </p>
<p> You will see 'use by' dates on food that goes off quickly, such as smoked fish, meat products and ready-prepared salads. </p>
<p> Don't use any food or drink after the end of the 'use by' date on the label, even if it looks and smells fine. This is because using it after this date could put your health at risk. </p>
<p> For the 'use by' date to be a valid guide, you must follow storage instructions such as 'keep in a refrigerator'. If you don't follow these instructions, the food will spoil more quickly and you may risk food poisoning. </p>
<p> Once a food with a 'use by' date on it has been opened, you also need to follow any instructions such as 'eat within three days of opening'. </p>
<p> But remember, if the 'use by' is tomorrow, then you must use the food by the end of tomorrow, even if the label says 'eat within a week of opening' and you have only opened the food today. </p>
<p> If a food can be frozen its life can be extended beyond the 'use by' date. But make sure you follow any instructions on the pack, such as 'cook from frozen' or 'defrost thoroughly before use and use within 24 hours'. </p>
<p> BEST BEFORE... </p>
<p> 'Best before' dates appear on a wide range of frozen, dried, tinned and other foods. </p>
<p> 'Best before' dates are about quality, not safety. When the date is passed, it doesn't mean that the food will be harmful, but it might begin to lose its flavour and texture. </p>
<p> Eggs can be eaten after their 'best before' date as long as they are cooked thoroughly until both yolk and white are solid, or if they are used in dishes where they will be fully cooked such as a cake. </p>
<p> Cooking eggs until both the white and yolk are solid will kill any bacteria, such as salmonella. People who are in 'at-risk' groups should only eat eggs, or food containing eggs, that have been thoroughly cooked. These groups include: babies and toddlers; elderly people; pregnant women; people who are already unwell. </p>

<p> Remember, the 'best before' date will only be accurate if the food is stored according to the instructions on the label, such as 'store in a cool dry place' or 'keep in the fridge once opened'. </p>

<p> Stop throwing it away! The foods you CAN eat safely after the best before dates (and what you should never risk eating) </p>
<p> Many items, including dairy products, are safe to eat after the expiry date </p>
<p> Whiskey, crisps, honey and jams won't make you ill if you consume them </p>
<p> But raw seafood and soft cheeses are dangerous after their use-by dates </p>
<p> About a third of the food produced in the world is thrown away needlessly every year - that's 1.3 billion tonnes. </p>
<p> The statistics are shocking, but we're often so scared of getting food poisoning that we would rather throw away perfectly good food than risk it, even if it looks and smells okay. </p>
<p> Femail Food&Drink can now reveal exactly what can and can't be eaten after the best-before dates - and what to watch out for if your food is on the turn. </p>
<p> ALCOHOL </p>
<p> British households throw away 3.5 million tonnes of food and drink every year - half of which is completely edible </p>
<p> Alcohol takes years to go off, but hard spirits such as vodka and whiskey (pictured) are perfectly safe to drink for years after the expiry date </p>
<p> Alcohol takes years to go off, but most hard spirits such as vodka and whiskey won't make you ill if you drink them after their best before date has expired. </p>
<p> Beer is also safe to drink once it's gone off - but it probably won't taste very nice. </p>
<p> But cream-based liqueurs and anything that's been in the sun for too long a time may be dangerous once they're past their expiry date, so watch out for those languishing old bottles on your booze shelf. </p>
<p> CHOCOLATE </p>
<p> Praise be, you can indeed eat that old Mars Bar you've found slightly squashed down the side of your sofa. </p>
<p> Old chocolate may grow white spots - called 'bloom' - where the sugar has crystallised but it's perfectly safe to eat. </p>
<p> It may not taste as good as the day you bought it, but it won't make you ill. </p>
<p> CRISPS </p>
<p> Old crisps may not be very crispy but they are safe to eat after the expiry date </p>
<p> They may not be as crispy as when they were newly bought, but old crisps aren't going to make you ill. </p>
<p> That's all thanks to the salt that often coats many potato snacks - but it's still best to eat them within three weeks of the expiry date passing. </p>
<p> EGGS </p>
<p> A report by food scientist Dana Gunders states that eggs can last for three to five weeks but they have to be kept at a temperature below 5C (41F), to prevent the growth of Salmonella enteritidis. </p>

<p> One way to check if your eggs are safe to eat is by putting them in a jug of cold water, according to Cosmopolitan magazine. If they sink, they're fresh; if they don't, throw them away. </p>
<p> If they sit on the bottom but point upwards, they're on the turn. </p>
<p> CHEESE </p>
<p> Hard cheeses are ok for three to six weeks after the expiry date (just chop off the mould) but avoid eating old soft cheeses as they could make you ill </p>
<p> Only hard cheese, such as cheddar and Parmesan, is safe to eat after its best-before date. </p>
<p> Even if these cheeses have turned mouldy, the inside will still be safe to eat, and can often last three to six weeks. </p>
<p> But never eat soft cheeses, such as cream cheese and Camembert, once their expiry date is up, and only consume them for a week once the packet has been opened. </p>
<p> MILK </p>
<p> Thought all dairy products were risky to eat once their use-by date is up? Not so. </p>
<p> Sour milk isn't going to make you ill, and you can actually use it in a few recipes, such as scones, spice cake and pancakes, to use it up instead of needlessly wasting it. </p>
<p> But if you want to keep it fresher for longer, store it in the coldest part of your fridge at the back rather than in the fridge door. </p>
<p> BISCUITS </p>
<p> Biting into a biscuit only to find it's gone stale and soft is surely one of life's most disappointing moments. </p>
<p> But the preservatives in these treats mean they're safe to eat long after the sell-by date has passed - up to two months after in fact. </p>
<p> And there is a way to make them crunchy again. Try popping them in the oven, and they should be crisp in no time. </p>
<p> HONEY AND JAM </p>
<p> The high sugar levels in honey and jam means they will be safe to eat indefinitely - despite any crystallisation that may have occurred </p>
<p> You may well have thrown away jars of honey when the bottom has formed a large sugary lump. </p>
<p> But the spread is still perfectly safe to eat, despite any crystallisation that has occurred. </p>
<p> The same applies to jam - the high levels of sugar preserve these items. </p>
<p> SAUERKRAUT AND KIMCHI </p>
<p> Korean kimchi is the hottest food of the moment, and it's safe to eat long past its sell-by date as it's been preserved through salting, curing or drying. </p>
<p> The same rule applies to German sauerkraut too if you're buying in jars for Christmas. </p>
<p> TINNED FOOD </p>
<p> As long as your tinned food has been in a cool and dark place, then it will be safe to eat for years </p>
<p> Have you still got that tin of artisan beans from years ago that you've never had a reason to use at the back of your cupboard? </p>
<p> As long as it's been in a cool and dark place, it'll be fine to use for years and years. </p>
<p> MEAT </p>
<p> Controversially, you can eat meat if it's past its expiry date for at least two days - but it is always worth having a smell to see if it's gone off before using, as off meat can make you incredibly ill. </p>
<p> Make sure it's been stored in a very cold part of your fridge, however. </p>
<p> PACKAGED SALAD LEAVES </p>
<p> Packets of salad seem to go off so quickly, leaving you with wilted and often slim leaves at the bottom of your fridge. </p>
<p> But don't throw them away too soon - they can be revived with some ice cold water. </p>
<p> They're safe to eat as long as there's no mould - otherwise they can be dangerous to consume. </p>
<p> RAW SEAFOOD </p>
<p> Never eat seafood once the use-by date has expired - it would make you seriously ill </p>
<p> Never eat seafood once the use-by date is up - if you do, you're asking for food poisoning. </p>
<p> This is one food group where it's better to be safe than sorry. </p>
<p> DRY PASTA </p>
<p> It doesn't matter how long you've had those packets of spaghetti and penne in the cupboard, they'll be fine to use indefinitely. </p>
<p> The trick is to make sure you store it in an airtight container if you've opened a packet - that way, no moisture can creep in and make it go off. </p>
<p> PROCESSED MEAT </p>
<p> Processed meat can harbour harmful listeria which could make you seriously ill so avoid eating it once the expiry date has passed </p>
<p> It's too risky to eat any processed meats such as salami, hot dogs or cured meats once the best before date is up. </p>
<p> That's because listeria - found at food processing plants where processed meats are packaged - thrives in cold environments. </p>
<p> So even if you've kept your meat in a cold part of your fridge, it's best to throw it away than risk a serious illness. </p>
<p> WHAT YOU SHOULD AND SHOULD NEVER EAT PAST THEIR EXPIRY DATES </p>
<p> THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USE BY AND BEST BEFORE DATES </p>

<p> Have you ever eaten a meal and almost right after you’ve eaten it you are rushing to the bathroom to have a bowel movement? You’ve probably used the phrase, food goes right through me! Many patients who live with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis have experienced this phenomenon. </p>
<p> Does food go right through you? </p>
<p> Let’s think about it: There are about 25 feet of the intestine in the digestive tract. If you ate a slice of pizza and stood up to go to the bathroom 5 minutes later, would it really be the pizza that had reached the end of your digestive system? Did it just go right through you? </p>
<p> The pizza would have had to travel through your esophagus, stomach, and 25 feet of intestine all in 5 minutes which would be some sort of record transit time. Even though you just ate a meal and had to use the bathroom shortly after, the food did not travel all the way through your digestive system in that short amount of time. </p>
<p> Why do you use the bathroom immediately after eating? </p>
<p> If you are eating a meal and very shortly afterward you need to use the bathroom, the cause is usually the gastrocolic reflex. The gastrocolic reflex is a reflex that stimulates contractions in the colon that can lead to using the bathroom shortly after eating a meal. </p>
<p> Basically the stomach and the colon are communicating1 - once the food you have just eaten reaches the stomach, the stomach sends a message to the colon to make room because more food is coming. The colon, being the polite guy he is, starts contracting which pushes it’s contents further down and this is why you have a bowel movement shortly after you have eaten the meal. It’s not the food that you just ate that is coming out of you, it’s waste from food that you had eaten earlier that was already further down in the digestive tract. </p>
<p> The gastrocolic reflex involves the stomach (gastro) and the colon (colic). </p>
<p> Over-reactive gastrocolic reflex </p>
<p> Research has shown that some patients with IBS have an over-reactive gastrocolic reflex with high pressure contractions in response to meals.2 Simply eating or drinking can trigger this exaggerated reflex resulting in pain, cramping, diarrhea or constipation. Several patients with IBD have coexistent symptoms of IBS3 so this exaggerated gastrocolic reflex can occur in patients who have Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. </p>
<p> Do greasy foods make you have to go to the bathroom more often? </p>
<p> Greasy foods can trigger the gastrocolic reflex. Usually, large meals or foods that contain unhealthy fats can also increase the pressure of contractions of the gastrocolic reflex.4 This can explain why you feel like you need to use the bathroom right after you eat fried or greasy foods. </p>
<p> So there you have it! The reason why you feel like you have to use the bathroom shortly after eating is because of the gastrocolic reflex. Needing to use the bathroom right after eating a meal can make a patient assume that food travels extremely fast through their system - that food goes right through them. </p>

<p> <p>What would then be the cause of meds I took soon after eating and had to go within 15 minutes or less and the pills were in the toilet already?</p> </p>

<p> <p>Hi <inline-mention user-id="2244246" username="hamster"/> , this could be that the pills are time release or haven&apos;t had a chance to be broken down. A good solution for this is to take vitamins and meds in liquid form if possible. Talk to your doctor and pharmacist about options. <br> <br> Brooke <br> (inflammatoryboweldisease.net Team Member)</p> </p>

<p> <p>Sorry - but I don't agree with the premise that the food can't go right thru. I know this happens because of something obvious - like corn or pimento that immediately shows up in the toilet. (foods I know could only have come from the current meal This is the same thing Hamster was saying..) Also, I've had an upper GI xray that they said could take up to 4 or 5 hours, and I was done in 15 minutes. So I know that the "going right thru me" syndrome can be very real.</p> </p>

<p> <p>I totally disagree. .It <a href='http://does.travel' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow'>does.travel</a> that fast. Have not ate salads or vegetables in four days. Had a Ceasars salad with supper last night and within 20 min was in the bathroom with cramps and D and it was evident that it was the greens. Lasted for hours of constantly running to the bathroom and cramps.</p> </p>

<p> <p>Can't be taken in liquid form. Thanks for the response. <br> They were time release, but they still should not pass through my system so quickly. <br> I got the doc to change meds and help find other ways to control my medical problems. <br> Though some cannot be fixed or lessened with lifestyle changes. <br> Less meds has help with some nasty side effects. Such as less weigh gain. &#128512;</p> </p>

<p> <p>Thanks for writing this. So interesting and this makes total sense to me. Sometimes, I get a reaction to food almost instantly after eating it and I would often think, there is no way this piece of food just travelled through my entire digestive system in a matter of seconds. <br> <br> Thanks for the read! <br> <br> Always dancing, <br> Elizabeth (team member)</p> </p>

<p> <p>I am sorry I wish this article was true but I am proof it is not. I ate beets about an hour ago and had to go to bathroom like 40 minutes later. The color was RED. And this happens ALL of the time. You can definitely see what I just ate when that happens. By the way today was the first time I ate beets in months. So sick of living this way.</p> </p>

<p> <p>I’ve tried almost everything under the sun to get rid of the painful symptoms of IBS. Starving myself by cutting out my favorite foods, taking dangerous (and expensive!) medications, drinking gallons of water to “wash it out of me” <br> ,but I still have the cramps, bloating, stomach upset and embarrassing bathroom runs that IBS throws at me! It wasn't until I stumbled upon this natural remedy I found here ( <a href='http://cure-ibs.bestips.info' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow'>http://cure-ibs.bestips.info</a> ), that my life changed completely. I'm feeling so much better now and all of symptoms of IBS are totally gone.</p> </p>

<p> The Halachot of Waiting Between Meals </p>
<p> “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Shemot 23:19). The Talmud (Chullin 115b) explains the Biblical verse above as prohibiting the consumption of a domesticated animal (cattle, sheep or goat) that is cooked in milk. Poultry or venison cooked in milk or beef eaten with but not cooked in milk (e.g., a sandwich of cold cuts and cheese as opposed to a cheeseburger) is rabbinically prohibited. In order to assure further separation between meat and milk, the rabbis of the Talmud added another safeguard— waiting after eating meat before eating dairy. </p>
<p> Why did the Talmudic rabbis determine that we must wait? </p>
<p> Rambam explains that meat tends to get stuck in one’s teeth, and if one consumes dairy shortly after eating meat, the two may mix in his mouth (Hilchot Ma’achalot Asurot 9:28). Rashi maintains that since meat leaves fatty residue and an aftertaste, time is needed to allow them to dissipate (Chullin 105a). While these reasons do not apply to poultry, waiting was mandated on all types of meat, be it fowl, livestock or wild beasts. </p>
<p> How long must one wait after eating meat before eating dairy? </p>
<p> The Talmud relates that the great sage Mar Ukva contrasted his approach to waiting after eating meat with that of his father: “If Father would eat meat now, he would not eat cheese until the next day at this time. I, though, will not eat [cheese] at this meal, but I will do so at the next meal” (Chullin 105a). Mar Ukva’s father was super-stringent and went beyond the requirements, whereas Mar Ukva went according to the letter of the law. </p>
<p> Mar Ukva’s practice of “waiting until the next meal” is seen by halachic sources as being the basis for the requirement to wait after eating meat before eating dairy. Posekim, however, do not agree on how long Mar Ukva waited. Some opine that Mar Ukva simply provided us with a general rule: Do not combine dairy and meat at the same meal; and, if you eat a meat meal, you cannot have dairy until the meat meal has been completed. Any further waiting is optional. Others maintain that Mar Ukva advocated waiting a specific duration of time, and that this is what halachah requires. </p>
<p> The Shulchan Aruch presents various approaches. In Yoreh Deah 89:1, Rabbi Yosef Karo—whose authority is binding on most Sephardic Jews—states in no uncertain terms that one must wait six hours after consuming meat before eating dairy. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Rema—whom Ashkenazic Jews follow—who posits that the rule is to not consume meat and dairy in the same meal. While Rema maintains that, according to the letter of the law, one may eat a meat meal, recite Birkat Hamazon and then immediately begin a dairy meal, he endorses the more scrupulous practice of waiting the full six hours. Ashkenazic Jewry has accepted the custom of waiting between meals. </p>
<p> Rema further explains that though the custom in his community (Krakow) was to wait an hour between meals, one should wait six hours. Nowadays, most Jews wait six hours, though Dutch Jews wait one hour, and German Jews wait three hours. </p>
<p> (It should be noted that instead of stating that one must wait six hours between eating meat and dairy, Rambam [Hilchot Ma’achalot Asurot 9:28] states that one must wait “about six hours.” Rambam’s intent is a point of dispute among halachic authorities. Some interpret this to allow for a five-and-a-half-hour waiting period.) </p>
<p> Why are there such diverse views on waiting? </p>
<p> It all goes back to Mar Ukva’s statement about waiting “until the next meal.” Some interpret the “next meal” to mean six hours, the average amount of time from lunch to dinner or from a late breakfast—“brunch”—to dinner. (In Talmudic days, most people ate only two meals: “brunch” and dinner.) Others believe Mar Ukva meant that one should wait an hour, the amount of time it takes for digestion to begin (Chochmat Adam 40:13). Those who wait three hours may understand Mar Ukva to be referring to the interval between breakfast and lunch, rather than that between lunch and dinner. </p>
<p> Sephardic Jews must wait six hours as a matter of halachah; there is no room for divergent customs or leniencies (unless there is a medical need, of course). Ashkenazim, however, wait as a matter of accepted custom, similar to the Ashkenazic custom to refrain from eating kitniyot on Pesach. For Ashkenazim, it is always necessary, however, to recite the required berachot upon completing a meat meal before eating dairy. The berachot serve to separate the meals. </p>
<p> If—after waiting the requisite period of time—one finds meat stuck between his teeth, he must cleanse his teeth and rinse his mouth. There is no need to wait any longer. (There is also a machloket regarding the one-hour period. Some posekim rule that a person who always waits one hour needs to clean his mouth before eating dairy, whereas others disagree.) </p>
<p> Do children have to wait between meat and dairy meals? </p>
<p> Although children who do not yet have a basic understanding of a given halachic principle are not bound to observe it, it is prohibited for an adult to directly cause a child to violate halachah. Therefore, one is not allowed to feed a child—or even an infant—meat and dairy together. (The general rule is that an adult may not make a child transgress a Biblical prohibition. Some halachic authorities make exceptions for rabbinic prohibitions in certain cases. The overall topic is very complex and is beyond the scope of this article.) Very young children who do not understand the basic principle of not mixing meat and dairy do not need to wait. Once a child has a minimal understanding of the prohibition, he should wait an hour after eating meat before eating dairy. As a child grows older, he should be encouraged to wait longer (unless he is from a Dutch family). The exact amount of time to wait depends on the child’s maturity and ability to wait; other factors may also be considerations. (For example, if a child’s younger siblings are allowed to wait less time, and this may cause him to view the halachah negatively, this must be factored into the decision.) Consult a competent rabbinic authority for guidance. </p>
<p> Must one wait after a dairy meal before eating meat? </p>
<p> After eating dairy, one can eat meat so long as he does the following: 1. cleanses his mouth, 2. rinses his mouth, and 3. washes his hands. Some also have the practice of reciting the necessary berachot after the dairy meal, waiting, and then reciting new berachot for the meat meal. The need and permissibility of reciting berachot in this case is a subject of halachic controversy. One may clean his mouth by eating or drinking something pareve. Any solid pareve food other than dates, raw flour and greens can be used. Steps 1-3 may be done in any order. One must wash his hands and clean his mouth even if he feels that they are clean. An exception for washing one’s hands is made for one who used utensils and had absolutely no physical contact with the food. </p>
<p> If the meal to follow consists of poultry and not beef, there is no need for one to cleanse his mouth or wash his hands. (This is because mixing poultry with dairy is only rabbinically prohibited.) Although there is no halachic requirement to wait after eating dairy before eating meat, some wait an hour or half an hour, based on a statement found in the Zohar. (The Zohar’s exact wording can be found in the commentary of the Vilna Gaon on Yoreh Deah 89:1.) In all cases, one must be sure to use a new tablecloth or eating surface and to use new utensils. </p>
<p> Isn’t the halachah different after eating hard cheese? </p>
<p> Rema posits that if one wants to eat meat after eating hard cheese, he should wait for the amount of time that he waits after eating meat before eating dairy. Commentators note that Rema is only referring to hard, aged cheese since such cheese adheres to the mouth and leaves an aftertaste, somewhat similar to meat. </p>
<p> What qualifies as hard, aged cheese? According to halachah, this is cheese that is aged for six months or so. The exact application of this axiom is the subject of discussion among halachic authorities. The posekim of the OU Kashrut Department have ruled that cheese that is endowed with a unique texture or lingering taste—akin to the texture or taste classically acquired via aging—qualifies as hard cheese, regardless of the precise aging period. </p>
<p> Some of the cheeses that require waiting include Parmesan cheese (usually aged for ten months), Swiss cheese (aged for at least sixty days) as well as aged cheddar (aged anywhere from half a year to several years). (Please note that not all cheddar is aged anywhere near this long.) Similarly, one should wait after eating the following cheeses (if you can find kosher versions!): Asiago medium cheese (aged for six months), Asiago old cheese (aged for a year) and Sap Sago cheese (aged for five months). </p>
<p> Many posekim are of the opinion that one need not wait after eating cheese that is melted since melting compromises the texture and flavor of the cheese. Thus, there is no need to wait after American cheese, as it is a blend of cheddar cheese and additives that has been melted and re-formed. This is the OU’s position as well. </p>
<p> Can meat and dairy be eaten at the same table? </p>
<p> Dairy and meat may not be simultaneously present on the same table. This applies, though, only to a table upon which one eats; serving trays or serving tables are not subject to this rule (Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 88:1) If this is the case, how can one eat dairy or meat at a public table or bench (e.g., at a public park) when someone at the other end of the table may possibly be eating something that would constitute mixing dairy and meat? </p>
<p> The ban on having meat and dairy at the same table only pertains when the individuals eating are friendly with one another, as there is a concern that they may share their meals and inadvertently end up eating meat and dairy together. If they are strangers, or if they eat on place mats or place an object on the table to remind themselves that they should not share meals, they may eat at the same table. So, too, if a religious Jew is eating dairy at a table where another individual is eating non-kosher meat, there is no need for a place mat or any other “reminder,” as there is no concern that the former will eat the non-kosher meat. </p>
<p> In all cases—when transitioning from meat to dairy and from dairy to meat (as well as from dairy to poultry)—the table must be fully cleaned. The tablecloth and all dishes and cutlery must also be changed, of course. Bread used with a meat meal may not be used with a dairy meal and vice versa. (Thus, leftover challah that was used at a meat meal may not be used to make [dairy] French toast.) </p>

<p> The Night Eats the World (French: La nuit a dévoré le monde) is a 2018 French zombie film directed by Dominique Rocher and written by Jérémie Guez, Guillaume Lemans, and Rocher, based on the novel of the same name by Pit Agarman. The film stars Anders Danielsen Lie, Golshifteh Farahani, and Denis Lavant, and follows Sam (Danielsen Lie) in the midst of a zombie apocalypse that suddenly overtakes Paris. The film premiered at the Angers Film Festival [fr] on 13 January 2018, and was theatrically released in France on 7 March 2018. </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> Sam, a musician living in Paris, visits his ex-girlfriend Fanny to recover music tapes left in her possession. Fanny is holding a party and brushes Sam off multiple times before telling him the tapes are in the office. Sam is accidentally bumped by a partygoer on his way to the tapes. Once there, his nose starts to bleed and he passes out. Sounds of chaos erupt outside the door of the office, but Sam sleeps through it. </p>
<p> The next morning, Sam wakes to find the apartment trashed, with blood stains on the walls and no one inside. He ventures into the stairway and discovers a zombified Fanny who charges at him when he calls her name. Locking himself in her apartment, he witnesses the death of a family from the apartment across the street who attempt to escape in their car. The apartment, which is several stories up, is the only safe location that Sam can find. The zombies have seemingly taken over all of Paris, are very fast moving, and respond in hordes to any sight or sound. They are also completely silent, making almost no noise and never vocalizing. </p>
<p> Unable to leave the apartment, Sam begins cleaning up until a shotgun blast erupts through the floor. Looking through the hole, he discovers that one of the residents below has committed suicide, after killing his wife, who he had bound to a chair after she became infected. He retrieves their shotgun and ventures outside, finding the zombies in the stairway gone. He quickly closes the doors to the building to seal himself inside. Sam explores the building's units one by one, finding most of them empty. He finds a zombified elderly man in the building's lift, binds the gate up, and begins conversing one-sidedly with the zombie whose name he learns is Alfred. </p>
<p> Sam successfully raids the building for a large quantity of supplies. He rations these and discovers musical equipment in one room, which he uses to entertain himself. As time passes, Sam becomes increasingly lonely and unhinged. Desperate for company, he attempts to capture a stray cat wandering aimlessly among the undead, but is nearly killed by several zombies. He makes it back to the apartment; enraged, Sam shoots the cat from the window. Fearing he was bitten, Sam nearly kills himself a second time when he falls asleep with the shotgun placed beneath his head while waiting to see if he would turn. </p>
<p> As winter approaches, he is forced to contend with a lack of heat, and the water supply to the apartment building stops working. Surviving by collecting rain water and creating a fireplace, Sam's mental state continues to decline. He notices one day that the streets are largely empty. Sam tests how far away the zombies are by loudly playing a drum set. The undead return in hordes and nearly climb onto the apartment's balcony by piling atop one another. An enraged Sam continues to play despite the danger. </p>
<p> That night, Sam hears movement outside his bedroom door and fires the shotgun through it. He hears cries of pain and realizes he shot another person. He attempts emergency medical aid and finds the woman's bag, which has a large amount of rope and a grapnel hook she uses to go from rooftop to rooftop. The next morning, Sam speaks with the woman, Sarah, who explains how she has survived. He retrieves supplies from the lowest apartment and kills the zombified occupants. She goes to the roof and tells Sam he will either die or go insane if he does not leave the apartment building. Sam at first brushes her off, but relents. He returns to his room and finds Sarah dead from the gunshot, apparently indicating that his conversations with her after he shot her were just a hallucination. He mourns her loss, eulogizes her, and covers her body. </p>
<p> Sam decides to leave the apartment, burning the tapes and releasing Alfred, who wanders into his nearby apartment where Sam locks him away. The burning tapes set off a fire alarm; zombies attack the building. They break down the doors and rush inside. Killing several, Sam manages to get to the roof and swings across the street to the next building, where he climbs to the rooftop and stares out into the seemingly endless skyline of Paris. He briefly hears a sound that might indicate the existence of other survivors. </p>
<p> On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The Night Eats the World finds a few unexplored corners in the crowded zombie genre, with a refreshing emphasis on atmosphere and character development."[2] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average rating of 50 out of 100 based on ten critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[3] </p>
<p> The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "Imagine 28 Days Later without the action, The Walking Dead without the ensemble cast or [REC] without the video camera and white-knuckle suspense, and you'll get an inkling of what goes on in The Night Eats the World (La Nuit a devore le monde).[1] IndieWire said, "Night Eats the World embarks on a complex meditation that makes it the most innovative zombie movie since Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead."[4] Variety wrote, "Even within the fairly small number of movies about a lone (or nearly-alone) survivor facing some endless apocalyptic or purgatorial non-future, “Night” is short on ideas."[5] </p>
<p> The film received Best Picture Award in Canary Islands Fantastic Film Festival - Isla Calavera 2018. </p>

<p> High Peaks Pure Earth has translated an essay from WeChat on Tibetans and fish which follows on from last week’s post “From Taboo to Eating Fish”. The post below titled “Do Tibetans Eat Fish” was published on June 16, 2017 by a WeChat Channel called “Elephant Magazine”. The piece takes quotes and snippets from other websites and documents and is presented in several parts under various subheadings. </p>
<p> Tibetans and Fish – Part II: “Do Tibetans Eat Fish?” By “Boye Niyang” </p>
<p> Do Tibetans eat fish? Why is it commonly believed that Tibetans do not eat fish? How do Tibetans perceive eating fish nowadays? Many Tibetans who live in Chinese areas would have had the following dinner party experiences: someone proposes to order fish, with another one immediately reminding that they should not order fish since there are Tibetans at the table. In this scenario, if a Tibetan suggests that it does not matter and she/he also feels like eating fish, they will probably end up having a controversy. For many people, Tibetans are forbidden from eating fish, just as the pork taboo for Muslims and Jews. Many books on Tibetan culture include this point as common sense. Quite a few Tibetans also claim that they do not eat fish. Is fish a taboo food common to Tibetans? Muslims do not eat pork, Tibetans do not eat fish, Manchurians do not eat dog. What are the reasons? Tibetans do not eat fish: There are two reasons for the bold and simple Tibetan people not eating fish. Firstly, Tibetans have the custom of water burials, in which the deceased is placed on a wooden raft, freely flowing in the river. Tibetans believe that their ancestors eventually were eaten by fish in the river. Therefore, they do not eat fish; otherwise it would be like eating their own ancestors. The main reason is that Tibetans believe in Buddhism. The double golden fish is one of the eight auspicious symbols, referring to transcendent and liberated Buddhist practitioners. It is a symbol of recovery, eternal life and rebirth. Fish is a mascot for Tibetans. A totem. There are many great rivers on the Tibetan Plateau. </p>
<p> The History of Tibetans eating fish </p>
<p> In fact, Tibetans eat fish and this history is very long. As early as the neolithic era, there are traces of residents on the Tibetan Plateau eating fish. Fish skeletons were unearthed in the neolithic ruin at Karub in Kham; they are very likely to be carp from the Yellow River. At the Khochu neolithic ruin, located in the northern suburb of Lhasa, they also found fish bones in pits (used for household waste by ancient people) that were left by Khochu residents after consuming the fish meat. Besides farming and animal husbandry, another important livelihood for Khochu people was hunting. Their stone tools included spearheads and arrowheads; bone arrowheads and bronze arrowheads were also found, all of which were important tools for hunting. A significant amount of animal skeletons have been unearthed from the ruin, with species mainly including white-lipped deer (Cervus albirostris), Cervus elaphus wallichii, musk deer, boar, Equus kiang and waders. All of them were games by the Khochu people. Fish bones (not yet authenticated) were also found in several pits, which should serve as evidence for Khochu people eating alepidotes from the Lhasa River. It shows that fishing was also a means to making a livelihood at the time. Besides archeological evidence, there are also records of ancient Tibetans eating fish. There is a story of a Tubo Queen eating frogs (fish) in “The Clear Mirror on Royal Genealogy”: King Drang-nyen Deru, the son of Trinyen Zungtsen (the 28th Tsanpo), married Chimza Lugyel from Darpo… Queen Lugyel was quite beautiful at the beginning, but grew wane and sallow over time. The King was confused and asked: “How beautiful were you when you first came! How have you become like this without any illness?” The queen answered that I suspected it was because here I could not find one single food item common in my hometown. The King said: “If so, it is better to get some soon and store it here.” Therefore, a trusted servant girl was sent to bring back a lot of fish cooked in yak butter. The queen hid it in a cupboard and ate it secretly. Soon, she became stunning again. “A Scholar’s Feast” added that the Queen’s hometown Darpo is the “region of eating frogs”, where people also eat fish and refer to fish as frog. It shows that although the region of the Royal family did not have the habit of eating fish, people in the queen’s hometown Darpo still liked it very much. The ancient Tibetan medical manuscript “Long Volume” that was found in Dunhuang, warned patients of various illnesses and not to eat fish, which conversely implies that eating fish was quite common in Tibetan society at the time. For example: </p>
<p> When swollen and bleeding from tiger or leopard bites or scratches…… Recommended diet: do not eat rotten fish and beef. </p>
<p> Burns: repeatedly rub every inch of the whole body with nasal mucus…… Pay attention to the diet. Do not eat venison, fish, bison meat, chives, garlic etc. </p>
<p> The “Long Volume” also records therapies for fishbones stuck in one’s throat, which also shows that it was quite common for Tibetans to eat fish at the time. </p>
<p> If a fishbone is stuck in the throat, an effective way is to prepare and drink a decoction of capercaillie throat, peas and mugwort. Eating otter meat can also help. If still not effective, buccal administration of thin slices scraped from the Antelope horn may work. If things like bones, fishbones, wood or grass are stuck in the throat, get a piece of cotton or remainder of weaving Persian Kam, slightly tear it into a ball of the size of a walnut and tie it to a string. Have the patient to swallow the ball and move the neck around, hitting it with your hands repeatedly, while holding the other end of the string. Repeat four times and the object in the throat will slide down. If gastric juice comes up, pull out the ball immediately; the stuck object will thus also be taken out. (Non-professionals please do not imitate.) </p>
<p> Until now, the habit of eating fish still exists in the Tibetan Plateau. There are even fishing villages. For example, most people in Junba village along the downstream of Lhasa river are still fishermen. That being the case, how did the belief of Tibetans not eating fish come about? </p>
<p> Why do some Tibetans not eat fish? </p>
<p> It is not completely a rumour that Tibetans do not eat fish. Indeed, many Tibetans do not eat fish or even see it as a taboo for various reasons. According to some rumours, the reason is that there are hardly any fish in the Tibetan areas. This argument is not correct. There are more than 150 species of natural fish found on the Tibetan Plateau. Some large lakes have rich fish resources, although not all fish is edible. In the Tibetan Plateau, schizothorax, one of the few toxic freshwater fish, is the biggest genus in terms of species and stock. Eggs of most of the known species of schizothorax are toxic and no effective antidote exists as of yet. We once accidentally ate the eggs of schizothorax during fieldwork. Soon we suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness and intense stomachache. Although schizothorax that have had their gonads taken out possess high nutrient value, however, Tibetans might not have been aware of this, since they have mainly relied on agriculture and husbandry. It is possible that rumours of eating fish causing malignant spirits in stomach rose from the experience of food poisoning. However, nowadays schizothorax processed by cooks have become a popular dish among tourist in places like Nyingtri. The second biggest genus is the Triplophysa of the Balitoridae family. Although it is not toxic, its size is relatively small, only 100-150 mm in length, and thus quite difficult to catch. In some Tibetan regions, this fish is even regarded as a “worm” that is not edible. Edible fish is not common in Tibetan areas and concentrated in very limited places. Even in regions with relatively more lakes and large rivers, unless it was difficult to develop agriculture and husbandry, residents rarely chose fishery as means of livelihood given its low return due to the slow growth of fish in the cold water of the Plateau. Only in places like Junba village, with its unfavourable conditions for agriculture and husbandry, has fishery existed for generations. Some religious ideas and customs have also impacted the fish taboo. Before Buddhism was introduced to the Tibetan area in the 7th century, the main religion was Bon. Lu, the underworld deity in Bon, is believed to have lived in water such as fountains, rivers or lakes. It is a “spirit-” like body of a different form, with its image often being associated with animals like fish, frogs and snakes. Lu is also a malignant spirit, which will punish people if disturbed or offended: the least serious consequence is to grow ulcers; the more serious consequence is to bring misfortune to the whole family. Due to their awe of Lu, Tibetans try not to disturb living things in water, to the extend of not even touching frogs and snakes. After becoming popular in Tibet, Buddhism is also a factor in Tibetan people’s fish eating habit. Buddhism does not advocate taking lives. Tibetans believe taking lives will bring about bad karma. However, it is impossible for Tibetans to strictly follow this doctrine, as meat is an important nutrient source. In this case, eating beef and lamb, compared with fish, can reduce the number of lives killed, since the meat of a cow can sustain a family for some time while several fish are barely enough for even one meal. Therefore, although principally “no killing” applies to all animals, in practice fish is most protected. The custom of freeing captive animals influenced by Buddhism also somewhat constraints Tibetans in catching and eating fish. In Tibetan areas, this custom is seen as an important way of accumulating merits through virtuous acts. Tibetans often set free animals for certain religious festivals for prayers. Once the animals are released, they can return to nature, freed from being killed or traded. Traditionally, the most common animal to be freed are goats. People mark such goats by painting their horn in red or by tying colourful ribbons to it. In this custom, fish is also an important and economical animal, because by releasing fish, a higher number of lives can be saved. However, it is impossible to mark fish when setting it free. It is unavoidable that they will be caught again. As a result, many Tibetans try not eating fish. Eating fish is particularly sensitive during religious festivals like Saga Dawa where freeing captive animals is common. Water burials in some Tibetan areas also represent one reason. However, this custom is not very widespread and areas where it is practiced are limited. </p>
<p> One day, I went to Tawu. It was still early when we arrived, so I wandered to the suburb with my companion. The landscape was picturesque: a dozen of houses scattered in a sparse wood surrounded by fine and beautiful grass. Outside of the wood, there was a wide creek, 4-5 (Chinese) feet wide, shallow but clear, with many big fish swimming and jumping. We were just thinking about dinner and thus caught some for food. But then I wondered how could the fish grow to such numbers and size when so many people resided here. Didn’t they eat it? I asked the interpreter and learned that it was because of the Tibetan funeral custom. Tibetans do not put the deceased in coffins, instead there existed three other kinds of practices. Celestial burial involved hacking the corpse into pieces, feeding it to vultures, while lamas chanting prayers. Cremation is to burn the corpse. Water burials is normally for people of the low and poor class, who throw the corpse into river for fish and turtles to eat. This is why Tibetans do not eat fish. We all stopped eating fish after hearing this. </p>
<p> Over such a long period of not eating fish, Tibetans are not good at cooking or preparing it. They even no longer see fish as food, just like Northern Chinese regard wild game in Cantonese cuisine as zoo animals and refrain from eating them. However, this Tibetan custom is gradually changing as the surroundings changed. </p>
<p> Tibetans Also Eat Fish </p>
<p> The Tibetan food culture has not stayed static in the face of the prospering of the market economy, which brought about development to logistics, trade and the food industry. An abundance of choices of living fish and canned fish can now be found in supermarkets and farmer markets in Tibetan cities, food markets and shops selling seafood in small towns, and even in grocery shops in rural and nomadic areas. More importantly, restaurants have long been opening in the whole of Tibet–especially Sichuan restaurants–so cooks from outside Tibet have served as a solution to the issue of Tibetans not willing to kill fish and not being good at cooking it. Tibetan people’s change of attitude towards eating fish is particularly obvious among urban dwellers and young people studying and working outside of Tibet. Nowadays, Tibetans’ attitude towards eating fish is not a homogenous and collective ethnic taboo as in the time of the Tubo Queen, but rather, exists due to various reasons, like Buddhist beliefs, habits or simply dislike of the taste, which are more personal choices instead of ethnic taboos. Taboo in Tibetan Buddhism is partially the reason but it is not compulsory nor covering the whole Tibetan area. This is what distinguishes it from the pork taboo among Muslims. Therefore, next time when you eat together with Tibetan friends, there is no need to reject fish for them or be surprised by them eating fish. If some people still insist in forcing a “Tibetan cultural taboo” on others, please share this article with them and suggest them to follow the “Elephant Magazine” WeChat Channel. </p>

<p> After a Tooth Extraction When Can I Eat? </p>
<p> After a Tooth Extraction When Can I Eat? </p>
<p> “When can I eat normal food after a tooth extraction?” At Wells Family Dental Group, we get this question every single day. The good news is, within a few hours after your surgery, you can eat normal soft foods and you will be able to consume beverages, just not with a straw. You will be able to go to Chick-Fil-A, McDonalds, Cook Out or Bojangles in about three or four days. Avoid the hard and crunchy foods for a week. Find out more below. </p>
<p> The painless removal of a tooth is known as a tooth extraction. If your tooth is no longer healthy enough to function effectively or poses a danger to your other teeth or overall health, a dentist at Wells Family Dental Group may recommend a tooth extraction. </p>
<p> Since a tooth extraction is considered a minor oral surgery, you should closely adhere to your dentist’s post-operative instructions if you receive one. By adhering to their instructions, you’ll reduce your risk of a dry socket and infection. If you fail to follow post-operative instructions, you may experience complications which can delay your healing. </p>
<p> One of the most common questions we receive from patients who have just undergone a tooth extraction procedure is “what can I eat?” For at least 24 hours after your procedure, you should only consume soft food and drinks and avoid using a straw. </p>
<p> Some of the best foods to eat immediately after a tooth extraction include yogurt, pudding, and applesauce. These foods are cool and easy to chew and will ensure that you do not feel any pain while you are eating, especially if you chew on the opposite side of the treated area. . </p>
<p> You can ease into a more regular diet once you feel comfortable doing so. However, for about a week, be sure to avoid eating hard and crunchy foods like chips, popcorn, and nuts. If you have difficulty eating hard cuts of meat, you can get your protein through dairy products. Lastly, you should avoid alcohol for at least 24 hours following your extraction. </p>
<p> Contact Wells Family Dental Group </p>
<p> If you believe you may be a candidate for a tooth extraction or have further questions about what you can and cannot eat and drink, we encourage you to contact us today at 919-266-5332. </p>

<p> Traditionally Eskimos ate only meat and fish. Why didn’t they get scurvy? </p>

<p> Share All sharing options for: Traditionally Eskimos ate only meat and fish. Why didn’t they get scurvy? </p>
<p> Why didn't Eskimos get scurvy before citrus was introduced to their diet? They have a traditional diet of almost entirely meat and fish. Where did they get their vitamin C? </p>
<p> Kevin Carson, via the Internet </p>
<p> Cecil replies: </p>
<p> This calls to mind a question I’ve dealt with before: Why do the Eskimos (or Inuit, as those in Canada and Greenland generally prefer to be called) stay there? It turns out that the people of the north have a highly evolved physiology that makes them well suited to life in the arctic: a compact build that conserves warmth, a faster metabolism, optimally distributed body fat, and special modifications to the circulatory system. One marvels at the adaptability of the human organism, of course, but still one has to ask: Wouldn’t it have been easier just to move to San Diego? </p>
<p> Much of what we know about the Eskimo diet comes from the legendary arctic anthropologist and adventurer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, who made several daredevil journeys through the region in the early 20th century. Stefansson noticed the same thing you did, that the traditional Eskimo diet consisted largely of meat and fish, with fruits, vegetables, and other carbohydrates — the usual source of vitamin C — accounting for as little as 2 percent of total calorie intake. Yet they didn’t get scurvy. </p>
<p> Stefansson argued that the native peoples of the arctic got their vitamin C from meat that was raw or minimally cooked — cooking, it seems, destroys the vitamin. (In fact, for a long time “Eskimo” was thought to be a derisive Native American term meaning “eater of raw flesh,” although this is now discounted.) Stefansson claimed the high incidence of scurvy among European explorers could be explained by their refusal to eat like the natives. He proved this to his own satisfaction by subsisting in good health for lengthy periods — one memorable odyssey lasted for five years — strictly on whatever meat and fish he and his companions could catch. </p>
<p> A few holdouts didn’t buy it. To settle the matter once and for all, Stefansson and a colleague lived on a meat-only diet for one year under medical supervision at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, starting in February 1928. The two ate between 100 and 140 grams of protein a day, the balance of their calories coming from fat, yet they remained scurvy free. Later in life Stefansson became a strong advocate of a high-meat diet even if you didn’t live in the arctic; he professed to enjoy improved health, reduced weight, etc, from meals consisting of coffee, the occasional grapefruit, and a nice steak, presumably rare. Doesn’t sound half bad, and one might note that until recently the Inuit rarely suffered from atherosclerosis and other Western ailments. </p>
<p> Vitamin C can be found in a variety of traditional Eskimo/Inuit staples, including the skin of beluga whales (known as muktuk), which is said to contain as much vitamin C as oranges. Other reported sources include the organ meats of sea mammals as well as the stomach contents of caribou. You’re thinking: It’ll be a mighty cold day in the arctic before they catch me eating the stomach contents of caribou. Indeed, you have to wonder whether the Inuit really ate such stuff either, since Stefansson describes it being fed to dogs. </p>
<p> Other aspects of the arctic diet also remain controversial. For example, some say the Eskimos could get vitamin C from blueberries during the summer months, while others say you’d be lucky to find enough berries to cover a bowl of Rice Chex. I say let’s not sweat the details of the menu, which varied from region to region anyway. We know Eskimos got enough vitamin C in their traditional diet to survive because obviously they did. Now it’s academic — most arctic natives live in villages and get their vitamin C from OJ and Juicy Juice, just like you and I. </p>
<p> Oh, and for all you vegetarians who’ve seen the error of your ways and were thinking of adopting the Inuit diet — think twice about the raw meat thing. Vitamin C might not a problem, but E. coli might. </p>
<p> Questions we’re still thinking about </p>
<p> Dear Cecil: </p>
<p> I read in a recent magazine that the ringworm parasite cannot stand anesthesia. So if and when a victim of ringworm is put under for any medical purpose, the ringworm has been known to use any means of escape possible, and it would not be unusual to see quite large infestations evacuating through a patient’s nostrils almost immediately upon anesthetizing. True? And are there any documented incidences of this? Can you find pictures? </p>
<p> — Morbid Curiosity in Providence </p>
<p> Cecil replies: </p>
<p> Definitely an interesting visual, Morb. Unfortunately (for you), ringworm is a fungus, not a critter. Guess you’re stuck with tapeworms, huh? </p>

<p> Vegan That Eat Fish </p>
<p> You may find that some vegans do consider some seafood to be okay to eat because there is no central nervous system. Ostrovegans and seagans provide two different exceptions to this rule if you count them as vegans controversial. </p>
<p> Pin On Vegan Life </p>
<p> In year 1990s the term pescatarian or pescetarian was coined which is a combination of the Italian word peace meaning fish and the term vegetarian. </p>

<p> Fish are not vegan shrimps are not vegan lobsters and crustaceans are not vegan and eating any kind of animal that lives in the sea is not vegan.

<p> Vegetarians abstain from eating the flesh of animals and fish but generally continue to enjoy products from animals like dairy eggs honey and more. Most vegans would agree with this statement. Peter Zvonar Getty Images. </p>
<p> Ive been eating fish now for a year and sometimes struggle with guilt. But how can we know our seafood of choice has been ethically sourced. Vegans dont eat fish. </p>
<p> Like you I lost too much weight and didnt feel I was reaping the benefits physically or mentally. Ostrovegans avoid all meat. Whole fish on a white plate. </p>
<p> I also eat chia seeds and flax seed oil for Omega 3. If you eat fish youre not a vegetarian much less a vegan. The simple fact is that fish are animals that live in the water. </p>
<p> I had previously gone mostly vegetarian for a summer in college to lose that infamous Freshman 10I blame the late-night Taco Bellbut never thought I could nix meat and dairy for good.

<p> A nutritionist answers your dietary questions in 60 seconds </p>

<p> Linda RaymondGetty Images </p>
<p> Question. Say you are all about that kale life, but have never been able to get on with bananas, berries, satsumas et al? Is it nutritionally cool to cover everything off by eating seven portions of veg a day? </p>
<p> ‘The fact that you’re getting seven portions of veg, and hopefully a lot of diversity in your diet, means you’re doing a great job,’ says nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert. </p>
<p> The key word there is diversity – seven carrots don’t count. </p>
<p> Lambert suggests mixing broccoli, peppers, tomatoes, kale, courgette, carrot and aubergine. </p>
<p> ‘You’ll be getting plenty of vitamins and minerals,’ she adds. ‘But maybe include a kiwi in a smoothie or pop an apricot into a tagine for variety, as they’re higher in vitamin C.’ </p>
<p> Can’t even face that? Broccoli and dark leafy greens are high in vitamin C, and the nutrients are more readily available when eaten raw. </p>

<p> Can Vegetarians Eat Fish? </p>
<p> Jolinda Hackett has written five books about plant-based cooking and has developed hundreds of vegan and vegetarian recipes. </p>
<p> There are many misconceptions about what a vegetarian diet is and isn't. While there are plenty of gray areas when it comes to what individual vegetarians eat, eating the flesh of any animal is never considered to be vegetarian. That includes the flesh of dead fish. </p>
<p> To make it absolutely clear: fish is not vegetarian. Please do not cook fish for your vegetarian friends and family members. If you work at a restaurant, please do not offer to bring the seafood special to a customer who says they are vegetarian. </p>
<p> The simple fact is that fish are animals that live in the water. Fish and seafood of any kind—just like the meat of other animals—is not vegetarian. Fish is not vegetarian, shrimp is not vegetarian, lobster and crab are not vegetarian, and eating any kind of animal which lives in the sea, lake, or river is not vegetarian. </p>
<p> Can I Eat Fish If I'm Vegetarian? </p>
<p> Being a vegetarian is a choice. While you can eat whatever you want—from burgers to chicken to fish to dairy—if you choose to be vegetarian, you have decided to avoid those foods. </p>
<p> There are many reasons why people choose to be vegetarians, including animal welfare, the environment, sustainability, and global warming. Yours may be different than someone else's or you may share similar convictions with the majority of vegetarians. </p>
<p> Many vegetarians simply do not want to eat meat or fish. It's a choice they've made and they don't miss it at all—there are plenty of other things in the world to eat. Some people also choose to go the vegan route and avoid any foods made with any type of animal product, including ingredients like dairy and gelatin. </p>
<p> If you're a vegetarian who wants to eat fish, you may want to consider why you want to eat fish and why you want to be a vegetarian. Which list of reasons is more important to you? It's a personal decision that everyone must come to on their own. </p>
<p> Still confused about whether or not vegetarians can eat fish? Consider this. A triangle, by definition, has three sides. No one, no matter how hard they try, can possibly make a 4-sided triangle. </p>
<p> In the same way that you cannot make a 4-sided triangle, you cannot be a meat-eating vegetarian by a simple definition of terms. Also, you cannot be a fish-eating vegetarian for the simple fact that fish is not vegetarian. It should go without saying that fish is also not vegan. </p>
<p> And that is what fish-eating vegetarians and four-sided triangles have in common: they cannot and do not logically exist. Period. </p>
<p> "I'm a Vegetarian, But..." </p>
<p> There are, indeed, many people who say "I'm a vegetarian, but....". They may say, "I'm a vegetarian but I eat fish." Or chicken. Or bacon. Or whatever. None of their personal exceptions changes the fact that a vegetarian, by definition, does not eat fish, or chicken, or bacon. </p>
<p> You can, however, be a pescetarian and enjoy fish and seafood. You can also be a flexitarian, which isn't really a thing at all but is sometimes used to describe a semi-vegetarian. You may also simply prefer eating vegetarian meals the majority of the time. However, with any of these, you would not be considered a true vegetarian unless you refrain from eating meat and fish altogether. </p>

<p> Pescatarians are not Vegans </p>
<p> A vegan is someone who abstains from the use of animal products. Their’s is more a philosophy to living that demonstrates a great love towards animals in every way possible. Veganism is gaining in popularity as people become more conscious of humans responsibility towards responsible stewardship of this planet and all living creatures within it. </p>
<p> History of Veganism </p>
<p> Veganism is believed to have started in the Indian sub-continent as far back as the Indus Civilization of 3300 BC. In the 19th century, it started becoming commonplace in the United States. In 1843 the Alcott House members formed the first Veganism society in Europe. </p>
<p> Since then, many variations of Vegan Associations have come about from the members of these societies and religions. The associations have different objectives and rules. In the modern world, there are people who have taken the diet up due to its healthy lifestyle. They do not subscribe to any religion or cultural view but they are vegetarians for purely health reasons out of personal choice. </p>
<p> Distinctions of Veganism </p>
<p> There are 3 broad distinctions of veganism. They are as follows: </p>
<p> Dietary Vegans – These are the strict vegetarians who do not eat meat, eggs or any dairy products and any other product that is derived from animals. </p>
<p> The manufacturing process of synthetic vegan leather involves the bonding together of a plastic coating to a unique fabric base. The types of chemicals and plastics used in the coating process are what defines whether it will be eco-friendly or not. PVC is more damaging to the environment, but there are a few cases where it’s necessary to use. </p>
<p> Ethical Vegans – These are people who follow the vegan philosophy and extend their beliefs to other spheres of life by opposing the use of animals for any purpose. </p>
<p> Environmental Vegans – They are vegans who avoid the use of animal products because they believe that modern farming techniques damage the environment. They advocate for traditional methods of keeping animals. </p>
<p> Vegans who eat fish </p>
<p> You may have probably heard of people who observe vegetarian diets with the exception of fish. These people are referred to as Pescatarian. They do not partake of any other meat except fish and they observe the vegetarian diet in totality. They source their protein needs from other sources such as beans, grains, and vegetables. </p>
<p> Reasons for being a Pescatarian </p>
<p> There are many reasons why people choose to observe the Pescatarian diet. </p>
<p> One of them is when one has health concerns such as the presence of high cholesterol in the body. When the body has high cholesterol, you run the risk of ailments such as high blood pressure, stroke, and heart diseases. High cholesterol increased by eating food that is high in fat and processed foods. </p>
<p> Meat is one of the sources of protein for our bodies and some types of meat have high-fat content which increases our levels of cholesterol in the body. To avoid a situation where your cholesterol levels are in an uncontrollable state you can choose to do away with meat completely and live on a purely vegan diet. </p>
<p> However, with a vegan diet, you will still need animal protein as it is important to your health. Hence the reason people choose to take fish as the only animal protein. This is the Pescatarian diet. </p>
<p> More Reasons for Pescetarianism </p>
<p> Another reason for choosing this diet is the animal cruelty concerns that come from slaughtering animals that offer red meat such as cows, goats, sheep. There is a common belief that animals are often tortured before they are put to the knife unlike fish which automatically die whenever they are put out of the water. Some believe that this is a mild way of putting them to death and is almost a natural process that does not use knives, hooks, and other tools used to slaughter animals. </p>
<p> Finally, the benefits of fish are immense to the human body. The moderate consumption of fish is important for our health. It is rich in Omega-3 fatty acids which provide the human body with optimal conditions for its operation. Fish is also rich in vitamin B12 which helps the body keep the nerve system healthy. </p>
<p> Benefits of Pescatarian Diet </p>
<p> There are many benefits of observing a Pescatarian diet and some of them are listed below: </p>
<p> Healthy Heart </p>
<p> The heart is often considered the heart of all living creatures. It is the epicenter of all the bodies’ activities and it controls all the bodies’ functions through the circulation of blood. </p>
<p> Fish’s richness in omega 3 acid has unsaturated fat helps in the reduction of blood pressure to optimal levels that are required for the functioning of the body. Eating fish also reduces the chances of heart attack and other heart-related ailments such as Atherosclerosis which occurs when the arteries are blocked and restrict the flow of blood. </p>
<p> Reducing the chances of cancer </p>
<p> Cancer is one of the major leading causes of death in the world today. While it has many possible cures, the best way to avoid it is through prevention. After all, prevention is better than cure. </p>
<p> Taking fish is known to protect human beings from getting colorectal cancers (colon and rectum cancer) which were the 2nd leading cancer deaths in a study done in 2015 in America. The study showed that the consumption of fish reduced the chances of colorectal cancer by about 10%. </p>
<p> Diabetes and inflammation </p>
<p> Diabetes occurs when there is too much blood glucose in the blood. There is evidence that the intake of fish significantly reduces the chances of getting type 2 diabetes. The omega 3 acids contained in fish provide the body with high insulin resistance levels which is good for the prevention of diabetes. For those already living with the condition, a fish diet reduces blood sugar in the blood thereby maintaining it at an optimal level which will help in reducing the chances of diabetes complications. </p>
<p> Diets that are rich in plant foods are also great for the reduction of anti-inflammation through antioxidants that are contained in plant foods. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> A Pescatarian diet ensures that you have the right balance of nutrients in your body. A pure strict vegan diet does not have animal protein and one would have to depend on supplements to get these nutrients in the body. Taking fish provides this alternative and it is also healthy. </p>
<p> This diet ensures general fitness for your body. It can help in the reduction of body weight and therefore an option when you want to shed weight which is disastrous for your health. </p>

<p> Should I take Viagra with food? </p>
<p> It’s not necessary to take Viagra (sildenafil) with food. In fact, taking Viagra soon after eating a heavy meal can delay absorption of the drug, which could make it less effective. </p>

<p> Viagra is the brand name of sildenafil, an oral medication to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). </p>
<p> Viagra is a medication known as a PDE-5 inhibitor. It works by blocking cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5), an enzyme that causes an erection to subside by encouraging blood to flow out of the penis. When PDE-5 is inhibited, levels of cGMP remain high, which relaxes smooth muscle and encourages blood vessels to widen (a process known as vasodilation). That makes blood flow more freely, including to the penis. </p>

<p> It’s not necessary to take Viagra with food. </p>
<p> In fact, if you take Viagra with a heavy, high-fat meal, it may take longer to work. That’s because a full stomach can delay the absorption of Viagra. A longer absorption time means that Viagra isn’t as concentrated in your blood, so it may not be as effective. That could mean your erection might come later than expected, be less strong than you expected, and not last as long as you would’ve liked. </p>

<p> Most other ED medications don’t require you to take them with food, either. These include Cialis, Stendra, Levitra, and Staxyn. </p>
<p> Viagra can be taken 30 minutes to four hours before sexual activity. You should always talk to your healthcare provider about when you should take Viagra to achieve the best results for you. </p>
<p> Should I eat a large meal before sex? </p>
<p> Eating a large meal before sex isn’t a great idea, regardless of which medication you’re taking. When you eat a big meal, you naturally divert blood flow to your stomach and intestines to help with digestion. That means you have less potential blood flow to give you a firm, lasting erection. A heavy meal may also cause indigestion or make you sleepy, two other factors that can make your erectile function less-than-spectacular. It’s not a huge deal, but a big meal before sex isn’t the best way to get a strong erection. </p>
<p> Medical conditions such as liver and kidney disease can change the way your body absorbs Viagra, and certain drugs can interact with Viagra. It’s important that you talk with a healthcare provider about your medical history and all medications and supplements you’re currently taking. You may need a lower starting dose, or Viagra may not be safe for you to take at all. </p>
<p> For example, people with liver and kidney disease may need the lowest starting dose, and people on drugs called nitrates for certain heart conditions and riociguat for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension should not take Viagra.

<p> What Can I Eat After an Upper Endoscopy (EGD)? </p>
<p> What Is an Upper Endoscopy? </p>
<p> If your doctor has recommended an Esophogastroduodenoscopy a.k.a. an EGD procedure or upper endoscopy, you most likely suffer from symptoms that can be treated or diagnosed during the procedure. Gastroenterologists can use an EGD to see what is going on inside the upper part of your GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (the upper part of your small intestine). </p>
<p> Perhaps you’re experiencing nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, or persistent heartburn. Maybe your GI specialist suspects GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), ulcers, polyps, or a hiatal hernia. No matter the reason for your EGD, be sure to tell your doctor about any medications you take and any allergies you have before the procedure. </p>
<p> What Happens During an EGD? </p>
<p> An upper GI endoscopy is best performed while your stomach is empty, so you shouldn’t have anything to eat or drink for 6-8 hours before the procedure. Before your EGD begins, your physician will probably give you a sedative to relax you and a painkiller or numbing medication to ease any discomfort. </p>
<p> You will be asked to lie on your side, and your doctor will pass an endoscope, a thin tube with a camera on the end, through your mouth to examine your upper GI tract. </p>
<p> How Long Does an EGD Take? </p>
<p> An EGD usually takes less than 30 minutes to complete. </p>
<p> What Happens After My EGD? </p>
<p> After the procedure is complete, you will be placed under observation for about an hour or until the sedative’s effects have mostly worn off. You will need to have someone drive you home and stay with you, and you’re not supposed to drive yourself for 24 hours afterward since your reflexes and judgment could still be impaired after anesthesia. You may have a sore throat or feel bloated, but these symptoms are normal and should dissipate within 24 hours. </p>
<p> When Can I Eat Again? </p>
<p> At this point, it’s been at least 7 hours since you last had anything to eat or drink. You may be hungry or thirsty, but don’t eat or drink anything until you can comfortably swallow. When you can eat often depends on your appetite and your recovery speed. If your throat has been sprayed with numbing medication, don’t eat anything for at least an hour after the procedure. When you feel you can do so, start slow by sipping water or other cool liquids. </p>
<p> Over the next 24-48 hours, eat small meals consisting of soft, easily-digestible foods like soups, eggs, juices, pudding, applesauce, etc. You should also avoid consuming alcohol for at least 24 hours after your procedure. When you feel like you’re “back to normal,” you may resume your normal diet. </p>

<p> What Can I Eat After a Tonsillectomy? </p>
<p> Kristin Hayes, RN, is a registered nurse specializing in ear, nose, and throat disorders for both adults and children. </p>
<p> John Carew, MD, is board-certified in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. He is an adjunct assistant professor at Mount Sinai Medical Center and NYU Medical Center. </p>
<p> A tonsillectomy is a common surgery done to remove the tonsils. It's sometimes done in conjunction with removing the adenoids—a procedure called an adenoidectomy. You will generally need these surgeries if you have frequent infections, obstructive sleep apnea, or are having complications related to the size of your tonsils. </p>
<p> Tonsillectomy generally will only take about 30 to 45 minutes and can be performed in a same-day surgical center or, less often, in a hospital. </p>
<p> How Will I Feel After Surgery? </p>
<p> When you are returning from the operating room, you will still be sedated, but you will awaken soon after arriving at the recovery room. It is common to have a sore throat when you wake up, and your nurse will be able to treat your pain. </p>
<p> You will likely ask your nurse or a family member the same question multiple times and will be unable to remember that you already asked the question. This is normal due to the medications that you are given during the surgery. </p>
<p> You will generally be discharged home following the surgery unless you have a significant history of sleep apnea or have a complication during the tonsillectomy. If you are under the age of 19, you will likely recover from the tonsillectomy over the course of seven to 14 days. </p>
<p> If you are an adult, you can expect to recover between two to three weeks.﻿﻿ These are just general estimates, and your recovery may differ based on your own recovery rate. </p>
<p> What to Eat and Drink After Your Surgery </p>
<p> The most common complaint after a tonsillectomy is throat pain severe enough to make it hard to eat or drink.﻿﻿ You can take medications prescribed by your doctor to help manage this pain, but eating and drinking certain foods and beverages, and steering clear of others, also can help. </p>
<p> If you're looking to stock the fridge in preparation for a tonsillectomy, here are some general things to consider before you hit the supermarket, plus examples of foods you may want to include in your diet as well as some to avoid as you recover: </p>
<p> Avoid dairy products if you're having nausea or vomiting (a side effect of anesthesia and narcotic pain medication). While ice cream can be a feel-good food after a tonsillectomy, it can be problematic. </p>
<p> Substitute sorbets, fruit pops, or fruit ices, which are non-dairy, for ice cream. </p>
<p> Avoid food and drinks that have high levels of citric acids, such as tomato juice and lemonade, as they can sting and cause pain. </p>
<p> Don't try to swallow very hot beverages or soups. </p>
<p> Steer clear of foods with hard or sharp edges. </p>
<p> Cold foods and fluids reduce swelling and pain. </p>
<p> While there really is nothing you can't eat after a tonsillectomy (other than hard, sharp foods like nachos or hard pretzels) for the first couple of days at least you may want to eat or drink foods that are cold and soft. Avoiding foods that are hard, sharp, spicy, or hot also may help you stay more comfortable. </p>
<p> Dairy products if you have nausea and vomiting from anesthesia </p>
<p> Staying Hydrated </p>
<p> After surgery, it will be important to stay well hydrated, especially for the first 72 hours. This will help keep the surgical site moist, in turn reducing pain. </p>
<p> Dehydration is a common reason for emergency department visits after surgery, so increasing your fluid intake will reduce your risk for additional visits to the hospital.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> In general, cold drinks (like apple juice, ice water, or soda) may make you feel better, as they cool your surgical sites. Warm drinks (like tea or coffee), on the other hand, may provide you with a soothing sensation that you'll like after surgery. </p>
<p> Some surgeons will advise against hot liquids because of increased pain, and the vasodilation caused by heat may open up blood vessels and cause bleeding. </p>
<p> A Word From Verywell </p>
<p> If nausea isn't a problem, live it up and enjoy as many of the cold soft foods you would typically enjoy to help reduce your pain. Items like ice cream or popsicles will help soothe your sore throat while also helping you stay hydrated. </p>
<p> In fact, it's vital to stay hydrated after having your tonsils removed, which can be difficult if you don't want to swallow due to a sore throat. It is recommended to sip on a cold drink throughout the day to help prevent dehydration. Call your doctor if you have signs of dehydration, such as dry eyes or skin, or cola-colored urine. </p>

<p> For your traditional Christmas dinner, you may be eating glazed ham, candied sweet potatoes, along with a few sugar cookies and gingerbread men for dessert. </p>
<p> What better way to celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior than to eat some of the foods that Jesus did while he was on earth. </p>
<p> Probably all of them are healthier than what’s on your dining room table for the holiday! </p>
<p> Of course, anyone claiming to know exactly what Jesus ate for breakfast or his precise meal plan is embellishing, to say the least. No human alive today can answer those questions, but we have a number of specific foods in the Bible referenced, as well as good archeological data as to what the people in Israel were eating during that era. </p>
<p> With normal historical figures, one would have to pick and choose as to which foods they ate that seemed healthy. </p>
<p> That’s not the case here! </p>
<p> Everything points to the diet of Jesus being balanced, nutritious, and healthy, as confirmed by science some 2,000 years later. </p>
<p> The list of foods </p>
<p> What follows are 15 foods that Jesus definitely ate or likely ate based on the evidence. </p>
<p> 1. St. Peter’s Fish </p>
<p> Today, fishing in the Sea of Galilee for is actually banned periodically. The last was a 2-year ban between 2011 and 2013. This was because the levels of fish had fallen dangerously low. (1) </p>
<p> However before mankind desecrated the environment and made this food a risky endeavor due to rampant pollution, fish were an excellent choice for a meal. Even if you were eating it everyday for breakfast, lunch and dinner. </p>
<p> Though it’s worth mentioning that Jesus most likely ate breakfast and dinner without a lunch. That was typical back for his culture. </p>
<p> St. Peter’s fish </p>
<p> In the Sea of Galilee, which is actually freshwater, there is what’s known as St. Peter’s Fish or mango tilapia (Sarotherodon galilaeus). It’s large, up to 16 inches in length and weighing up to 3.5 lbs (1.6 kg). </p>
<p> You will also find this species in Syria, Jordan, and the northern and central parts of Africa. </p>
<p> According to a United Nations FAO report, 96.4% of their diet is plankton, with the rest being other submerged vegetation. (2) </p>
<p> Contrary to popular belief, fish do not make omega 3, as they get it from the plants they eat. Being that St. Peter’s Fish were on an entirely vegan diet, if Jesus ate this species of fish (and he almost certainly did) then he would be getting omega 3 from them. </p>
<p> Tilapia are not considered a rich source of omega 3, however most are farm-raised and those have lower amounts than wild caught. (3) </p>
<p> 2. Bread </p>
<p> These days bread gets a bad rep. However the versions and circumstances 2,000 years ago made it a healthy part of a daily diet, particularly for those working what we would call blue collar jobs. </p>
<p> If you were a carpenter like Jesus, or a fisherman like Peter, your energy requirements each day were high. Slow-digesting carbs were important in providing the energy you need to get through the work day. </p>
<p> The flours of today often have the germ and bran removed, which strips many nutrients. The remaining inner grain is ground into a fine powder and possibly bleached. This is why most breads today are high-glycemic carbs, since they get digested rapidly. </p>
<p> Two millennia ago it was quite different. </p>
<p> Without modern milling, the germ and bran would be left intact. The grains were ground using a stone mortar and pestle, which presumably resulted in a more course flour. This would be a lower glycemic bread, offering a sustained source of energy. </p>
<p> What kind of bread did Jesus eat? </p>
<p> Following the dietary laws of the Hebrew Scripture meant that unleavened bread, which is made without yeast, would be eaten by Jesus during the Jewish holidays. Aside from those, the daily bread would be made with yeast using a coarsely ground flour; wheat, barley, and possibly sorghum. The shape may be a flatbread, as this worked better for dipping in pureed legumes and olive oil. From the past through today, that remains a custom. </p>
<p> Not quite the same, but something along the shape of this Trader Joe’s flatbread is a likely possiblity. The flour would be more course and rustic though. </p>
<p> When traveling, the bread may have been made in a more traditional loaf shape. </p>
<p> For a working class family in Nazareth, there’s a good chance that barley would often be used, as it was a cheaper grain than wheat. Barley loaves are even mentioned in John 6:9, 13. </p>
<p> With the exception of the Sabbath, each day in the village likely began with the women grinding the grain. This would be combined with yeast and possibly a little olive oil, though given its expense, oil would be used sparingly. </p>
<p> In the case of Nazareth, the grinding may have taken place on the village “mill” which was basically a large natural stone that was centrally located. Women would go to grind their wheat, barley, or sorghum using a pestle. </p>
<p> For a long time, historians were perplexed because there was no suitable rock in the area of ancient Nazareth that would fit the bill. </p>
<p> That was until this was unearthed just a couple decades ago… </p>
<p> That’s a couple of us from Superfoodly standing on that actual rock in Nazareth. There’s a very good chance this was the same rock that Mary would have used to grind grain for her family. </p>
<p> What did Jesus eat after the resurrection? </p>
<p> The last recorded meal he was identified as eating himself is mentioned in Luke 24:42-43. Jesus ate broiled fish to prove he was not a ghost after the resurrection. In John 21, Jesus fed his disciples a breakfast of fish cooked over a fire along with bread. This also occurred after he had risen, though it is not stated whether or not Jesus ate some of this breakfast with them, but most likely he did. </p>
<p> The last foods Jesus ate on earth may have been the very two we just discussed… fish and bread! </p>
<p> 3. Almonds </p>
<p> Almonds or almond trees are mentioned several times in the Old Testament; Genesis 30:37, Genesis 43:11, Exodus 25:33-34, Exodus 37:19-20, Numbers 17:2-8, Ecclesiastes 12:5, Jeremiah 1:11. </p>
<p> Benefits of almonds include: </p>
<p> More antioxidants than peanuts, cashews, macadamia, Brazil nuts, and pine nuts </p>
<p> Among the highest protein nuts </p>
<p> More dietary fiber than any other common nut </p>
<p> Rich in the essential minerals manganese, magnesium, and calcium </p>
<p> 37% of the daily value for vitamin E per 1 oz serving </p>
<p> Since it has been grown throughout Israel and the region, there’s a good chance this was one of the nuts Jesus ate during his life on Earth. </p>
<p> 4. Pistachios </p>
<p> Give your breakfast a boost with nuts consumed in Jesus’ time! </p>
<p> In Genesis 43:11, both pistachios and almonds are mentioned. Granted, that is the Old Testament and far before Jesus was born to this world, but given the fact that pistachios are native to the Middle East, there’s a very good chance Jesus ate them. Archeological records have documented it being a popular nut in the first century A.D. That’s when the Emperor Vitellius debuted pistachios in his capital city of Rome. </p>
<p> As we have reported many times, pistachios are probably the healthiest nut you could eat: </p>
<p> Tied with cashews for being the lowest calorie </p>
<p> Best branched-chain amino acid profile among all nuts </p>
<p> Among the highest in antioxidants </p>
<p> Contains over 1,000% more lutein and zeaxanthin than any other nut </p>
<p> Resveratrol content that’s higher than white wine and rivals some red wines </p>
<p> When roasted, it is the lowest acrylamide nut </p>
<p> Check out these and the other health benefits of pistachios. Be aware that roasting or baking these (and any other nut) changes their nutrition for the worse. Roasting creates acrylamide, which is a carcinogen, and that heat will degrade the resveratrol and many other types of antioxidants which are sensitive to heat. </p>
<p> You probably won’t see them sold at the grocery store, though we highly recommend eating raw pistachios (just as we do daily). Get some of these on Amazon. Being a 2 lb. bag of them already shelled, it’s a good deal. </p>
<p> 5. Walnuts </p>
<p> There is little doubt that it was this nut tree mentioned in Song of Songs 6:11. We call them English Walnuts in the United States and Europe, yet their origin is not England! </p>
<p> Song of Songs is Old Testament, though being that the nut was cultivated in this region, it would have been just as likely to be a common food source in the first century A.D. as it was in the history before the birth of Christ. </p>
<p> After pistachios, walnuts are our favorite nut. They are the 2nd highest in antioxidants, losing out only to pecans. The drawback is that pecans are mostly fat, while walnuts have 67% more protein. </p>
<p> The rest of the calories in walnuts are coming from fat and unlike the high concentration of omega 6’s in pecans and pretty much every other nut, with walnuts you are getting ample amounts of the elusive omega 3 fatty acid. </p>
<p> You can see how both pistachios and walnuts compare side-by-side to other common nuts in our table showing the healthiest nuts to eat. </p>
<p> 6. Garlic </p>
<p> Do you only associate this spice with Italian food? </p>
<p> They may have been late to the game. </p>
<p> Consider this verse in the Bible of it being a favorite food thousands of years ago: </p>
<p> “We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost – also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.” </p>
<p> That’s in Numbers 11:5, one of the many complaints made by the Israelites, as Moses led them through the wilderness. This was after they were set free from being slaves in Egypt. </p>
<p> One would think they would be thankful, but as time passed, they began to yearn for things they no longer had… including garlic! </p>
<p> Garlic is not mentioned specifically in the New Testament though being that it was a common spice in the culture, it was probably a regular part of Jesus’ diet. </p>
<p> To be clear, the following anti-cancer effect is not proven or tested in humans, though lab research on cultured human cells is finding that garlic exhibits significant antiproliferative activity, while not harming the healthy cells. </p>
<p> These charts are for cultured cancer cells of the breast, prostate, lung, and brain (glioblastoma). </p>
<p> The cell proliferation (numbers 0-150) shows you what percentage of cancer cells are left after they were exposed to the given vegetable. 100% means that all of the cancer cells survived and when the bars goes above 100% it means they kept multiplying. </p>
<p> The lower the bar, the better. It means the cancer cells were dying off. As you see in all four of these charts, garlic is on the far right, with a bar that’s at zero or close to it. </p>
<p> You also see leeks and onions nearby, which were vegetables Jesus almost certainly ate too, as they were staples in ancient Israel. </p>
<p> This study was done by a team of scientists and doctors at a cancer research lab at a Quebec hospital. To reiterate, this is lab research only and what works in a Petri dish often does not translate to animals and humans. Garlic should NOT be used to treat, cure, or prevent any disease. (4) </p>
<p> 7. Mustard </p>
<p> There’s this well-known parable told by Jesus: </p>
<p> “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.” </p>
<p> It makes sense why he would say mustard seed. Being that it was a commonly used spice, the analogy of the tiny seed and how big the plant grew from it would be something everyone would understand. </p>
<p> As to what form of mustard Jesus and the others of his day ate is open to debate. Whatever the case, this is another superfood spice. </p>
<p> Yellow mustard seeds have an ORAC value of 29,257. They’re chock-full of antioxidants. </p>
<p> As recently as a century ago, the mustard bath was a recognized medical treatment for treating colds and other ailments. That used black mustard seeds. </p>
<p> 8. Cumin </p>
<p> This is another spice in the Bible, as it’s specifically mentioned by name in the Old Testament (Isaiah 28:25-27) and the New Testament (Mathew 23:23). Here’s the verse for the latter: </p>
<p> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.” </p>
<p> Being that it was one of three spices cited as examples, it must have been popular for recipes and cooking. </p>
<p> Spices back then were exponentially more expensive than they are today (relative to income) so even smaller amounts would have been used. With an ORAC value of 50,372, cumin is a high antioxidant food so even a tiny amount is good for you. </p>
<p> On an equal-weight basis, it has about the same concentration of antioxidants as pure unsweetened cacao powder, which has an ORAC of 55,653. </p>
<p> 9. Cucumbers </p>
<p> Agriculture today in Israel is truly a miracle. </p>
<p> In less than a half-century, the Hula Valley went from being a malaria-infested swampland that the neighboring countries didn’t even want, to becoming the most prosperous region in the Middle East for agricultural output. </p>
<p> If we rewind 2,000 years ago though, the soil and environment here and elsewhere in Israel did not lend itself well to growing a diverse array of vegetables. We already discussed root vegetables like onions and leeks which were eaten. One that did grow well above the ground was cucumbers. </p>
<p> The Bible mentions cucumbers three times; Numbers 11:5, Isaiah 1:8, and Jeremiah 10:5. </p>
<p> No references are in the New Testament of Jesus eating cucumbers, though it’s safe to assume he did given that it was among the most common veggies in the area. </p>
<p> With around 95% water-content, they would help keep a person hydrated. That was particularly important on long journeys by foot, where you may or may not have had water supplies along the way. </p>
<p> Another benefit that cucumbers might offer for travel is their anti-inflammatory potential, which certainly could come in handy for those sore and swollen feet! </p>
<p> Lab research suggests an antioxidant in them called fisetin may act as a COX-2 enzyme inhibitor. The prescription drug Celebrex works by helping to block COX-2. </p>
<p> Fisetin has also been researched in the lab for several types of cancer including colon, lung, prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma. Brain protective benefits have also been observed in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. (5) </p>
<p> We will never know the nutrition facts for the cucumbers ate in Jesus’ day, though the modern cultivation of the this vegetable (which is likely less nutritious) still contains a broad array of vitamins and minerals. </p>
<p> A single cucumber (8.25″ long) is only 45 calories, yet it offers you 442 mg of potassium and over 40% of your daily value for vitamin K. Those are just a couple perks of many. (6) </p>
<p> 10. Frankincense and myrrh </p>
<p> You can’t help but associate these with Christmas! </p>
<p> Gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh were brought by the magi (wise men) to celebrate the birth of Jesus. </p>
<p> For his death, the burial as described in John 19:39 involved: </p>
<p> “…Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. Taking Jesus’ body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.” </p>
<p> Commiphora myrrha tree </p>
<p> Both frankincense and myrrh are aromatic gum resins that are produced by closely related trees in the Burseraceae plant family. </p>
<p> The Bible mentions them many times and most often, they are not mentioned together. This suggests they had different purposes. </p>
<p> To be clear, eating them was never mentioned, as they were mentioned for aromatic and ceremonial purposes only. </p>
<p> What can be said is that in Middle Eastern culture it was (and still is) a common practice to eat very small amounts, though primarily for the purpose of traditional medicine. </p>
<p> Chewing them like gum was also done. In the process, you would inevitably ingest some, because unlike a stick of Juicy Fruit, this “gum” is a tar-like sap that will eventually disintegrate in your mouth, if you chew it long enough. </p>
<p> No one can claim that Jesus or even his disciples ate these gums, since there is no documentation of that. If they did though, it would be interesting, given the many medical uses of myrrh being researched and the lab studies involving frankincense and cancer. </p>
<p> 11. Legumes </p>
<p> For this category, what Jesus eats while he was on earth was probably not much different than his Hebrew ancestors ate, and what those in the region eat to this very day. </p>
<p> Lentils, broad beans, and chickpeas are cultivated there and used in soups, stews, and ground into pastes and purees. One of which you certainly recognize – hummus from chickpeas! </p>
<p> When we think of “dipping the bread” we often assume it was olive oil, but that assumption should not be made. </p>
<p> Oil was expensive. </p>
<p> In Biblical times, there would often be a common dish at the meal. Flat, round pieces of bread would be dipped into it. Or the bread would be used to wrap around a small piece of food in that common dish. </p>
<p> That dish could have been lentils, or it could have been a mash of cooked chickpeas (hummus). </p>
<p> Whichever legumes were being eaten by Jesus, those grown in the region all have similar nutritional benefits. </p>
<p> Protein concentration in ground beef is 7.8g per 100 calorie serving. Many beans offer a comparable amount – 6 to 8 grams – for 100 to 120 calories. Best of all, beans have zero cholesterol and lots of fiber. They’re loaded with non-heme iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and thiamin. (7) </p>
<p> 12. Olives </p>
<p> Between the mentions of olive trees and olive oil, you will find this plant mentioned in some capacity over 150 times throughout the Old and New Testaments. </p>
<p> There’s no doubt olives were important. </p>
<p> Not just as a food, but the oil was used for burning in lamps. The wood of the tree also served utility. </p>
<p> And let’s not forget that after the last supper, Jesus prayed under an olive tree on his way to Jerusalem, knowing that he would be crucified shortly thereafter. That took place in the Garden of Gethsemane (literally translates as “Garden of the Oil-press”) located on the western slope of the Mount of Olives. </p>
<p> Oleuropein is a compound that’s unique to olives and it has been found to decrease the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. (8) (9) </p>
<p> Hydroxytyrosol is a major phenol in olives that has demonstrated “excellent antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic activities” in research. (10) (11) </p>
<p> Vitamin E (alpha tocopherol) is prevalent. One tablespoon of olive oil has about 2mg, which is around 13% of your RDA. (12) </p>
<p> Something to keep in mind is that a person of socioeconomic standing like Jesus would be consuming olive oil sparingly. </p>
<p> That was before the days of mechanical farming and machine pressing. Today it’s cheap to produce. </p>
<p> Even though olive oil is cholesterol-free (butter isn’t) and contains more of the healthier monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), it’s not healthy to consume a lot of it. </p>
<p> All refined oils are around 120 calories per tablespoon, meaning weight gain can be a common side effect. </p>
<p> However the bigger issue is that purified fats (i.e. oils) contribute to atherosclerosis, which is stiffening of your arteries. That increases your risk for stroke and heart attacks. (13) </p>
<p> To be clear, fat is good for you but not in liquid form. The solid unrefined fats in pistachios are slow to be digested and therefore, don’t hit your circulatory system all at once. It’s like comparing simple sugars to complex carbs. </p>
<p> The takeaway? Eat the oil like Jesus probably did – sparingly! </p>
<p> 13. Figs </p>
<p> Being that fig leaves were mentioned in Genesis, this plant was known from the beginning of the Bible! </p>
<p> We already mentioned some of the complaints in Numbers 11:5. After escaping slavery in Egypt, the Israelites complained about no longer having fish, cucumbers, and garlic. </p>
<p> A few verses later in Numbers 20:5, they complain about the fruits they no longer have: </p>
<p> “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates.” </p>
<p> Indeed, figs were a useful food to eat. They could be made into raw “cakes” by pressing the fruits together, which served as a form of fast food while on the go. Listen to this preparation of such in 1 Samuel 25:18: </p>
<p> “Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.” </p>
<p> When you skip ahead to 1 Samuel 30, you read about how David used that food to revive an Egyptian who was in pretty bad shape: </p>
<p> “They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat— part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.” </p>
<p> Skipping ahead to the New Testament, we have proof that Jesus ate figs, and presumably, also liked them. Turn to Matthew 21:18 where you will read: </p>
<p> “Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” Immediately the tree withered.” </p>
<p> Jesus had good taste! For antioxidant activity, raw figs have an ORAC value of 3,383. That’s higher than goji berries of the same weight at 3,290. </p>
<p> What did Jesus eat for breakfast? </p>
<p> Based on Matthew 21:18 we know he ate figs in the morning. That is the ideal time of day to eat carbohydrates, because one doesn’t want to spike their blood sugar before bed. In addition to figs, we also know he ate fish and bread, as mentioned on other occasions. </p>
<p> Despite the intense sweetness of figs, they are loaded with fiber and therefore the sugars are slower to hit your bloodstream. </p>
<p> For a few dried fruits (60g) the glycemic index is 61. That makes it a “moderate” glycemic food, which isn’t bad when you consider that it’s sweet enough to serve as a dessert. Eating figs would be a much healthier option than our modern-day processed pies, cakes, and cookies! (14) </p>
<p> 14. Pomegranates </p>
<p> With an origin that’s believed to be somewhere in or around Iran, the pomegranate has been cultivated in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region since ancient times. </p>
<p> At least as far back as the book of Exodus in the Bible, which discussed the making of priestly garments with “pomegranates” of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn. For them to describe a clothing accessory made to look like a fruit, then it’s safe to assume they were also eating them. </p>
<p> This is affirmed in Deuteronomy 8:7, where God describes the promised land he will be giving to his people: </p>
<p> “For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land — a land with brooks, streams, and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills; a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey…” </p>
<p> In the New Testament, the word pomegranate is never mentioned, though it’s practically guaranteed to be among the list of foods Jesus ate. Whether it was Nazareth where he grew up, the towns along the Sea of Galilee, or in Jerusalem, this superfruit was cultivated and consumed throughout the areas Jesus lived and visited. </p>
<p> For total antioxidant content, raw pomegranates have an ORAC value of 4,479. That’s comparable to the 4,669 for blueberries of the same weight. </p>
<p> If Jesus ate one whole pomegranate, it would be providing him with 48% of his daily value for vitamin C and 44% for fiber. There are small yet decent amounts of vitamin B6, potassium, magnesium, and even about 5 grams of protein. (15) </p>
<p> 15. Dates </p>
<p> We saved the sweetest food for last. </p>
<p> Did Jesus eat dates? </p>
<p> Being that he went up to a fig tree when he was hungry one morning, we know that he ate those and anyone who likes figs is almost guaranteed to love dates. </p>
<p> Although this fruit is not mentioned by name in the New Testament, it was cultivated and eaten in the region so it would be a common food that Jesus most likely ate on occasion. </p>
<p> As with figs, they were dried and pressed together to make raw natural “cakes” to eat on the road. You can read about this in 2 Samuel 6:19. After David had placed the ark of the Lord inside of the tent and completed the sacrificial offerings, he sent the people in attendance on their way with some to-go goodies: </p>
<p> “Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes.” </p>
<p> Many are surprised to hear how much antioxidants there are in dates. Here are the ORAC values for two common varieties: </p>
<p> Deglet Noor dates = 3,895 </p>
<p> Medjool dates = 2,387 </p>
<p> Both of those are higher antioxidant activity than the same weight of raw asparagus, boiled broccoli, purple cauliflower, and even lacinato kale! </p>
<p> Of course given their sugar content, the bad news is that even though dates are antioxidant-rich, you should only eat small portions. Unlike say, broccoli and kale, which you can eat unlimited amounts of. </p>
<p> If you use dates as a natural dessert, they will be healthier than cookies or almost any other baked treat. Their impact on blood sugar isn’t as bad as you might think. </p>
<p> United Arab Emirates University took 5 common species of dates found in the region and tested their glycemic index values. They ranged from 46 to 55. Those fall within the “low glycemic” range. Even more surprising, these tests were done using relatively large serving sizes too, ranging from 72.5 to 76.2 grams (over 2.5 ounces). (16) </p>
<p> This is why if you’re a regular reader of Superfoodly, then you already know the number one sweetener we recommend if you want a real sugar (i.e. not stevia). </p>
<p> The best choice you could make would be date sugar. It’s made from dried dates which are then ground into powder. </p>
<p> Even here in Los Angeles, we never see it sold at any store, though you can buy it on Amazon. </p>
<p> FAQs about his diet </p>
<p> Did Jesus eat eggs? </p>
<p> In the Bible, eggs are only mentioned a few times. Most instances are for analogies rather than as an explicit food source for humans. </p>
<p> The very first mention of the word is in Deuteronomy 22:5-7, which says: </p>
<p> “If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young. You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life.” </p>
<p> While God says “you may take the young” that might not include the eggs, because in sentence prior to that it’s made clear that young and eggs are two different things (“mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs”). </p>
<p> The only other verse in the Old Testament that may be interpreted as eggs being food for humans is Isaiah 10:14, which says: </p>
<p> “As one reaches into a nest, so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations; as people gather abandoned eggs, so I gathered all the countries; not one flapped a wing, or opened its mouth to chirp.” </p>
<p> Yes, this verse is an analogy, but it’s sounds to be an analogy about people gathering a potential food source (“as people gather abandoned eggs”). Something interesting to note here is that it says “abandoned” eggs which is quite different than eggs that a mother bird (i.e. modern day chicken) is actively nesting. </p>
<p> This verse actually lends further support to the theory that in Deuteronomy 22:5-7, it distinguishes between taking young vs. taking eggs. </p>
<p> In the New Testament, we only have eggs mentioned once and that is in Luke 11:11-13, which is a parable: </p>
<p> “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” </p>
<p> Matthew reports this parable as a son asking for bread and getting a stone instead (Matthew 7:9-11). </p>
<p> In Luke’s version, a son asking for an egg in the first place suggests he’s asking for it as food. After all, one can’t think of many other reasons why a son would ask his father for an egg, right? </p>
<p> Even if we make the assumption he was asking for it to eat, that still doesn’t explain the source. Based on the Old Testament verses, it might have been an abandoned egg. </p>
<p> There is no evidence to suggest that Jesus did not eat eggs, but at the same, there’s no evidence he did. Jesus never mentions eggs in the Bible. It is not a food specifically mentioned at any meal he was a part of, but that doesn’t exclude their possibility. </p>
<p> The possibility seems likely given that the Code of Jewish Law (Yoreh Deah 87:5) addresses eggs. Eggs are reported as being a neutral food (pareve) which means they are not counted as meat or dairy. Eggs are permissible to eat with meals containing either, but not with both at same time (because meat and dairy together is always prohibited). There is also the egg (beitza) used on the Jewish Passover Seder plate. </p>
<p> Eggs were an expensive food, a delicacy that was enjoyed by the upper-class more than the common man. Luke aside, that might be an explanation as to why they didn’t come up in conversations or descriptions of meals that Jesus would partake in. </p>
<p> Was Jesus a vegetarian? </p>
<p> No. This is a fact since we have Biblical evidence of him eating fish, including after the resurrection in Luke 24:42-43, in which he ate broiled fish to prove he was real and not a ghost. </p>
<p> In Matthew 14:17-21, he also fed the crowds with fish and the bread he multiplied. Some have argued this would be unusual for Jesus to do if he was vegetarian, because why would he give people fish if he didn’t eat it himself? </p>
<p> That is a valid point, though it wouldn’t necessarily be unusual. Today, many vegans and vegetarians are more than happy to feed their house guests eggs and meat even if they don’t personally eat them. It would be silly to say that every food you serve someone, is a food you have to like and eat yourself. </p>
<p> Plus if you pay careful attention to the wording in Matthew 14, you will see the fish is only mentioned at the beginning, as to the limited quantity of food they had on hand (5 loaves of bread and 2 fish). After that, fish is never mentioned, and it’s leftover baskets of bread that are collected (no fish is mentioned). The fish might not have even been multiplied for the crowd. </p>
<p> However this is all a moot point because even setting that debate aside, the bottom line is that we know Jesus ate fish after the resurrection. There are other scenarios too where one can at least make a reasonable assumption he was eating fish, along with others in his presence who were eating them. Therefore, Jesus was not a vegetarian or vegan given the fact that he ate fish. </p>
<p> Did Jesus eat red meat or chicken? </p>
<p> While there is clear evidence that Jesus ate fish, it requires at least some conjecture to claim he ate meats such as beef, chicken, or lamb. </p>
<p> We can likely rule out Jesus eating pork while he was alive on earth, because eating pigs was not kosher. </p>
<p> That doesn’t mean he personally thought it was wrong, right, good or bad for you to eat pork, but rather we know he respected the dietary laws from Hebrew scripture, at the very least out of respect for the others of his time and culture. </p>
<p> Perhaps the best evidence we have that Jesus did not think it was wrong to eat meat was in Mark 7:14-20, in which this is said: </p>
<p> Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.” </p>
<p> After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. “Are you so dull?” he asked. “Don’t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them? For it doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.) </p>
<p> He went on: “What comes out of a person is what defiles them. For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and defile a person.” </p>
<p> However this is not in reference to pork, red meat, chicken, or any other specific food. If you rewind to the start, it’s about the practice of not washing your hands prior to eating, as the law required. </p>
<p> Regardless, it seems Jesus’ focus is on an unclean heart versus unclean hands or what goes into your mouth. </p>
<p> With all that said, just because meat, sugar (honey in his time) and so forth are not “wrong” to eat, that doesn’t mean they’re good for your health, or that they’re the best choice among the vast food options we have today. </p>
<p> In fact, one of the most cited verses against sexual immorality could also be cited in the care of your body in all regards. In 1 Corinthians 6:18-20, Paul says: </p>
<p> “Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.“ </p>
<p> Bold emphasis added. </p>
<p> Perhaps eating unhealthy is not the equivalent of sexual immorality, though both are dishonorable to your body, which as stated above, are temples of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p> This is particularly true on a longer-term basis. If you make destructive dietary decisions on a daily basis, imagine the strife and sorrow it you may cause your family, friends, and loved ones if such decisions result in type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and a premature death? </p>
<p> Just as sexual immorality is dangerous and destructive, food can be too in a different way. What they have in common is that they both disrespect your body and possibly cause others to suffer. </p>
<p> Even though it’s not evil or wrong to eat meat and chicken loaded with cholesterol and cancer-causing heterocyclic amines, one has to admit that a vegan or vegetarian has a point if they say they don’t eat these foods out of respect for their bodies. </p>
<p> On the flip side, if a vegan is going around eating processed junk food all the time, then he or she is being a hypocrite, if they cite health and respect for their bodies as the reason for not eating meat, dairy, and eggs. </p>
<p> In the same way, a pastor who rails against people he or she believes to be sexually immoral is being a hypocrite, if that pastor is overweight and eating unhealthy food regularly. </p>
<p> Both are acts of disrespecting the body, which is a temple of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p> We digress though. Getting back to the topic of whether or not Jesus ate meat aside from the fish… </p>
<p> Vegetarian diets were not unusual in the early history of the Christian and Catholic faiths. St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom, and St. Francis of Assisi were all vegetarian. </p>
<p> In the Old Testament, there is even compelling evidence that Daniel was vegetarian or vegan. He refused to eat the meat offered to him while in prison. The assumption has been made that it was because the meat was offered to Babylonian gods. Yet the vegetables were also offered to the gods and Daniel ate those! </p>
<p> Furthermore, Daniel even recommended the adaption of a vegetarian diet in Daniel 1:11-16, touting the health benefits of doing so: </p>
<p> Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over him: “Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see.” So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days. At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food. So the guard took away their meat and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead. </p>
<p> So that was before Jesus was born. Is it possible Jesus followed a diet similar to Daniel? </p>
<p> If Jesus was a member of the Nazarene Essenes, it was a Jewish sect that rejected the animal sacrifices and followed a vegetarian diet. Although that remains speculation, there are historians who adamantly believe Jesus was of this sect. </p>
<p> Not cutting hair is another practice of the Essenes. If you believe the Shroud of Turin is real, analysis of that suggests long hair was wrapped in it. </p>
<p> The King James version does mention Jesus eating meat in a couple verses, though if you look at the Greek word it was translated from, it’s “broma” which only means food generically. So that may or may not have been meat. </p>
<p> Jesus did participate in Passover feasts and other celebrations, where it’s almost certain that lamb and red meat was present. The assumption might be made that Jesus ate all of the foods there, though this too may be incorrect. As we all know, for any number of reasons, you may or may not eat everything available at a dinner party. </p>
<p> In can be theorized that there’s a good chance Jesus ate red meat like lamb and white meat like chicken and other fowl, yet the possibility remains that he might have been a pesco-vegetarian. Technically that is not a vegetarian diet, as it still involves fish, which is meat by most definitions. </p>
<p> At the end of the day, topics such as this are fascinating to study, yet one should not allow the diet of Jesus to serve as grounds for disagreements and disputes. What he ate is the least important thing, at least relative to his message! </p>

<p> What do Bats Eat? </p>
<p> What do Bats Eat? </p>
<p> If you’ve ever wondered what do bats eat, you might be surprised. The diet of bats varies greatly depending on the species and the environment. Most species of bats are carnivorous, and specialize in eating insects. Insect-eating bats are the most common bats experienced in the United States. Areas with high concentrations of mosquitoes and other flying pests attract bat populations. Bats can eat between 2,000 – 3,000 insects a night. They are capable of catching insects in midflight, as well as on the ground. Bats hunt at night, and locate their food using echolocation, which involves sensing the rebound of high-pitched squeaks, much like a radar system. </p>
<p> Some bats have evolved to eat smaller vertebrate animals, such as mice, fish, lizards, and frogs. However, none of these bats live in the United States. There are only three species of bats that drink the blood of hosts, and they all live in South America. </p>
<p> Several of the larger species of bats have evolved to eat fruit and drink the nectar of flowers. Nectar feeding bats have adapted to the flowers of cacti, and can be found on the Texas-Arizona border. They are capable of hovering in front of a plant, much like a hummingbird, and have long tongues that are able to reach deep into flowers. Fruit eating bats, such as the flying fox, are found only in the tropics. </p>

<p> What Do Black Bears Eat? </p>
<p> Black bears have a varied diet that includes many types of food. In this article, we look at what makes up the diet of a black bear. </p>
<p> Black bears eat a variety of foods to supplement their dietary requirements. These include other mammals, plants, fruits, nuts, berries, fish, insects, birds, eggs, reptiles, and amphibians. </p>
<p> There are three bear species in North America, the American black bear, the brown ‘grizzly’ bear, and the polar bear. All three species of bear eat a varied diet from the other two. Here we discuss the diet of the American black bear. </p>
<p> What Do Black Bears Eat? </p>
<p> American black bears can spend over half of the year, up to seven months, hibernating every year. To survive during the winter, they must make sure that they build their fat reserves for the rest of the year. Without these fat reserves, it would make it impossible to make it through the winter. </p>
<p> Black bears have a huge appetite in the warmer months when they are not hibernating. In these months, they spend almost all of their time eating, traveling, and sleeping. </p>
<p> Due to the long hibernation period, American black bears prefer foods that are high in fat, sugar, and protein. Black bears are classified as carnivores. </p>
<p> However, the American black bear does have a varied diet. Although this includes large ungulates such as caribou, deer, elk, moose, and wapiti, it is also made up of plant matter and fruits. </p>
<p> Black bears will also eat many different species of fish, along with birds and eggs. They will also eat various types of insects, including bees and wasps. </p>
<p> Mammals </p>
<p> Black bears are carnivores and will eat young caribou, deer, elk, and moose. </p>
<p> Black bears will remember where ungulates such as deer and elk have given birth, deliberately hunting in those areas year after year. In other areas, the bears will come across the young whilst traveling. </p>
<p> The number of young eaten by black bears can be significant in some areas of the country. </p>
<p> Black bears can also take down large hoofed mammals such as caribou, moose, or elk but will generally only do so if they have been weakened or injured. A black bear does not want to risk injury to itself before the long hibernation. </p>
<p> The geographic location and the habitat plays a big part in which other animals black bears will eat. </p>
<p> In some polar areas, black bears feed mostly on larger animals for the increased protein. In these colder areas, such as Northern Labrador, the black bears will take down fully grown caribou, deer, and moose. </p>
<p> Other animals that black bears eat include beavers, bobcats, coyotes, ground squirrels, mice, red foxes, voles, and wolves. </p>
<p> American black bears will also feed on carrion left behind by other species, chasing the other animals away from a kill. </p>
<p> In spring, black bears may dig small mammals such as gophers from their burrows. However, there is usually much larger animals that are easier to find. </p>
<p> Black bears may also find an abundance of animals that have not survived the long, cold winter. Old or weakened animals such as caribou, deer, elk, and moose that have died during the freezing season are left for the bears to feed on in spring. </p>
<p> The protein-rich carcasses can greatly help a bear that has been in hibernation throughout the winter. </p>
<p> Plants </p>
<p> Although black bears supplement their diet with meat, up to 90% of their diet is vegetarian. Whereas ungulates such as cows, elk, and whitetail deer have a specialized stomach that can efficiently break down the plant matter, the black bear does not. </p>
<p> Ungulates have a long digestive tract, made up of four sections in the stomach. Each of these sections has its function with specialized bacteria that help to break the material down. </p>
<p> Black bears only have a one-chambered stomach, unlike the four-chambered ungulates. However, although it is not as functional when breaking down the plant material, their digestive tract is very long. </p>
<p> This lengthened digestive tract allows the black bears to pull extra nutrition from plants. Black bears will eat plants when they are the most nutritious and tender to them. </p>
<p> Plants such as alfalfa, clover, and dandelions are all broad-leafed and soft for the bears to digest. Flowers and roots are also eaten in large quantities, although they do not like to expend energy digging for the roots. </p>
<p> Plants are an essential part of the nutritional diet when the black bear wakes up from hibernation. Coinciding with the end of hibernation, new shoots and plants begin to grow in the spring, after the long winter. </p>
<p> These new plants are soft and easy to digest for the re-emerging bear. After hibernation, a black bear’s stomach takes a few weeks to start working properly again. </p>
<p> During the summer, bears will eat flowering plants such as Lillies and fireweed to supplement their nutrition. </p>
<p> Berries and Fruit </p>
<p> Black bears also eat berries and fruits, which are all important to vary the bear’s diet. Fruit eaten by bears includes apples, blackberries, cherries, elderberries, huckleberries, plums, raspberries, and rose hips. </p>
<p> Raspberries and other blackberries become ripe early in the year, allowing the bear to eat them before moving onto other fruit that ripens later. Black bears can decimate a farmer’s crop of berries, with some eating more than 30,000 a year. </p>
<p> Black bears also eat various nuts, and they will peel these from the cones of deciduous and evergreen trees. Hazelnuts are one of the favorite types of nuts for a bear, with some bears traveling considerable distances to reach a harvest of nuts. </p>
<p> With the black bear being able to climb, this gives them an advantage over creatures that can not. </p>
<p> Insects </p>
<p> As well as feeding on animals, American black bears also feed on many other foods to supplement their diet. Black bears eat a large range of insects and worms. These include ants, grubs, grasshoppers, beetle larvae, moths, caterpillars, and earthworms. Black bears have a sticky tongue that is used to watch insects. </p>
<p> Ants are an important food source for bears, as they are high in protein. When fruit and berries are low, ants are eaten in great quantities. Black bears will eat ants, along with the young in pupal and larval stages. </p>
<p> They will also feed on bees and wasps. Many people believe that bears feed on honey, and this is correct. However, they mostly raid the beehives for the bees themselves, along with the larvae. </p>
<p> Birds and Eggs </p>
<p> Black bears will eat various bird species, including ducks, geese, and grouse. American black bears will also feed on the eggs of birds. Being adept at climbing trees, the black bears can find the eggs in the nests and the newly hatched birds too young to escape. However, they generally take most of the eggs and young chicks from the nest of ground-nesting birds. </p>
<p> Cannibalism </p>
<p> They may also indulge in cannibalism, eating young black bears and adult female bears in some areas. Large adult males mainly carry out cannibalism. </p>
<p> Although classified as carnivores, plants and fruit make up most of its diet. Whereas other predators such as foxes, mountain lions, and wolves feed many on meat, black bears get up to 90% of their nutrition from plant material. </p>
<p> Reptiles and Amphibians </p>
<p> In the south of the country, such as Louisiana and Florida, bears may also feed on alligators. Although they do not want to risk injury from a full-grown alligator, they will raid the nests for the young and the unhatched eggs. </p>
<p> Black bears also eat some reptiles and amphibians, such as frogs, although this makes up a small portion of their diet. </p>
<p> Fish </p>
<p> American black bears will also feed on various types of fish, depending on the geographical location. Black bears along the Western Pacific Coast need the supply of salmon spawning in the area to make up their diet. </p>
<p> Other types of fish include trout, which swim further inland in streams. Hungry black bears can easily catch Shallow-water species of fish such as carp and catfish. </p>

<p> What Do Fruit Bats Eat </p>
<p> By Janhvi Johorey, Psychologist specialized in animal therapy. Updated: March 31, 2020 </p>
<p> The Fruit Bat is a Megabat, also known in some parts of the world as the Flying Fox. These bats differ in sizes depending on their habitat. Some fruit bats are not more than 2 inches in size whilst others measure 16" in length. Some of these bats weigh an ounce or two while others, a couple of ounces. If you have found an injured Fruit Bat and need to take care of it or are simply curious about this flying mammal's habits you may ask yourself : “What Do Fruit Bats Eat?” This AnimalWised article will attempt to answer that query and provide you with fun facts about not only their diet but their habitat, distribution, and features of these furry flyers. </p>
<p> An anatomy prepared for survival </p>
<p> The Fruit Bat has an amazing overall vision. This is essential for it to use along with its sense of smell to locate food sources. Its senses serve to help them walk away from difficult situations. The Fruit Bat is also equipped with sharp incisors and teeth types to break through the skin of the fruit. Their long tongues unroll when they feed on fruits and nectar, then roll back up and remain within the mouth rather than internally around the rib cage. They are batty about fruits, by the way. This is why they are called Fruit Bats. </p>
<p> Fruits For The Furry Flyer </p>
<p> The Fruit Bats thrive successfully especially in Egypt. They live in areas where there is plenty of food. Thick regions with forested expanses covered in fruits are a common place to find these creatures. Many Fruit Bats live in warm climes with tropical features, because fruits grow throughout the year here, as many fruit Bats have to travel long distances during certain times to find fruits at certain times of the year. </p>
<p> Fruit Bats may be called Flying Foxes, but they are nothing like foxes. Foxes hunt for meat and mammals. However, fruit Bats have a serious taste for all types of fruits ranging from bananas to mangos, dates, avocados, wild dates and any type of pulpy fruit. Just about every kind of fruit is good for these bats. However, they will avoid any fruit that is very bright in color and have a strong smell. </p>
<p> They can also eat unripe, insect impacted fruit as well. This makes them survive in surroundings where fresh, ripe fruit may not be available. </p>
<p> Fruit bats can also be seen eating small insects, just like regular bats. However, also eating fruit is considered an evolutionary advance. Consuming a different type of food other than insects ensures their survival because if there are not enough insects around, the Fruit Bat can still make it. The evolution process through which this bat has emerged is thought to be extremely complex, therefore. </p>
<p> Finding the Food </p>
<p> Fruit bats do not spend time in caves or caverns, like other bats. Instead, they hang from fruit producing trees, such as mango and banana trees. Daily activity of these bats involves looking for food. </p>
<p> Fruit Bats use both smell and vision to find food. Hundreds of different types of fruits grow on trees and plants the bat is able to consume. Fruit bats either linger in the air and eat or land in order to eat their food. The larger they are in size, the tougher it is for them to eat the fruit without landing, in mid-air. </p>
<p> Although people commonly think they will eat the whole fruit, this isn't so. Once the bats crush into the fruit using their teeth, they consume their pulp and juices. They can also feed on a fruit tree's nectar, which is found in fruit blossoms. Their eating habits are benefiting the environment on account of cross-pollination qualities. As they chew in the fruit, they will usually spit out the seeds, which is how many of these fruit plants spread. Moreover, grains of pollen are caught in the fur and some of this rubs on to other flowers visited by the bat. The bat, therefore, pollinates the flowers, permitting trees to develop seeds and fruits. </p>
<p> The fruit bat's environment </p>
<p> Fruit Bats are found not only in Africa and Asia but also the Middle East and Australia. These bats live in colonies of different sizes. These Fruit Bats believe strength is in numbers and they reside in large colonies. Within each colony of the Fruit Bat, there are sub-colonies. Each has one male and around 8 females. They form close bonds with subgroups. The colony communicates throughout the day. Bats use visual orientation and echolocation to study and move around in their environment. Female Fruit Bats carry their young till they are 3 months old, during which time they will also feed their baby while in search for food too. </p>
<p> The Fruit Bat is an unusual species and is considered a rare example of evolution to meet the survival needs of the genus. </p>

<p> What Do Macaws Eat? </p>
<p> Usually, whenever someone brings up the subject of raising and caring for a Macaw, they tend to bring up their diet and what you should feed them before anything else. Considering food is such a vital area to any creature, it makes sense why this is such a crucial area for people to look at. With this in mind, what do Macaws eat? </p>
<p> To answer this question…Macaws are omnivores, meaning they eat vegetables, fruit, and meat, just like most humans do. However, what they eat tends to vary if they’re in captivity or in the wild, but for the most part, they eat a lot of the same foods either way. </p>
<p> It’s always fascinating what any creature eats, especially when compared to them being in captivity and when they’re in the wild. Nevertheless, down below, we’re going to discuss what Macaws eat in captivity and what they eat in the wild. That way, you have a wide range of information available for what they eat. Let’s take a look! </p>
<p> What do Macaws Eat in Captivity? </p>
<p> Considering most of you are probably more interested in learning what you can feed your Macaw, we’ll highlight what they eat in captivity before anything else. Remember, every Macaw varies slightly with their preference, so be mindful of what they do and don’t like. </p>
<p> Still, if you follow this list, you should be golden when giving them an overall healthy diet. This isn’t necessarily a recommendation list, but an excellent broad list regarding what they eat and what you should consider feeding them. Nevertheless, let’s take a look! </p>
<p> Vegetables </p>
<p> As with any other creature, vegetables go a long way with the overall longevity of their life. Considering we all want our respective parrots to be here as long as possible, vegetables are a great way to feed them essential vitamins and nutrients right in their food. </p>
<p> Some essential vegetables for Macaws include broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, endive, carrot, pumpkin, artichoke, kale, sweet potato, green bean, and beetroot. All of these vegetables should be great for Macaws, and if there’s a vegetable you’re not sure your Macaw can eat, don’t be afraid to check online to see if it’s okay for them. </p>
<p> Fruit </p>
<p> Right next to vegetables, you have the magnificent world of fruit. Considering fruit is such a tasty food subject, it’s even better to know that fruit is extremely good for you and your parrot’s health. Plus, parrots tend to love fruit, as long as it’s okay for them to eat. </p>
<p> Fruit to consider feeding your Macaw includes apples (without seeds/stem), apricots, peaches, cherries, coconut, nectarines, pomegranates, papaya, mangoes, berries, grapes, kiwi, melon, peeled pineapples, peeled bananas, plums, oranges, and star fruit. As with vegetables, if you’re interested to see if a specific fruit is okay for them to eat, make sure you check online or with their vet first. </p>
<p> Nuts </p>
<p> Unlike vegetables and fruit, the subject of nuts tends to be a bit broader as there are a lot more options than the nut itself. For example, a nut can have salt, oil, additional flavors, and much more. For the most part, make sure whatever nut you end up feeding your Macaw is salt-free and raw, meaning it’s not prepared in any way. </p>
<p> Nuts that are okay for Macaws to eat include almonds, brazil nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, shelled peanuts, pistachios, pecans, and cashews. As you can tell, there are several nuts that are great for Macaw, but as always, be mindful of what you’re feeding them is okay. </p>
<p> Seeds </p>
<p> Although not as discussed as fruit and vegetables, seeds can make a decent portion of a Macaw’s diet. Seeds are not only comfortable for parrots of all species to eat, but they’re high in protein, making them a relatively healthy option to consider feeding them. </p>
<p> Seeds to consider feeding your Macaw include safflower, millets, oats, buckwheat, and canary seeds. Make sure you don’t feed your Macaw sunflower seeds as they’re incredibly high in fat and can be a negative for their overall health. </p>
<p> Pellets </p>
<p> If you were to seek out a bag of Macaw food, it would more than likely be a conglomeration of pellets with seeds. If you’re wondering why this is the case, pellets are extremely easy to manufacture and are inexpensive and relatively healthy for Macaws to consume. </p>
<p> There are plenty of brands out there for Macaw pellets, but whatever you end up going with, make sure it’s inexpensive and appropriate for your Macaw to eat. Also, be mindful of how much you’re feeding them since it can be straightforward to not feed your Macaw the correct amount of food. </p>
<p> Egg </p>
<p> Although it might sound odd to feed your Macaw eggs, the standard eggs you’d find in the grocery store are actually extremely healthy for Macaws to eat. Still, make sure you feed them eggs in moderation, as too much of anything can be unbelievably bad for their overall health. </p>
<p> Some people will give the egg completely raw for their parrot to consume, even the eggshell. Whereas others will prepare the eggs for them by scrambling them, but either option will suffice. Just make sure if you do end up preparing them that you’re not using too much oil or butter. </p>
<p> Fish </p>
<p> Like eggs, fish is a prevalent dish to feed your parrot, as it can do wonders for their overall health. Of course, make sure how you prepare them the fish is okay for them to consume, as they shouldn’t eat breaded or deep-fried fish like so many humans do. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, consider feeding your parrot baked, poached, broiled, or steamed fish for your parrot. Don’t get too exotic with the fish you end up feeding them, as any of the standard fish you’d see at a restaurant should more than be okay for them to consume. </p>
<p> Poultry </p>
<p> It’s no secret that most humans love chicken, and besides humans, chicken is actually great for parrots to eat too. It’s high in protein and can be prepared in such a way where it’s relatively healthy for them to consume. Still, be mindful of what you’re feeding them chicken-wise, since too much of it can be bad for them. </p>
<p> As for how you should prepare chicken for them, stick to chicken breast and make sure there’s nothing added to it like salt or a breaded covering. Keep it simple and bake it if you want, but remember to not add a lot of oil or anything harmful as it can be hazardous for them to consume. </p>
<p> What do Macaws Eat in the Wild? </p>
<p> As great as it is to make sure our Macaws get all of the food they’ll need while raising them, there are even more Macaws in the wild who need to eat on their own. In some cases, the wild isn’t too difficult of a life for them as they have a large food supply. </p>
<p> Whereas, in some circumstances, if where they’re living is depleted of its resources, they may have a more challenging time trying to find all of the food they’ll need. Nevertheless, let’s take a look at what Macaws eat in the wild and where there are some similarities and differences. </p>
<p> Fruit </p>
<p> Just like Macaws eat fruit in captivity, the same can be said when they’re in the wild. Keep in mind, they don’t have access to the wide range of fruits we have at home, but they still do their best to find a wide range of fruit to eat. Wild fruit choices typically include grapes, plums, and berries. </p>
<p> Seeds </p>
<p> Again, similar to being in captivity, seeds are a significant makeup of a Macaw’s diet, especially when they’re looking for something fulfilling to eat. The seeds can be anything from plants, vegetables, fruit, and much more. As long as the seeds are present, expect a Macaw to come by and eat them up. </p>
<p> Flowers </p>
<p> Unlike being in captivity, it’s widespread for Macaws to munch on flowers in the wild. Whenever they don’t have a more abundant food source like fruit or seeds at their disposal, they tend to eat flowers as a replacement when they’re really hungry. </p>
<p> Flowers Macaws eat in the wild include Violets, Sunflowers, Sage, Thyme, Elderberry, Daises, Hibiscus, and much more. Now, don’t get out in your backyard to find flowers for your Macaw. Instead, realize flowers are an essential part of their diet when they’re in the wild roaming around. </p>
<p> Corn </p>
<p> Macaw-owners tend to not cook up corn for their Macaw to eat, but if there happens to be wild corn, a Macaw will gladly eat it up while they’re in the wild. Corn is very easy for them to consume, making it easy-picking for them to eat and get a decent meal from. However, corn isn’t their most preferred food, generally speaking. </p>
<p> Insects </p>
<p> Yes, you read that, parrots love insects. Although most Macaw-owners wouldn’t dare feed their Macaw an endless supply of insects, wild Macaws disagree. Plus, insects can be relatively healthy for them as they are high in protein and make for easy food to consume. </p>

<p> What do Ocean Fish Eat </p>
<p> The diets of ocean fish can be a little bit of a mystery, so we took a closer look at eight of the most common ocean fish types to discover what they eat </p>
<p> One of the most popular questions people ask is, “What do ocean fish eat?” The answer is more complicated than you think. There is a diverse variety of fish in the ocean that eat small crustaceans, like krill, crab, barnacle, prawn, shrimp, lobster, etc. to large mollusks and invertebrates. Other foods that fish eat include small fish, seals, sea lions, and certain sharks had been seen attacking whales. An individual fish normally has a very varied diet. </p>
<p> The way in which different species eat is also quite varied. Smaller species usually engulf their prey as a whole unit, while certain medium-sized species will eat their prey by tearing them into small chunks. Most large species of fish and sea mammals perform filter feeding. </p>
<p> In this article, I will discuss various well-known fish species and what they eat in the ocean. </p>
<p> What do Sharks Eat? </p>
<p> What a shark eats varies significantly among the different species. However, the most commonly consumed animals include mollusks, crustaceans, fish, etc. They can also consume marine mammals like porpoises, sea lions, seals, dolphins, as well as some large species of fish including mackerel, tuna, or even small whales. </p>
<p> Although sharks can eat any type of sea creature, different shark species often have their own prey preferences. For instance, tiger sharks like to eat turtles, while hammerhead sharks feed mostly on rays. Blue sharks, on the other hand, love to eat squid. These sharks either engulf the prey as a whole, or they tear it into large chunks with the help of their razor-sharp teeth in the case of a Great White. </p>
<p> Some large species of shark prefer plankton to meat. Yes, you have read this correctly! Whale’s, basking sharks, and megamouth sharks are just some examples of sharks who prefer plankton to meat. Plankton eating sharks have small teeth and they also don’t use them in the feeding process as they filter feed. </p>
<p> What do Rays Eat? </p>
<p> Rays are widely distributed throughout the globe. Most of them live at the bottom of the sea, while some are found near the shore. Rays are carnivores in terms of diet and feed on a variety of sea creatures. However, the way they look for food and their prey varies according to species. </p>
<p> Small species have rounded teeth that feed on snails, clams, oysters, and crustaceans. Large species, like manta rays are mostly filter feeders. Some of them actively prey on bottom-dwelling crustaceans and small fish. Most of them have a sting at the base of their tail and some of them have developed special ways of catching their prey. For example, electric rays use electricity to stun their prey. </p>
<p> What do Snappers Eat? </p>
<p> There are more than a hundred species of snapper in the world. They normally live near shores with coral reefs and in tropical areas. There is not much of a size difference when you compare the various species of snapper. Examples of snapper species include dog snappers, emperor snappers, yellowtail snappers, gray snappers, and bluefish (which is the most famous member of the snapper family). </p>
<p> Like most fish, snappers are carnivores when it comes to their diet. Young snappers are understandably small and feed mostly on plankton. Adult snappers are hunters and their diet consists of crustaceans, mollusks, and small fish. Because they live near rocky areas, their diet is very varied. </p>
<p> Diet of The Scorpionfish. </p>
<p> Scorpionfish have feathery fins that range in color from dull shades to bright hues, depending on the species. Their fins have venomous glands covered in mucous that can stun prey. </p>
<p> Most scorpionfish are bottom dwellers of shallow water and certain species have been known to live as deep as two kilometers to the ocean floor. </p>
<p> As described previously, scorpionfish are omnivores, so their diet is very varied. They prey on small fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and other bottom-dwelling creatures. </p>
<p> What do Bass Eat? </p>
<p> The term bass normally refers to a large number of fish which encompasses three different genera. However, they all belong to the common order of the perciform. Bass have a wide range of habitats and although they are largely marine species, some are freshwater species. </p>
<p> With their varied habitat, they feed on a wide variety of food. Although they are omnivores, many of the scientists consider them to be opportunistic hunters. They eat plankton, small fish and even vegetation. </p>
<p> What do Clownfish Eat? </p>
<p> Clownfish (or the Anemonefish) is one of the most charming species of marine fish. It is well known for its synergistic partner, the anemone. Some people mistakenly believe that clownfish can’t survive without an anemone, but this has not been proven. </p>
<p> Clownfish are omnivores in their diet behavior and ones living in aquariums enjoy eating processed food. Most clownfish eat sea plants and small sea animals in the ocean. Sometimes they will eat the residue left behind from their partnering anemone, but their diet consists mostly of zooplankton. </p>
<p> Diet of The Hawkfish. </p>
<p> Hawkfish do not have a swim bladder so they try and avoid deep water and are mostly found in coral reefs near the shoreline. Hawkfish have bright colors and sometimes one or two lateral stripes. Hawkfish are so-called due to their hunting techniques, which are very similar to that of a hawk. They wait for their prey on the upper surface of the coral reef and as soon as their prey appears, they dive and pounce on their prey, just like a hawk. They eat mostly plankton, crustaceans, mollusks, and small fish in the ocean. </p>
<p> What do Lionfish Eat? </p>
<p> The lionfish is an exceptionally beautiful fish with long coarse spines all over its body. Zebrafish, fire fish, turkey fish, tasty fish, and butterfish are some other common names for this fish. Their spines are venomous and they use these to kill prey. </p>
<p> Their diet is carnivorous and they hunt nocturnally (normally at dawn and dusk). The primary source of food for this species includes small fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and invertebrates. Cannibalism of smaller members of the same species has been identified in this fish. </p>
<p> Although I can’t describe the food and feeding behavior of every fish species, I have tried to include information on the most popular species in the ocean. </p>
<p> Generally speaking, fish are willing to eat any creature that cannot attack them. </p>

<p> What Do Painted Turtles Eat ? </p>
<p> I recently just got my first painted turtle, and in order to take proper care of him I decided to do as much research as possible. One of the first things that I had to know is what painted turtles eat. So I started my research with this, here is what I found out. </p>
<p> What do painted turtles eat? Painted turtles are omnivorous, this means that they will eat fruits, vegetables as well as meat. Here is a list of what painted turtles will normally eat: </p>
<p> Painted turtles will eat a lot of things. But they will prefer some things over others, and of course terms like meat, fish, fruits and vegetables are a little vague. So let’s take a closer look at what exactly painted turtles should eat, and what they should avoid. </p>
<p> What Kind of Meat Painted Turtles Should Eat </p>
<p> Painted turtles can eat every kind of meat there is. As long as the meat is not spoiled they can eat it without any problem.So if you can eat a certain type of meat without any problem, so can your turtle. </p>
<p> Turtles can also eat cooked as well as uncooked meat without any problem. In the wild they don’t get the chance to eat cooked meat so they mainly rely on raw meat. But cooked meat presents no problem to them. </p>
<p> I personally try to avoid giving my turtle too much raw meat because it can contain bacterias that can be harmful. But besides that turtles should have no problem with it. </p>
<p> What Kind of Fishes Should Painted Turtles Eat </p>
<p> Painted turtles will usually eat any fish that they can catch, so they don’t usually care what kind of fish it is. But in general they will eat smaller fishes that are easier to catch, and won’t put up too much of a fight. </p>
<p> One thing that you have to keep in mind when feeding your painted turtle fish is that they should always come from a pet store, and not from a lake, or a pond. Wild fishes can contain bacterias to which par turtles are not used to, and as a result they will have health problems. </p>
<p> Here is a list of feeder fishes that you should avoid: </p>
<p> Rosy Red minnows </p>
<p> Carp </p>
<p> Guppies </p>
<p> What Kind of Fruits Should Painted Turtles Eat </p>
<p> Most fruits are beneficial for painted turtles, but there are a few exceptions. Those exceptions are citruses, and fruits with a lot of potassium. Citruses contain citric acid which can irritate the stomach of the turtle, and fruits with high potassium are not healthy for the shell. </p>
<p> If you want a list of fruits that you should avoid, you should read this article: Can Turtles Eat Fruits? ( with Pictures and Videos ), after you are done with this one. </p>
<p> What Kind of Vegetables Should Turtles Eat </p>
<p> Most vegetables are also beneficial for painted turtles. But just like with the fruits, there are a few that you should avoid. Mainly vegetables with little to no nutritional value, like iceberg salad. And vegetables that contain oxalates. Oxalates will interfere with calcium absorption which can result in a lot of health problems. </p>
<p> Here is a list of a few common vegetables that contain high doses of oxalates: </p>
<p> Beetroot </p>
<p> Rhubarb </p>
<p> What Kind of Insects Should Painted Turtles Eat </p>
<p> The best way to feed your painted turtle insects, is to give it dried insects. The most popular dried insects that you will find are usually dried crickets. Dried crickets are great for painted turtles because they contain a lot of protein and very little fat. </p>
<p> I haven’t tried any other types of insects besides crickets for my turtle, but from what I’ve seen he seems to enjoy them. Here is a link to the dried crickets that I use to feed my turtle, in case you want to try it. </p>
<p> What Kind of Water Plants Should Turtles Eat </p>
<p> Painted turtles will basically eat any kind of water plant. Until know I bought one water lettuce and some anacharis. Initially I bought them as decorations, but in two weeks my turtle ate them. All aquatic plants that you can find at the pet shop are good for your turtle. Just don’t expect them to look nice for more than a couple of days. </p>
<p> What Kind of Pellets Should Painted Turtles Eat </p>
<p> Most pellets that are labeled for turtles are good, but so are a lot of fish pellets. They contain more or less the same things. A good pellet should contain a good amount of proteins, usually between 25% and 30%. </p>
<p> With my turtle I tried to keep things a little diversified so I choose to occasionally switch different types of pellets. So I usually give him Zoo Med Natural Aquatic Turtle Food and Mazuri Aquatic Turtle Diet. Both of them have really good nutrition values for turtles and my turtles like them both. And the fact that both of them come from trusted brands is a plus. </p>
<p> What Kind of Food Painted Turtles Prefer </p>
<p> With so many choices available it’s hard to know what turtles actually prefer. So I decided to set up a little experiment to see which food my painted turtle prefers. </p>
<p> I created 7 small piles, each one containing a different type of food. One had one type of pellets, another had a another type of pellets, one had Insects, one had cooked chicken, other raw chicken, one had vegetables, and another had fruits. </p>
<p> After placing my turtle at equal distance from each pile, I watched to see in which order he will go after each. After running this experiment for 10 consecutive days I had the results. </p>
<p> My painted turtle always went after the different types of meat, and the insects first. Those three were very closely tied so I placed all of them on the first place. The most popular second choice were the pellets. And finally the fruits and the vegetables in no particular order. </p>
<p> I also did this experiment with other turtle species and the results were mostly the same. </p>
<p> What Painted Turtles Eat in the Wild </p>
<p> In the wild painted turtles will eat the same things as a pet turtle. The only difference is that they won’t get to encounter food pellets, and cooked meat in the wild. </p>
<p> The major difference is that they are limited to what they can find to eat, not to what somebody gives them. When it comes to meat they will mostly rely on on small insects, occasionally fishes, if the can catch them, and any kind of meat that they manage to scavenge. </p>
<p> The same goes for fruits and vegetables, if they are able to find some, they will eat them. </p>
<p> The most abundant food sources is probably insects and water plants. Most lakes, ponds and rivers are full of water plants. And insects are basically everywhere, so there is no shortage, especially in areas with a dense vegetation, like the ones where painted turtles live. </p>
<p> What Baby Painted Turtle Eat </p>
<p> Baby painted turtles eat the same things as adult painted turtles. The only difference is that baby and juvenile turtles prefer to eat more meat than adult turtles. Even if they are omnivorous as a species, babies and juveniles are basically carnivorous. </p>
<p> Baby painted turtles will eat more meat not because they like it more than they like fruits or vegetables, but because they need it to grow faster. So more or less they have to eat meat, since plants won’t help them too much. </p>
<p> If you want to your painted turtle to have a good and balanced diet, I would recommend you to check out this article where I, and the rest of the members of Turtleowner.com, choose the best turtle food on the market: Buyer’s Guide: Best Turtle Food </p>
<p> Related Questions </p>
<p> How long do painted turtles live? As pets painted turtle live between 40 and 50 years. But in the wild where they are faced with a lot of challenges, and don’t have access to very good conditions they usually live between 25 and 30 years. </p>
<p> Do painted turtles make good pets? Yes, painted turtles are excellent pets, especially for beginners. COmpared to other turtle species, painted turtles are very hardy, and they won’t be affected very early if you make any mistake when taking care of them. </p>
<p> Do painted turtles bite? Painted turtles can bite, just like all turtles can. But in general they are not aggressive, so unless you give them a reason to bite you, they won’t do it. </p>

<p> Are you curious about “what do giant pandas eat?” Then, this article will answer your simple question. Additionally, you will get to know more about the other food that a panda can eat. </p>
<p> Keep on reading to learn more! </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> What Does A Giant Panda Eat? </p>
<p> The entire diet of giant pandas totally depends on bamboo, and it won’t be wrong to say that 99% of the giant pandas’ diet is bamboo. However, there are different species of bamboo in the forests. </p>
<p> Giant pandas do not eat every species of bamboo, but the most likeable species for pandas are water bamboo, arrow bamboo, black bamboo, and about 20 more other species. Among bamboo, pandas like to eat leaves, shoots, and roots. </p>
<p> Moreover, the eating habits of giant pandas change with the seasons. During the spring season, they like to eat different kinds of shoots, while in autumn, their entire diet depends on the leaves of bamboo. However, in the winter season, they mainly eat roots. </p>
<p> Giant pandas usually eat 23 to 40 Kg of bamboo every day. It is because of the very little nutritional value in bamboo. So, they eat a lot to meet their daily energy needs. </p>
<p> What Do Giant Pandas Eat Besides Bamboo? </p>
<p> Giant pandas not only eat bamboo, but there are other plants and foods that giant pandas eat like vines, apples, green corn, and much more. </p>
<p> The following are the giant panda facts you need to know for understanding the diet of giant pandas: </p>
<p> Giant Pandas Eat Fruit </p>
<p> The interesting fact about the diet of giant pandas is that they also like to eat fruits. Not all giant pandas eat fruits, but it is true that captive pandas like to eat fruits like apples. </p>
<p> Not only this, but most of the captive pandas also like to eat steamed cornbread and panda cakes. However, during the summer season, the diet of captive pandas is ice mixed with the apples to cool them down. </p>
<p> When it comes to the nutrition of giant pandas, great care is required to make sure that the pandas get enough nutrition from the fruits. </p>
<p> The food selection process goes through several rounds of examination before feeding to pandas. It is to ensure the health safety of giant pandas. </p>
<p> It is now evident that giant pandas eat fruits and other foods like steamed cornbread. </p>
<p> Giant Pandas Eat Vegetables </p>
<p> Yes, giant pandas can eat vegetables even though their digestive system is better equipped to digest meat. </p>
<p> So, why do these giant pandas survive on low nutrient foods like bamboo and vegetables? </p>
<p> According to a study, scientists found that giant pandas expend a low amount of energy daily. The reason behind this is the low levels of physical activity and lower levels of thyroid hormones. </p>
<p> So, it won’t be wrong to say that 99% of giant pandas’ diet depends on bamboo and the remaining 1% depend on other foods like vegetables, fruits, and sometimes rodents. </p>
<p> Giant Pandas Eat Meat </p>
<p> 99% of the giant pandas’ diet depends on bamboo. However, according to the anatomy of their digestive tract, it is evident that giant pandas are able to digest meat. </p>
<p> We all know that Tigers can eat meat and Cows cannot; it is because of their different body and digestive structures. However, the anatomy of the giant pandas’ digestive system is unique subject to their diet or food they eat. </p>
<p> Ailuropoda melanoleuca or giant pandas belong to the bear family, which means they are able to digest meat like the other species of the same bear family. </p>
<p> Now, you might be thinking of why giant pandas only eat bamboo instead of meat. Well, a recent study explains that giant pandas became herbivores about 2.4 million years ago and completely switched their diet to bamboo. </p>
<p> However, with evolution, the anatomy of their digestive tract is still the same – which means that they are still able to digest meat. Theoretically, giant pandas can eat meat but not grass. </p>
<p> What Do Pandas Drink? </p>
<p> Another important fact about the giant pandas is that they get most of the water from bamboo and grasses. Giant pandas feed on the shoots of bamboo, which are 90% water. </p>
<p> However, giant pandas need more water than they get from bamboo, so they meet their water needs by drinking fresh water from rivers and streams that fill up by the melting of snow on the top of mountains. </p>
<p> What Do Baby Pandas Eat? </p>
<p> The newly born baby pandas rely on their mother’s milk for almost 6 months. After that period, these cute cubs of pandas start eating bamboo and other foods. </p>
<p> After the first birthday, baby pandas weigh more than 75 pounds. Although, the mother still nurses the baby pandas for another 6 months for comfort. </p>
<p> After one-and-a-half or two years, the baby panda is ready to get separated from its mother. However, the baby panda still grows and gains weight. The maximum weight it gains is up to 300 pounds. </p>
<p> So, after the initial five to six months of baby panda’s birth, the baby panda is able to walk, climb, and eat solid food like bamboo and some fruits. </p>
<p> Panda-Bear Diets </p>
<p> Although giant pandas and bears relate to the same family, giant pandas are herbivores, and bears are omnivores. Due to the same family of these two animals, there is also a similarity in their digestive system. </p>
<p> Giant pandas totally rely on bamboo, and sometimes they eat fruits and vegetables as a secondary source of food. On the other hand, bears are omnivores, and they eat meat, unlike giant pandas. </p>
<p> Moreover, giant pandas also eat according to each season. During the summer season, they feed on the shoots of bamboo, while in the autumn season, they feed on leaves, and in winter, they feed entirely on roots. </p>
<p> The pandas living in zoos also like to eat some vegetables and fruits as a snack. Moreover, some wild giant pandas also eat small rodents and pikas as a source of meat. </p>
<p> Related Questions About Panda Diet </p>
<p> Are Giant Pandas Vegetarian? </p>
<p> Yes, you can say that giant panda are vegetarian because they are herbivores and get 99% of their food from bamboo. </p>
<p> However, it is really interesting to know how pandas changed from eating meat to vegetables and then to only bamboo. </p>
<p> Giant pandas are highly mysterious animals on the earth because of their dual traits – both herbivorous and carnivorous. Giant pandas are considered as specialized herbivores that exclusively feed on high fibrous bamboo, despite the fact that they are the descendants of flesh-eating carnivores. </p>
<p> Among those herbivorous traits, some include teeth, jaw musculature, and a skull that are adapted for fibrous diets. Moreover, a pseud-thumb is another evolution in giant pandas for handling bamboo. </p>
<p> Additionally, this research reveals the fact that giant pandas have lost the ability to taste umami, which is usually connected with flesh-eating. </p>
<p> Do Giant Pandas Eat Apple? </p>
<p> Yes, giant pandas can eat apples, but apples are like a secondary source of food or as a snack for them. </p>
<p> Usually, when someone mentions giant panda, we come across a cute black and white animal holding a stalk of bamboo in its paws and eating it. No doubt, bamboo is the principal source of food for giant pandas. </p>
<p> But when we talk about the captive giant pandas, they also like apples as a snack. It won’t be wrong to say that a sweet red apple is one of the favorite snacks of giant pandas. </p>
<p> Although apples are rich in vitamins and microelements, it is important to undergo a food selection process before feeding apples to giant pandas. Since the giant pandas only rely on bamboo, so great care or precaution is required while changing their diet. </p>
<p> Animals experts also suggest that you should feed captive pandas in the morning and afternoon because they have less physical activity and spend most of their time sleeping. </p>
<p> Do Giant Pandas Eat Carrot? </p>
<p> Yes, giant pandas can eat carrots. The giant pandas living at the zoo eat carrots and other vegetables and fruits like apples, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, a special high-fiber biscuit, rice gruel, and of course, their favorite bamboo. </p>
<p> Not only this, but there are a lot of videos of giant pandas eating carrots as a piece of evidence. As I mentioned earlier, 99% of the giant pandas’ diet depends on bamboo, and the remaining 1 % depends on other foods like fruits, vegetables, small rodents, and pikas. </p>
<p> What Type of Meat Do Giant Pandas Eat? </p>
<p> The giant pandas are usually vegetarian and completely feed on bamboo. But it is also true that giant pandas sometimes hunt for pikas and small rodents as a source of food. </p>
<p> So, you can say that giant pandas sometimes eat meat, but that is rare. This trait of the eating meet has been evolved from the ancestral pandas like 2.4 million years ago. Giant pandas relate to the same family as the bear. </p>
<p> Scientists believe that giant pandas have dual-digestive traits, one is herbivorous, and the other is carnivorous. It is because of the anatomy of their digestive system. Although the giant pandas are herbivores, their digestive system is still capable of digesting meat. </p>
<p> Due to this reason, sometimes giant pandas hunt for small rodents and pikas to feed on them. Moreover, some wild giant pandas are also reported to be seen while eating meat in the northwest region of China. </p>
<p> The hidden cameras also captured the images of wild giant pandas eating meat in China. So, it is clear that giant pandas can sometimes eat small rodents and pikas, but their major food source is still bamboo. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> To summarize, giant pandas’ diet 99% rely on bamboo, and the remaining 1% rely on other foods like fruits, vegetables, small rodents, and pikas. </p>
<p> I have explained everything relating to the diet of giant pandas in detail. Moreover, you might have understood the evolution of giant pandas and their digestive system in this article. </p>
<p> Similarly, this article also includes the diet of small baby pandas and how much time they spend with their mothers. </p>
<p> The important and interesting fact about the diet of giant pandas is that the wild pandas usually feed only on bamboo, but on the other hand, captive pandas or pandas living in zoos also eat some other foods like fruits and vegetables as a source of food. </p>
<p> However, proper precaution is required to feed other foods to giant pandas. </p>

<p> What Do Raccoons Eat? </p>
<p> Raccoons can live on almost any food and are not picky about their diet. If you have raccoons in your yard, then you may be wondering what foods keep bringing them back, or you may just be wondering what they eat. In this article, I look at what they eat and how to keep them away from your property. </p>
<p> Raccoons are omnivores and eat vegetables, fruit, and nuts, along with small birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and fish. Raccoons in urban areas will supplement their diet with food from trashcans, along with cat and dog food. </p>
<p> These lovable, but pesky critters can cause a lot of damage to a property, so please read on to find out more about what they eat. </p>
<p> Raccoons Are Omnivores </p>
<p> Classed as omnivores, raccoons have a varied diet that includes almost anything. They have adapted well to living in many different habitats. Wild raccoons have the advantage of eating many types of food in their natural environment. </p>
<p> Being omnivores, a raccoon’s diet consists of both plants and animals. When in the wild, raccoons eat various fruits, grains, nuts, and vegetables, along with small mammals, amphibians, insects, and reptiles. </p>
<p> Being omnivores, a raccoon’s diet consists of both plants and animals. When in the wild, raccoons eat various fruits, grains, nuts, and vegetables, along with small mammals, amphibians, insects, and reptiles. </p>
<p> Vegetables, Fruit, And Nuts </p>
<p> Raccoons consume plenty of apples, blackberries, and cherries, which they find available in a mixed or deciduous forest. A large part of their diet, especially in the colder months, consists of nuts such as acorns. </p>
<p> Raccoons have adapted to life in forests easily due to their bodies. They have long tails to help them balance and large hands for climbing. This allows them to jump from tree to tree in search of fruit. </p>
<p> Raccoons will travel at night and during the day to find a food supply. They do this to find new stores of raw vegetables and various types of fruit and nuts. Raccoons eat more vegetables when they are readily available to survive during periods when there is less food. They can also eat fresh leaves. </p>
<p> Due to the almost unlimited supply of fresh vegetables, fruits, and nuts in the wild, these make up a large part of their diet In the winter seasons, nuts, fruits, and vegetables are considered their favorite foods. As different vegetables and fruits grow throughout the year, raccoons have a varied diet. </p>
<p> Animals </p>
<p> Raccoons are also predators. Raccoons are skilled at using their paws and sharp claws to catch and kill small rodents and even wound larger animals. </p>
<p> Raccoons are suited for survival in the wild as they have modified teeth to tear meat. This allows them to tear into a small animal’s flesh. Once they manage to catch their prey, raccoons make short work of most small animals. </p>
<p> Raccoons catch small animals such as rats, squirrels, and snakes by using their large hands. They mostly hunt small, slow moving animals as they are not quick enough to escape. </p>
<p> Raccoons also feed on aquatic animals. Raccoons are adapted to survive in marine environments by hunting small fish. Fish, along with small reptiles such as snakes, amphibians such as frogs and toads, and birds like filter feeders and ducks, all help feed a raccoon. </p>
<p> The raccoon is designed to be perfectly omnivorous. They are extremely intelligent and they can adapt and survive in different habitats. </p>
<p> Worms And Insects </p>
<p> A majority of the raccoon’s diet consists of worms and insects. They will eat what is available, and worms and insects make up a large part of their diet in the winter seasons. In the wetter months, insects and worms become an essential part of their diet. </p>
<p> Insects and worms represent easy meals for raccoons as they can get a grasp of them quickly using their large paws. Raccoons like to eat many different kinds of food, but their diet depends on what is readily available for them. </p>
<p> What Do Raccoons Eat In Urban Areas? </p>
<p> In urban areas, raccoons are restricted to living around humans. In densely populated areas, they are disadvantaged as it is more difficult for them to find their regular food. Raccoons will move around the city in search of food, just as they would in forests. Raccoons prefer the food in less urban areas as it is more plentiful. </p>
<p> Human Food </p>
<p> Raccoons can be found around dumpsters as it is an easy source of food. The leftovers they find here becomes their diet in the city. With all kinds of rotten vegetables, fruits, and insects readily available in these sites, raccoons are drawn to them. </p>
<p> Raccoons adapt quickly to these environments as they are adept at manipulating trashcans with their paws and fingers. They can get all kinds of rotten pieces of food with their sharp claws. </p>
<p> Vegetable Patch </p>
<p> Grains, corn, and vegetables form an essential part of their menu here in the city, as it is an additional source of nutrition for raccoons. Grains and corn are much easier to get outside of the city on farmlands, but the raccoon will find it if he can. Many homeowners often find their vegetable patches decimated by raccoons. </p>
<p> Why Do Raccoons Invade Homes For Food? </p>
<p> Raccoons are notorious for picking through garbage bins, but this is how they survive in the city. They usually know where homeowners keep trashcans by smelling the odor of rotten foods. Our trash is a raccoons banquet. </p>
<p> Raccoons will even go to the extent of exploring the home to eat their regular food. A raccoon will typically target trash cans and search for food, but if they can get into a home for an easy meal, they will. </p>
<p> Raccoons can enter homes searching for pet food, something you need to think about when deciding where to keep their pet food. Pet food left outside at night will not only attract raccoons but also other unwanted animals such as rats and mice. </p>
<p> Raccoons can be an absolute disaster to people who have chickens as they can eat both the eggs and the chickens. </p>
<p> Raccoons will go to the extent of hunting residential birds and other small animals to eat. They are skilled at using their paws and sharp claws to catch and kill any small prey. </p>
<p> Since Raccoons will quickly adapt their diet to whatever environment they find themselves in, finding suitable food for them in the city is not a problem. </p>

<p> What Do Skunks Eat? The Complete List of What a Skunk Eats! </p>
<p> Skunks are animals well-known for their intolerable skunk spray, which they use as self-defense. This article will give a detailed understanding of what skunks eat and why. The complete Skunk diet – including seasonal specific foods. </p>
<p> But first, here’s a quick snapshot to takeaway, then we’ll dive into more details… </p>
<p> What Do Skunks Eat? Skunks are omnivores and are very adaptable in their diet. However, their favorite food consists of small prey and insects, especially in summer and spring. Plants are usually eaten when food is scarce. In Winter, when food is extremely sparse skunks may invade garbage and trash for food. </p>
<p> Especially during the summer months, when food is in abundance, skunks will use this time to eat lots of food to sustain both themselves and their young better through the winter months. So now let’s take a look at what skunks eat… </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> What do skunks eat? </p>
<p> Before we get into the detail, we should mention that skunks – as omnivores are not overly picky animals. To some extent, they do have scavenger tendencies, so this means that their diet is very adaptable depending on seasons and availability – and is key to their survival. </p>
<p> And most importantly, skunks don’t have a proper mechanism to combat or attack animals and to prey on them. </p>
<p> Yes, they do have an effective spray for self-defense, but when it comes to their physical capacity or ability to kill animals, little is known about this. </p>
<p> So this diminished capacity for skunks to attack many animals makes it more obvious then that their diet needs to be relatively simple – and will never include prey that is too large for them to attack. </p>
<p> This also means that if they cannot find prey that they can kill and feed on, they will have to rely on foraging for food that they can eat to sustain themselves and their young, including plants and other edible foods. </p>
<p> Skunks eat small prey </p>
<p> Although humans consider skunks as a nuisance because of their unpleasant odor, they are beneficial in many ways. </p>
<p> This is because skunks prey on small creatures that are harmful to gardening and a healthy lifestyle as a whole. It’s estimated that on average around 70% of a skunk’s diet is made of up harmful insects. </p>
<p> As such even if skunks may seem and sound like a nuisance, they do still help in getting rid of destructive insects around the home and yard instead. </p>
<p> Many yard pests and other yard creatures and insects make up the bulk od a skunk’s diet, like:- </p>
<p> While these may sound common prey for pretty much most of the animals, what interesting about a skunk’s diet is that skunks are one of the major predators of the honeybee. </p>
<p> Of course, protecting themselves from bee stings is possible with their thick tuft of fur on their bodies. How skunks attack the beehives is also quite interesting. </p>
<p> Firstly they scratch the beehives with their forefeet and long claws. This will firstly trigger the guard bees to come out and they usually are the first set of bees that get eaten up. </p>
<p> Some of the prey that skunks choose to eat are often to teach their young ones on self-defense mechanisms. Especially when skunks targets more treacherous animals like snakes and the treacherous black widow spider. </p>
<p> Apart from being a nutritious diet, they’re animals that teach instinctive mechanisms for attacking and self-defense to their young. </p>
<p> A skunks diet in winter </p>
<p> Skunks do not fully hibernate in winter, at times during winter when a skunk wakes from its torpor – usually, when temperatures are 30° Fahrenheit or above. They may choose to leave the comfort of their den at night to forage for food. </p>
<p> Skunks eat plants </p>
<p> As we mentioned earlier, skunks are omnivores and their diet also consists of plants. But it has to be said the plant-based diet is mostly only an alternative that skunks turn to during times when food is scarce. </p>
<p> Plants are also consumed by skunks when they cannot find their favorite food easily, either by a simple shortage for that year or because colder weather is beginning to set in. </p>
<p> It has to be said, the favored food for a skunk is mainly small creatures and those listed above. But, mostly during late fall and winter, skunks often do have to eat plants as an alternative, when available, skunks will opt to eat:- </p>
<p> Corn </p>
<p> Grapes </p>
<p> Cherries </p>
<p> Other berries </p>
<p> During winter, skunks may also search for and eat:- </p>
<p> Seeds </p>
<p> Nuts </p>
<p> Plant parts on the ground </p>
<p> Plant roots </p>
<p> Roots and fruits of plants are one of the favorite parts of their plant-based diet as their available around ground level. </p>
<p> Skunks diet in urban environments </p>
<p> Most skunks, especially when food is not available, will also look to invade homes and feed on decaying plants and other food sources around properties, which is mainly when skunks become an annoyance for humans. So, similar to a fox’s diet, skunks will eat garbage! </p>
<p> Skunks eat garbage </p>
<p> Although this may sound unpleasant to us, skunks are omnivores and so they are very versatile and adaptable when it comes to food. </p>
<p> So they do feed on human garbage and trash. Especially as unattended garbage is also very welcoming to insects, rodents that skunks can also eat. </p>
<p> Plus leftovers and even rotting food from the garbage can could potentially make up a huge meal for skunks that are foraging for food. </p>
<p> Skunks deviously raid garbage and trash looking for their favorite food, which can quickly create a complete mess in backyards and entrances. </p>
<p> When food isn’t available in trash or garbage, this can bring more problems. This is because when skunks don’t find what they want in the garbage they can often target other food courses, such as:- </p>
<p> Bird feeders </p>
<p> Compost piles </p>
<p> BBQ grills </p>
<p> This often further aggravates the problems that skunks can pose to humans. </p>
<p> But it’s important to remember that skunks, like rats, are animals of routine. This means that when skunks locate a steady source of food from garbage and trash cans, they may forge a habit of visiting your home more often in search of the same food source, especially during winter, when food is scarce. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, aside from the spray, this is largely why humans do not like skunks. </p>
<p> How and Why Skunks Change Their Diet </p>
<p> Skunks as omnivores generally prefer animals over plants. But depending on the seasons and availability of food, these can differ. </p>
<p> Starting with summer and spring, these are the times that skunks feed on fresh food sources as they’re available in plentiful supply. </p>
<p> During spring and summertime, skunks will feed on grasshoppers, bees, beetles, beetle larvae, and crickets as well as others from our first list above. </p>
<p> During this time, skunks naturally eat fewer plants and more prey. As winter approaches, when the availability of food reduces, skunks will eat food that is not as fresh and those that even fall to the ground and are easily accessible. </p>
<p> This includes fruits and crops that are left rotten or not harvested. It’s also during winter that skunks will dig in through garbage and trash more often. </p>
<p> Over this cold season and as a last resort, skunks may occasionally kill poultry to eat their eggs. In fact, during this season skunks will usually eat anything edible they come across if it provides sufficient nourishment. </p>
<p> Skunks adopt this eating pattern in winter because since they don’t fully hibernate they need to find food to help keep them active and warm and provide enough layers of fat. </p>

<p> What Do Squirrels Eat? the Complete List of Squirrel Foods </p>
<p> Many of us happen across squirrels eating something all the time, that’s because they’re real foodies, and like to eat a lot. They also eat a lot of things – but not all things are good for them. </p>
<p> Here we’re going to list all the foodstuffs that squirrels include in their diet and the things people feed them that they probably shouldn’t. </p>
<p> What Do Squirrels Eat? Squirrels are omnivores and so eat plants and animals. Other than the food they find in their habitats like vegetables, fruits, nuts, plant materials, bird’s eggs, insects and fungi, squirrels have also adapted to eat food they find in human habitats like birdseed, cereals, pet food, cheese, and trash. </p>
<p> Squirrels are not necessarily choosy eaters though. If you’ve ever spent time observing the eating patterns of squirrels, you might find quite a variety of food in their diet. </p>
<p> Squirrels are part of the Sciuridae family of mammals, closely related to chipmunks, prairie dogs, and woodchucks. </p>
<p> Squirrels are found in plentiful supply in North America, but also throughout the world, and there are a number of species, here are the seven main species whose foods we’ll be focussing on… </p>
<p> Ground squirrels </p>
<p> These tiny creatures are familiar throughout much of North America and the world. </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> Squirrels are omnivores </p>
<p> Squirrels are predominantly herbivores. But you can class them as omnivores because of the wide variety of food types they’re known to feast on. </p>
<p> Much like foxes, squirrels tend to forage and scratch around for anything they feel is edible. </p>
<p> From the time they become young adults, they embark on a journey of learning what to eat – guided largely by their parents and by exploring different food groups themselves. </p>
<p> If you’re looking for the ideal food that will nourish your local squirrels and cover all the food nutrition they need – and have them coming back for more, then this squirrel food we used from amazon is perfect! </p>
<p> Squirrel’s main food groups </p>
<p> Squirrels have a natural appetite for the following food groups, not all of them are their favorites, and not all of them are necessarily good for them – which we’ll explore later… </p>
<p> Being omnivores makes it easier for them, as they have no clear boundaries on their dining habits. </p>
<p> Squirrel food as a baby Squirrel </p>
<p> As infants, squirrels rely only on their mother’s milk. They continue to feed on their mother’s milk for about 40 days – since they do not leave the nest during that period. </p>
<p> But once they reach maturity and are able to eat solid foods. Then their curiosity will have them exploring all kinds of foods and food groups </p>
<p> Squirrels are pretty open-minded when it comes to food. This may, unfortunately, make them fond of food that they should not be eating, like your favorite candy bars! </p>
<p> So now, we’ve touched on the food groups, so we’re going to dive into each of these areas and give you a complete guide on what squirrels eat – within each food group. </p>
<p> Thankfully, most squirrels seek to maintain a balanced diet naturally. Even though they can fall foul of too much of the wrong foods on occasion – as we’ll explore later. </p>
<p> Squirrels eat fruit and berries </p>
<p> Fruits are one of the squirrel’s favorite food, but like most food groups, it’s better for them to maintain a balanced diet, too much fruit can prevent them from absorbing calcium – so keep fruit-based treats to a minimum. </p>
<p> There are lots of different types of fruit that are readily available in abundance during summer and fall so they will consume more of it during this time. </p>
<p> The high levels of natural sugar in fruits help them to increase their weight ready for the winter, as well as an added energy boost for foraging. </p>
<p> Squirrels have well-adapted claws that make it easy for them to climb trees, their perfect balance helps them to climb along long thin fruit branches to get nuts and berries. </p>
<p> Fruiting trees </p>
<p> They eat from a variety of fruiting trees that includes (but are not limited to)… </p>
<p> Other fruits and berries </p>
<p> When it comes to their range of berries, they’re much like us. Because of thorny branches and thin vines, these can sometimes be harder to get to, but they’ll always figure ways of getting to them. </p>
<p> Squirrels will happily eat just about any edible grape and berry available, here’s the main selection… </p>
<p> Of course, there is some ambiguity as to what is classed as a berry or a fruit, but we’ve added these together for convenience – to keep the list fairly simple. </p>
<p> Squirrels eat salad and vegetables </p>
<p> Squirrels also add vegetables to their diet. In fact, they eat a variety of vegetables the same as they do with fruits. </p>
<p> Farmers and gardeners are unfortunately very familiar with the vegetables that squirrels eat. But the amount of food taken by squirrels is thankfully quite minimal. </p>
<p> Here’s the main selection of vegetables that squirrels eat… </p>
<p> Pretty much any tasty vegetables they can get to and take, or dig up. As gardeners know, they’re also pretty clever at getting around many gardeners defenses to get to the good food! </p>
<p> Squirrels eat cereal and grain </p>
<p> Squirrel enthusiasts feed squirrels with cereals. Squirrels tend to love the grains and the nuts within the cereals. </p>
<p> Corn flakes, wheat-based cereal, chex, grape nuts and many more are all an acceptable part of their cereal diet – but with some caution – read on… </p>
<p> The benefit of these cereals is that they’re loaded with sugar that gives them extra energy. </p>
<p> The energy gained by sugar can then be used by these tiny furry animals to keep foraging for more food throughout the day, they’ll look to store any that they don’t consume immediately. </p>
<p> Generally speaking, they’re not the first choice for squirrels, but when offered, or when it’s the only food available at the time they’ll take it. </p>
<p> Note: It’s not a good idea to feed squirrels any field corn – corn ears. They can sometimes have to grow on them a deadly toxic mold that is near invisible to squirrels. So do not put corn out for squirrels. In fact, we’d recommend steering clear of any corn-based products. </p>
<p> In fact, also note that unfortunately, feeding squirrels too much of these sugary cereal snacks are not actually that good for them. They begin to “crave” these foods more and more, and so begin to turn their backs on the more natural foods they should be foraging for and eating and that they’d normally find in the wild. </p>
<p> So if you’re feeding squirrels these kinds of cereals, try not to, or at least minimize the amount you give them – or mix them as a small amount – like a treat, alongside other more natural foods so that they’ll more likely eat those too. </p>
<p> Squirrels eat nuts </p>
<p> Of course! When we think of squirrels, we naturally think of them foraging, eating and storing nuts for the winter – and for the most part, we’d be right. So we simply have to include nuts! </p>
<p> Nuts are indeed a favored food for squirrels. If you have any nut trees or bushes in your backyard or you live near a nut tree orchard, then there’s a good chance you’ll have squirrels living nearby, and you’ll see squirrels carrying away nuts from the trees or bushes to either eat or store. </p>
<p> When they’re not eating any nuts they find on the trees, squirrels will take a few to store in various places and as a tasty meal over the wintertime. </p>
<p> As nuts are arguable squirrels’ favorite food, they pretty much eat any nuts available, but squirrels are predominantly herbivores, and as such need to maintain a balanced diet of vitamins and minerals from vegetables and other sources. So feeding them nuts constantly is not a good practice. </p>
<p> Nuts that are in shells are a rich source of nutrition for squirrels, in both fatty acids and protein and are suitable for all types of squirrels. They also assist in keeping teeth ground down and preventing their front teeth from growing too long. </p>
<p> The fat content from nuts helps squirrels to build up fat reserves for the winter when food is more scarce. </p>
<p> It’s hard to prevent squirrels from eating the nuts on your nut trees, and especially bushes. But there are precautions you can take to make it harder for them. </p>
<p> Tree trunks can be wrapped in sheets of metal, these make it hard for squirrels to climb up the tree, but that may not prevent them from using nearby tree branches and other objects to traverse in order to reach your trees. </p>
<p> One good point to squirrels eating nuts is that they don’t always remember where they buried every nut. This means the seeds can be dispersed far and wide. This, in turn, ensures greater survival of species of trees easily – nature manages everything! </p>
<p> Always try to feed squirrels nuts that they would otherwise have found natively in their natural habitat. Where we are there’s an abundance of acorn trees and chestnut trees. So we tend to feed them those – in moderation! </p>
<p> Peanuts – caution </p>
<p> Although the occasional Peanut will not harm a squirrel, and in fact, they might live near where peanuts are grown and may dig them up from time to time. But, in fact, peanuts are not nuts, they are actually classed as legumes, so these – along with corn are not an ideal food for squirrels. </p>
<p> Peanuts are not nuts! They are legumes, and unless a squirrel lives next to a field of peanuts where they might dig some up and eat them, then it’s best not to feed them. In fact, peanuts can harbor a near-invisible mold that is toxic and can potentially harm or kill them. </p>
<p> Squirrels eat seeds and grains </p>
<p> Squirrels will eat bird seeds. Any birdwatcher who has a bird feeder in their back yard will have likely seen squirrels attempting to get into the bird feeder containers. </p>
<p> Bird feeders are made available in abundance for squirrels by humans. An easy and continuous supply of food will encourage squirrels to nest nearby. </p>
<p> There are humane measures you can take to prevent squirrels from eating – and sometimes destroying your bird feeders. We found that this squirrel guard on Amazon is perfect! </p>
<p> Squirrels eat insects </p>
<p> When fruits, nuts – and birdseed is in short supply, such as late fall and early winter, squirrels will still look to maintain their quota of protein. </p>
<p> They may turn to eat insects to satisfy their protein needs. Although it’s not clear if they are specific about their choice of insect species, it’s likely they could feed on the following… </p>
<p> Caterpillars </p>
<p> Grasshoppers </p>
<p> Crickets </p>
<p> These are just a selection of the types of insects a squirrel is likely to catch and feed upon. </p>
<p> Squirrels eat fungi and mushrooms </p>
<p> It might sound surprising, but squirrels do forage for mushrooms and fungi too. Depending on the climate in many natural environment fungi is a food option for many squirrels. </p>
<p> Truffles </p>
<p> Acron truffles </p>
<p> Plant seeds, e.g. sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, poppy seeds, and others </p>
<p> As long as the food can give them enough value in nutrient then they will consider eating it. </p>
<p> Squirrels tend to aim for the more tender parts of young plants. Those being young stalks, the more tender branches, soft barks, and soft twigs make ideal plant parts for squirrels to eat. </p>
<p> Squirrels have been known to eat eggs </p>
<p> Again, when food sources become scarce or when it gets harder to find food, squirrels have been known to eat whatever it can get – this may include stealing too. Squirrels will steal eggs from birds nests and even some eggs from your chicken coop if given the chance. </p>
<p> Squirrels prey on blackbird eggs and robin eggs. And they don’t stop there, squirrels have also been known to eat hatchlings, baby birds and young chicks. Including those unfortunate enough to have fallen from their nests and died – but this is rare. </p>
<p> Squirrels eat pet food </p>
<p> Squirrels have developed a variety of eating habits and are willing to test many things – pet food being one of them. </p>
<p> So they may also attempt to eat dog food and cat food that has been left out. They will also return to the same spot if it’s left there regularly. So it’s probably best to clear out any dog food or cat food after it’s been eaten by your pet. </p>
<p> Squirrels eat scraps and waste </p>
<p> Each time you take the garbage out, or the trashcan, don’t be surprised to find that squirrels may rummage around it if given the chance. Like foxes, they will feed on scraps of waste if it seems edible and may have nutritional value. </p>
<p> Best to try to make sure your trash is secure from squirrels and other scavengers. </p>
<p> Did You Know? Red and grey squirrels are both known to bury their food to dig up and eat later. The main difference between these two squirrel species is their memory. The grey squirrels are better at remembering where they buried their supplies. Red squirrels, however, are a little more forgetful. </p>
<p> Squirrels eat cheese! </p>
<p> Cheese, of course, is not a food that’s readily available for squirrels in their natural habitat or the environment where they would normally source food. Their cheese habit is most likely developed by outdoor dining restaurants and kitchen scraps. </p>
<p> Humans leaving cheese, or any similar savory leftovers around outdoor dining spots have left a cheese treat for squirrels. Even where any kitchen scraps that have bits of cheese have been thrown out a squirrel will forage for and find. </p>
<p> As the availability to eat cheese comes as mere luck, squirrels aren’t choosy about their cheese type! Most cheeses are a great source of fat content. </p>
<p> They’ll happily feast on almost any cheese – from chunks and scraps of cheddar, swiss, provolone, mozzarella – and just about any other cheesy food like Pizza scraps, cheese savories and crackers, and your discarded cheese sandwich. </p>
<p> What not to feed a squirrel </p>
<p> We’ve mentioned not to feed squirrels corn-based products, or corn ears, and not to feed them peanuts. We’ve also discussed not to feed them sugary treats, or to leave pet food available for them. </p>
<p> We recommend not feeding squirrels popcorn. It’s corn-based and has no nutritional value for squirrels. It’s too sugary and or too salty. </p>
<p> Probably very important on the list is bread. We do not recommend feeding bread to squirrels. Any cellulose-based products are not good for them. Brown bread is debatable but it’s perhaps better to stay clear altogether. </p>
<p> Here’s the most comprehensive list you’ll find about what NOT to feed squirrels. </p>
<p> Squirrels will not eat </p>
<p> Jalapeños </p>

<p> To finish </p>
<p> Squirrels generally aren’t that fussy. They’ll enjoy most foods, and can act like they’re at a child’s birthday party if they can get their paws on the wrong kind of treats! </p>
<p> Generally, it’s best for them to enjoy foods from within their normal habitat, a healthy dose of nuts, vegetables, seeds and grains when they’re available and perhaps a bit of fruit for afters! </p>
<p> When times are hard, squirrels will turn to most foods. It’s tough in the wild and survival is key. </p>

<p> The life-cycle of frogs is definitely very interesting to read, and seeing this life-cycle in the aquarium is now a passion among many fish keepers. A Tadpole takes almost 12 weeks to become a frog, and they need intense care and proper diet during these 12 weeks. </p>
<p> Fish keepers often find difficulties at the time of feeding the Tadpoles because, unlike the newly hatched fries, the food of a Tadpole keeps changing in their growth weeks. </p>
<p> You need compact knowledge about the diet of Tadpoles. Being extra careful and selective while feeding your Tadpoles will help them grow into a healthy frog. Read the article till the end to know what do Tadpoles eat. </p>
<p> What Do Tadpoles Eat? </p>
<p> Tadpoles generally live on a diverse diet, and you will get several food options available for them. But, indeed, all the foods are not equally nutritious for the Tadpoles. So, the fish keepers search for the healthiest for their aquarium Tadpoles. Here we are suggesting the top 8 healthiest food options for the Tadpoles. Have a look at these Tadpole foods: </p>
<p> 01 </p>
<p> Aquatic Plants and Algae </p>
<p> Aquatic plants are considered as the primary meal of the Tadpoles, but you need to be selective at the time of choosing the aquatic plants. Hornwort and Cryptocoryne can help them to grow healthy. Also, try to keep Java Moss and Java Fern in your tank, which will give a place to hide to these Tadpoles. </p>
<p> Fast-growing plants like Duckweed and Sagittaria Subulata will be good for the Tadpoles as they eat more often. They will consume aquatic plants very fast, and you need to make sure that there will be no lack of plants. They will have an appetite for floating weeds and grasses too. </p>
<p> Tadpoles prefer to scrape and eat the algae from the bottom of the aquarium. Make sure that there are not excessive algae as the Tadpoles will keep eating and be obese. More than one layer of algae in the aquarium base is not at all acceptable. </p>
<p> Nutrients </p>
<p> These green leaves will supply vitamin A, C and K, and minerals. These leaves contain fibers, which are also good for the growth of the Tadpoles. </p>
<p> 02 </p>
<p> Leafy Vegetables </p>
<p> They gradually intake the leaves on which they live, and these leaves supply essential nutrients to their body. Along with that, kale, lettuce leaves, and spinach leaves will also be healthy food options for Tadpoles. These leaves can be supplied as fresh and also as boiled. You can boil the leaves for 5 minutes or until they become soft. They are also seen to consume the falling leaves of the aquatic plants too. </p>
<p> Nutrients </p>
<p> The essential minerals like iron and calcium are supplied through these leaves. Lettuce leaves also help in the digestion process of these Tadpoles to keep them active. </p>
<p> 03 </p>
<p> Fruits and Vegetables </p>
<p> Broccoli, pea, green beans, zucchini, spinach, broccoli, green pepper, and lettuce will serve the Tadpole well. These vegetables can be fed both as fresh and as boiled. Chop these veggies in small pieces and feed them twice a day. Small pieces of fruits can also be served to the Tadpoles. Among the fruits, you can try green grapes. </p>
<p> Any homegrown green vegetables and fruits which are free from pesticides can be fed to the Tadpoles. You can use frozen vegetables too for the Tadpoles. You can fry the small slices of the vegetables as well as the boiled vegetables for them. For boiled peas, you can crush it or remove its skin. </p>
<p> Pro-Tip </p>
<p> Try to avoid celery from the diet of the Tadpoles as the chance of spraying pesticides in it, is very high. </p>
<p> Nutrients </p>
<p> The Tadpoles will get the essential vitamins (A, B, C, and K) from the boiled foods. Vitamins of green veggies keep them active. Fresh Fruits will make them energetic and give them a stronger digestion power. Fruits also contain multivitamins, which will later break in carbohydrates and keep the Tadpoles healthy. </p>
<p> 04 </p>
<p> Various Herbivorous Meals </p>
<p> For the better health of Tadpoles, you can feed Spirulina Meals to them. Outside flakes and meals are much needed for Tadpoles because the aquatic plants and algae sometimes cannot provide everything they need. </p>
<p> You can try Flakes or AlgaeWafers, Algae Discs, and Seaweed Meal to see the visible growth of the Tadpoles. Along with this, you can rely on instant foods like Tropical Algae Wafers for Bottom Feeding Herbivorous Fish, Tropical Flakes, and Ecopond (Veggie) Tadpole Food for the Tadpoles. Lucky Reptile Quappo Food is also a popular instant food among the store-bought foods for the Tadpoles. </p>
<p> Nutrients </p>
<p> These meals supply the energy to the Tadpoles so that they can continue their playful activities throughout the day. They will get Thiamine and Biotin from the packaged foods. Algae wafers and discs will supply protein to the Tadpoles. </p>
<p> 05 </p>
<p> Calcium Elements </p>
<p> These are much-required food items for the Tadpoles in their growth period. You can add a few drops (2 drops per liter) of liquid calcium in the aquarium. Also, you can place a cuttlebone in the aquarium so that the level of calcium remains steady. </p>
<p> Nutrients </p>
<p> The need for calcium in every living being is undeniable, and the Tadpoles are not an exception. Calcium will help in the overall development of the Tadpoles. </p>
<p> 06 </p>
<p> Fish Flakes </p>
<p> Fish food flakes are the high protein meals for the Tadpoles, and these contain high protein. It helps them in fast and healthy growth. Cobalt Aquatics 34291 Frog & Tadpole Minis will be an ideal flake for them. AQUARIAN Complete Nutrition, Frog & Tadpole sinking pellets are some of the instant flakes for the Tadpoles. You can get all these flakes easily in any store. </p>
<p> Nutrients </p>
<p> All these food items contain Vitamin, Thiamine, and Lecithin, which promote a healthy life to the Tadpole. Along with that, these food items supply energy due to the presence of carb in them. Minerals and fibers will be supplied from flakes and meals. </p>
<p> 07 </p>
<p> Omnivorous Meals </p>
<p> Zoo Med Aquatic Frog & Tadpole Food is the most popular instant foods among the store-bought foods for the Tadpoles. Most of these instant flakes contain brown rice, dried yeast, white gluten, and various protein and calcium elements. It will allow the Tadpoles to be healthier. </p>
<p> Some other store-bought foods like Cobalt Aquatics 34291 Frog & Tadpole Minis will be ideal for them. AQUARIAN Complete Nutrition, Frog & Tadpole sinking pellets are some among the instant flakes for these Tadpoles. These store-bought foods contain the goodness of algae and vegetables as well as the protein of fish flakes. </p>
<p> Pro-Tip </p>
<p> At the time of selecting the meals, check whether it is for the early stage of Tadpoles, or it is for the late stages of Tadpoles. Also, check the elements included in the meals. </p>
<p> Nutrients </p>
<p> They will get Thiamine from the omnivorous fish meals. These meals make the internal buildup of the Tadpoles stronger as the gills of the Tadpoles are not fully built at the early stage. The omnivorous meals are generally supplied to the Tadpoles on the 2nd or 3rd week of hatching. These omnivorous meals will help the Tadpoles to have an appetite for the animal proteins, which will be supplied to them after the 3rd week. </p>
<p> 08 </p>
<p> High Protein Foods </p>
<p> These foods help a lot in the metamorphosis of the tiny Tadpoles to mini frogs. Live and dead insect and fish protein and egg protein are the mandatory requirements of the adult Tadpoles. Hard-boiled egg yolk and homemade fish food will also be good choices of food for them. You just need to crumble the yolk and spread evenly on the tank surface. </p>
<p> For the insect protein, you can start with dead flies, shrimps, fruit flies, dead insects, fish food flakes, and live bugs. </p>
<p> Among the live foods, Aphids, fish food pellets, Black worms, Bloodworm, frozen fish, Brine Shrimp, and insect larvae are the most popular non-veg food choices for these Tadpoles. Frozen Foods (insects) are also a much-preferred meal of them. Additionally, you need to opt for Mealworms, small fish (both dead and live), and Crickets (frozen) in their diet. </p>
<p> These foods are for the adult Tadpoles, and they will try to catch their food, especially live foods. They are always busy in some activities, and they swim in the entire aquarium. Make sure you create enough hiding places from where they can jump on the live foods and catch. These hidden places will reduce the stress of the Tadpoles, and they will not tend to reject foods. </p>
<p> Pro-Tip </p>
<p> Try to avoid any meat for the Tadpoles as their intestines are not properly buildup to digest meat. </p>
<p> Nutrients </p>
<p> These live foods supply protein and vegetables will supply the calcium, iodine, and iron to the Tadpoles. As a result, the bones of the Tadpoles become stronger. Egg-yolk and all the dead flies and insects contain high protein. These foods appear to be delicious as well as very nutritious to the Tadpoles. Egg yolk also helps in their digestion process. </p>
<p> These are the foods the frogs generally intake, so by feeding these live foods to the Tadpoles, you are actually helping them to have an appetite for these foods. If you are planning to skip the live foods from the diet of your Tadpoles, they will be weak. Most importantly, these live foods are used to feed on the adult Tadpoles, and their physical build-up is more and more complicated. Live foods will give strength to the Tadpoles to cope up with their physical changes. </p>
<p> Now, let’s focus on 3 very obvious questions… </p>
<p> What do Tadpoles Eat in Aquarium? </p>
<p> So, these are the food options for the Tadpoles when you are keeping them in an aquarium. If you bring a hatched Tadpole for your aquarium and plan to release it to its natural habitat before becoming an adult frog, you need to be extremely careful about their diet. In an aquarium, the Tadpoles generally start with a herbivorous diet and become omnivorous for a certain time and live on a carnivorous diet for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p> How Much and How Often to Feed the Tadpoles in Aquarium? </p>
<p> You have to feed the Tadpoles every single day; otherwise, they will starve. Also, feed every day at the same time. The quantity for all the instant food has to be one pinch only. For vegetables and fruits, do not give more than two small cubes in a day. If you find that the food is uneaten, it is a sign that the quantity was excessive. Small chunks of boiled food will also be alright for the Tadpoles. Generally, one or two meals a day will be alright for the Tadpoles as they will keep eating algae. </p>
<p> What Do Tadpoles Eat In The Wild? </p>
<p> Tadpoles in their natural habitat eat whatever they come across, and they are omnivorous from the second week of their birth. Adult frogs lay eggs on the leaves; so, Tadpoles stick on to the leaves and eat those leaves. They are capable of finding foods, and gradually, they learn to catch the small insects and fly, which supply protein and calcium to them help in their growth. They live on algae only if they cannot find the small animals or insects (dead and live) and water striders to eat. </p>
<p> Well, these are the foods, but there is a little twist! Unlike the small fries, you cannot feed the same food to the Tadpoles throughout their growth. Know this in detail… </p>
<p> Change of Food in Different Stages of Growth </p>
<p> A close look at the growth process of the Tadpoles will reveal seven stages between hatching and becoming a short-tailed mini frog. A Tadpole cannot live on the same food in these seven stages. A diverse diet is mandatory for their healthy growth. </p>
<p> Stage 1: Tadpoles Clinging To Water Plants </p>
<p> At the initial stage, the Tadpoles cling in the aquatic plants and eat the plants. As they mainly prefer the no-current areas, they get excessive algae to eat as well. You need to clean up the algae at least once a week. </p>
<p> Stage 2: Tadpoles with External Gills </p>
<p> After 4 to 5 days, their external gills are formed, and they become the look-alikes of the small fries! They start swimming, and adequate energy is required from the foods. During this stage of growth, along with plants and algae, vegetables can be fed. Along with that, you can try the herbivorous meals on the alternative days. </p>
<p> Stage 3: Tadpoles with Internal Gills </p>
<p> From the 10th day, you will be able to see the internal gills. At this stage, herbivorous meals, along with leafy veggies like spinach, kale, and lettuce, will be required. Tadpoles are seemed to be very selective at this time, and they leave the foods uneaten more often. You have to be a good observer at this stage to see whether the Tadpoles have consumed the food (partly or full) or not. The Tadpoles must not starve. You have to try different food items almost every day for the Tadpoles. Also, they are stressed due to the change in their body. Make sure the level of calcium in the water is alright at this stage. </p>
<p> Stage 4: Tadpoles with Operculum </p>
<p> After 2-3 days, you will see that the internal gills got a covering called Operculum, and it protects the gills from outside attacks. In simpler words, the buildup of Tadpoles becomes more and more complex at this stage. Boiled vegetables are mandatory at this time. Along with this, you can start the omnivorous meals too. You need to get high quality instant omnivorous flakes for the growth of your Tadpoles. Continue this for seven weeks until you see the back legs. </p>
<p> Stage 5: Tadpoles with Two Legs </p>
<p> Back legs make the Tadpoles twice sporty, and they need a high protein diet. Include the egg yolk, dead insects, and omnivorous meals. At least once a week fed them with fruit and fresh or boiled veggies. You will be able to see them climbing and staying out of water for a few seconds. </p>
<p> Stage 6: Tadpoles with Four Legs </p>
<p> Forelegs appear on the 12th week, and at this time, their tails start to shorten by this time. They will try to come out of water and prey. The Tadpoles are adults now, and you must include live foods at this stage as they are now carnivorous. Also, the Tadpoles will feel stressed very often due to excessive activities, and live foods will reduce that stress. </p>
<p> Stage 7: Tadpoles with Shorter Tails </p>
<p> After a few days of appearing the forelegs, the formation of lungs will be completed, and their tails become smaller. Also, their legs will be stronger, and they are capable of breathing out of water. In short, and they are ready to be amphibians. At this point, outside foods are not required as they live on the foods stored in their tails. </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> So, if you want to see the transition of the Tadpoles in your freshwater aquarium, it is not going to be that difficult. But, yes, you need to make some adjustments in your aquarium by placing some healthy aquatic plants, and of course, you have to arrange a proper diet for the Tadpoles. They are known to hop a lot, which might affect the décor of your aquarium. For a change, you can definitely keep the Tadpoles and witness their metamorphosis. </p>

<p> What do toads eat? The complete guide to toad food </p>
<p> If you ask most people the question ‘what do toads eat?’, the most common answer would probably be crickets. And it’s true – toads do eat crickets – but they eat lots of other things too. </p>
<p> So, what do toads eat? </p>
<p> What a toad eats depends on the species. Generally speaking, toads eat crickets, mealworms, wax worms, and super worms. This is a basic diet that will do for most toads, regardless of their species. </p>
<p> However, that’s not to say that toads only eat these things. Or that they shouldn’t eat a variety of foods. Like humans, toads need a balanced diet. </p>
<p> What do toads eat? 12 foods that toads love… </p>
<p> Toads are very closely related to frogs and this is not only shown in how they look, but also in their dietary needs. </p>
<p> Toads are carnivores, so they enjoy eating live prey. But what kind of prey? Here are 12 creatures that toads love to eat… </p>
<p> The last one may be a bit shocking… but it’s true. Toads do sometimes eat other toads! </p>
<p> What do wild toads eat? </p>
<p> Wild toads live all over the world and there are lots of different species. </p>
<p> Since they have such different habitats, the diets of different toads differ from one another. </p>
<p> Most commonly, toads will eat larger insects and larvae as an adult. When they are young they try to feed themselves on flies and ants. </p>
<p> Fun fact: When a toad is really large, it can even eat small mice and lizards. All of the things he eats are swallowed whole. This is due to the fact that a toad doesn’t have any teeth in their lower jaws and cannot chew. </p>
<p> What do toads eat in captivity? </p>
<p> In captivity, toads should eat the same kind of foods as they would in the wild. </p>
<p> If you give a pet toad something from the list above, they will eat it. </p>
<p> However, when toads are kept as pets, the most common choice of food is crickets or mealworms. </p>
<p> This is not because it is best for the toad, but generally because they are the foods that are most readily available. </p>
<p> You can, however, buy some baby mice, or catch some insects yourself to feed your toad. This will give your toad some variety in their diet. </p>
<p> You should also: </p>
<p> Give your toad food that is the appropriate size. The right size is about the size of a cricket. </p>
<p> Try to give 4 to 6 items of food in your toad’s diet. </p>
<p> Your toad will start to learn when you feed it, so try to be as consistent as possible. This means that you should aim to feed your toad at the same time every day. </p>
<p> What is the best thing to give to your toad in captivity? </p>
<p> We recommend feeding crickets to your toad. Live crickets are readily available and low in cost. Besides that, they are very healthy for your toad. </p>
<p> We would, however, suggest dusting the crickets with calcium and vitamins supplements. This is due to the fact that toads do not get as much UVB from the sun as they would get in the wild. UVB plays a very important role in how they metabolize vitamins and calcium and therefore you need to help your pet frog a little. </p>
<p> Do this and your pet toad will be very happy and healthy! </p>
<p> How often should you feed a toad? </p>
<p> How often you feed your toad depends on your toad’s age. </p>
<p> When you have a juvenile toad, you should feed him every day. </p>
<p> If you have an adult toad you should try to feed him about three times a week. </p>
<p> What human food do toads eat? </p>
<p> Some people will say that toads can eat human food like vegetables and fruits, but they are wrong! </p>
<p> You should not feed your pet toad vegetables and fruits. Both frogs and toads do not eat plant matter. They don’t have the right digestive system to be able to digest these kinds of foods. </p>
<p> You should also avoid giving them processed meat for the same reason. </p>
<p> If you want to give your toad more nutrients, and you’re raising your own crickets, try to feed your crickets some fruit so they would absorb the nutrients. You can also try supplements like this. </p>
<p> How do toads eat? </p>
<p> The way that toads eat is really quite interesting! </p>
<p> When they see their prey, a toad will normally patiently wait for it to move before eating it. While they wait, they carefully examine the prey, waiting for the perfect moment to catch it. </p>
<p> When the toad sees the right moment, he flicks out his long sticky tongue and sticks it to the prey. </p>
<p> The toad’s tongue then retracts back, as quickly as it popped out, and the food goes down in one gulp. </p>
<p> The prey he just ate is still very much alive and is slowly processed by the toad’s digestive system. </p>
<p> If you want to see a great video of how a toad eat, take a look at the video below. </p>
<p> How long can toads go without eating? </p>
<p> How long a toad can go without eating depends on the weight of the toad and its age (juveniles need food available to them at all times), as well as the type of toad. </p>
<p> Personally, I have never left my toad without food for more than three days. If I’m away longer I make sure someone is going to feed it. </p>
<p> That said, toads can go up to two weeks without eating. </p>
<p> How much a toad eats will also be influenced by whether they are preparing to hibernate. </p>
<p> What do baby toads eat? </p>
<p> Toad tadpoles eat a bit differently to adults. </p>
<p> Earlier, we said that toads don’t eat vegetables and fruits. This is true for adult toads, but it isn’t true for tadpoles. Toad tadpoles eat vegetation, such as half-rotten plants that they find in their pond. </p>
<p> When toad tadpoles get a bit older they start to eat plants that were too hard to eat when they were younger. So, when you have toad tadpoles in captivity, you have to begin by feeding them lettuce leaves. But before you do, make sure that you dip the lettuce in boiling water for 2 seconds so that it is soft enough to eat. </p>
<p> The following days you can start giving it some harder vegetables like peas (although you should cut them in half and remove the shells). </p>
<p> Also consider giving your tadpoles leeks, celery, carrots. Just make sure that these foods are cooked. This way it is easy for the toad tadpoles to eat it. </p>
<p> Toads that are no longer tadpoles, but not yet fully grown, will eat pinhead crickets, meal worms, wax worms and grubs. All of these are small and easy-to-eat enough for a baby toad to swallow and digest properly. </p>
<p> Once toads become fully grown adults, they will be carnivores for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p> What do toads eat in the garden? </p>
<p> By now, you’ve probably gathered that toads aren’t very strict about what they eat. </p>
<p> They eat almost anything that will fit in their mouths! </p>
<p> On top of the list we gave earlier, they also eat flies, slugs, snails, spiders and even more! </p>
<p> It’s a great reason why you should invite a toad into your garden: they can help manage pests and keep your plants alive and thriving! </p>
<p> Why do toads eat other toads and frogs? </p>
<p> Not every toad eats other toads and frogs. But there are some species – the Cane toad and American toad for example – that are cannibalistic. </p>
<p> If one of these toads is hungry then it won’t be at all picky about what it eats. If it is a smaller toad or frog and it fits in their mouth, they will eat it! </p>
<p> So, be sure to never put Cane toads and American toads in a terrarium with smaller frogs or toads. The little ones will probably get eaten! </p>

<p> What Do Wild Turkeys Eat? </p>
<p> Discover the Diet of a Wild Turkey </p>
<p> Melissa Mayntz has been a birder and wild bird enthusiast for 30+ years. She has over 16 years experience writing about wild birds for magazines and websites. </p>
<p> Turkeys are common guests on the dinner table, particularly for holiday meals such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, but what would wild turkeys eat if they could plan the menu? Learning about turkeys' preferred foods can help birders better understand these birds' foraging habits and where to find turkeys throughout the year when different food sources are available. </p>
<p> Foods They Eat </p>
<p> Wild turkeys are opportunistically omnivorous, which means they will readily sample a wide range of foods, both animal and vegetable. They forage frequently and will eat many different things, including: </p>
<p> Acorns, hickory nuts, beechnuts, or walnuts, either cracked open or swallowed whole </p>
<p> Seeds and grain, including spilled birdseed or corn and wheat in agricultural fields </p>
<p> Fleshy plant parts such as buds, roots, bulbs, succulents, and cacti </p>
<p> Plant foliage, grass, and tender young leaves or shoots </p>
<p> Large insects including grasshoppers, spiders, and caterpillars </p>
<p> Snails, slugs, and worms </p>
<p> Sand and small gravel for grit to aid proper digestion </p>
<p> In captivity or in agricultural settings, domestic turkeys—which are the same genetic species as wild turkeys—are often fed a special commercial feed formulated for game birds, turkeys, or poultry. These commercial feeds typically contain a mix of material to simulate these birds' highly varied diets. Many turkey farmers also supplement their flock's feeding with additional corn, grain, or other foods. The diet of domestic turkeys is often formulated to encourage heavier birds and faster growth to increase commercial profits. Some farmers, however, focus on heritage turkey breeds and offer a more natural diet for the birds to eat, including allowing them to forage freely through pastures and fields. </p>
<p> How They Eat </p>
<p> Wild turkeys forage constantly, always seeking out a new meal or snack. They are most frequently found feeding for several hours in the early morning just after sunrise, and will also feed more actively several hours before darkness. If food is scarce they will forage at any time of day, and when the flock includes young, hungry chicks, they are more often foraging throughout the day as well. </p>
<p> While foraging, a wild turkey will scratch with both feet, alternating to use each foot one at a time, then pecking at the ground to find whatever has been uncovered. They will occasionally pluck fruit or other foods directly off plants, but only rarely forage while perched in trees. A turkey swallows its food whole and the material is stored in the bird's crop to be digested little by little with the help of the gizzard. After feeding, turkeys will often roost quietly for several hours while they digest. </p>
<p> How Their Diet Varies </p>
<p> Though turkeys will eat many different things, their diets can be influenced by a number of factors, such as: </p>
<p> Season: Turkeys, like all animals, select food sources that are most abundant and easiest to reach. When different foods are abundant in different seasons, turkeys adjust their diets accordingly. In spring, they eat more fresh buds, grasses, and similar plant material, while insects and berries are more popular fare in summer. In autumn and winter, nuts, fruits, and grains make up the bulk of a wild turkey's diet. </p>
<p> Geography: A bird's location greatly influences the foods it can find. Wild turkeys that are found in more forested ranges will have a higher percentage of nuts and buds in their diet. Turkeys that are in more open, desert regions may rely on more reptiles, seeds, and cacti for their nutrition. In agricultural regions, wild turkeys can often find much more grain to eat, and may even be considered a nuisance or pest in farmers' fields. </p>
<p> Age: Young wild turkeys can forage for themselves very quickly, and the hen will lead her brood to the best available food sources. For the first month of the birds' lives, they eat a much higher percentage of insects, mollusks, reptiles, or other meat to get the protein essential for healthy growth. As they age they try a wider variety of foods and transition to a more varied diet depending on what is available. Adult wild turkeys eat mostly plant matter but still take advantage of any easily available food, including meat. </p>
<p> Feeding Turkeys </p>
<p> Wild turkeys are not common as backyard birds, but birders who live near wooded areas may find these large game birds foraging near their feeders. To provide an adequate feeding area for wild turkeys: </p>
<p> Opt for ground feeding areas or large, low platform feeders that can accommodate these large birds and the flocks they forage in. Turkey scratching can damage turf or delicate landscaped beds, however, so plan a feeding area in a spot you don't mind getting torn up or trampled. </p>
<p> Provide cracked corn, millet, milo, wheat, oats, or other seeds and grains. Wild turkeys are not picky and will readily eat less expensive birdseed mixes or will eat the waste seed scattered beneath bird feeders. Leave leaf litter available for the birds to forage, and leave windfall fruit and nuts on the ground for turkeys to find. </p>
<p> Plant oak or beech trees along with grapes, cherry trees, crabapples, hackberries, and similar trees and shrubs to provide an inexpensive, natural, renewable food source for wild turkeys. Native plants are best because the turkeys will recognize them more easily, and the plants will require less care to produce abundant crops to feed a hungry flock. </p>
<p> Minimize or eliminate herbicides and insecticides that could contaminate foods wild turkeys eat, particularly during the summer when young birds are more susceptible to toxic chemicals. Instead, allow turkeys to forage freely and they will eat many bothersome insects. </p>
<p> Wild turkeys are large game birds with healthy appetites, and they sate those appetites with a wide variety of different foods. Birders who know what wild turkeys eat can more easily plan how to find these game birds in the field by visiting areas where food is abundant. It is even possible to provide a spot for wild turkeys at a backyard bird-friendly buffet instead of focusing on these birds at the center of a holiday dinner table. </p>

<p> What Do Woodchucks Eat? </p>
<p> Woodchuck is a colloquial name for a fun little animal that is also sometimes considered a pest, the groundhog. A woodchuck can quickly wreak havoc on a home vegetable garden, or even on a decorative garden. </p>
<p> Humane traps are one of the common ways to rid yourself of the pesky animal. These type of traps require something to bait the animal, so it would be helpful to know just what do woodchucks eat. This is also helpful if you plan on starting your own vegetable or fruit garden. </p>
<p> So What Do Woodchucks Eat? </p>
<p> Woodchucks like a variety of plants which I soon found out after they invaded my vegetable garden. Herbaceous plants and sweet fruits are high on their list. Liking herbaceous plants explains why they might sometimes target a decorative garden. Flowers in this category are: </p>
<p> A group of woodchucks can destroy a garden in short order if not dealt with in a timely manner. Before you start your vegetable garden, it is a good idea to use a repellent to control the wildlife. Once they are on your property, then traps are used. </p>
<p> How To Trap Woodchucks </p>
<p> Since we know what do woodchucks eat, we can bait the traps. For best results, use gloves of some sort when baiting and setting traps. That way, you don’t leave a bunch of icky human scent all over everything. </p>
<p> Cantaloupe seems to work best. Besides being a sweet fruit, it has a long lasting odor. The woodchucks like it fresh or older. Cut in chunks about 2 inches or so, a cube of cut cantaloupe. Take a piece of the fruit and rub it all over the parts of the trap. This helps cover any scent the woodchuck may be cautious about. </p>
<p> Place the trap about 3 or 4 feet from the opening you detected as their lair. A couple of small bits of fruit can be left just outside the hole, and create a short trail of bits to the trap. </p>
<p> It may take a few attempts to successfully trap the critter. If your yard has several of them, it will also take time to complete the operation. After trapping, relocation is an option you have to be done with them. Check online for good areas, and be sure to check with local authorities concerning the legalities of any course of action you take. </p>
<p> Do woodchucks eat wood? </p>
<p> No, not really. Maybe someone had seen one chewing on a softer plant and thought it was. The name woodchuck more likely comes from the Native American words for the common groundhog. In Cree, the word sounded like otchek, in Algonquin it was closer to wuchak. </p>
<p> No matter how much wood you throw at a woodchuck, it’s going to prefer a tasty cantaloupe or ear of corn over a chucked chunk of wood. Cantaloupe doesn’t make near as cute a rhyme, though. </p>
<p> How much cantaloupe would a woodchuck eat, or just what do woodchucks eat? See? Doesn’t rhyme at all, actually. </p>
<p> Now that you know the food they prefer, you can deal with them and stop them from ruining your garden. You also have some fun facts to throw out at those garden club trivia contests! If you’d like to make the most of your garden, you can check out my post on the best tumbler composters. Thanks for reading! </p>

<doc id="file21599745" filename="what-fruits-can-diabetics-eat" parent_folder="web2" url="https://medicaltrend.org/2021/06/15/what-fruits-can-diabetics-eat/">
<p> What fruits can diabetics eat? </p>
<p> What fruits can diabetics eat? Can diabetics not eat fruit? Fear of diabetes, it’s not that you can’t eat or eat less fruit! </p>
<p> When you eat fruit, you should also monitor your blood sugar level. If you find that your blood sugar has soared, you still need to control the fruit. Don’t make your blood sugar soar because of your gluttony. </p>
<p> Poor eating habits, such as regular consumption of sugary drinks, are one of the risk factors for diabetes. As a result, many people believe that diabetic patients or people who prevent diabetes need to eat less sugary foods. Fruits and juices with excessive sugar content are the first to bear the brunt. </p>
<p> However, recently, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, a well-known journal in the field of endocrinology, has Subvert this statement. </p>
<p> Studies have found that higher fruit consumption is associated with a reduced risk of diabetes; while drinking fruit juice has no effect on the risk of diabetes. Regular consumption of fruits is associated with decreased serum insulin levels, decreased β-cell function, and increased insulin sensitivity. </p>
<p> In other words, eating more fruits can also prevent diabetes! </p>
<p> Can diabetics eat fruit? </p>
<p> In fact, for diabetic patients, eating some fruits in moderation is still beneficial to health. </p>
<p> Diabetics choose fruits mainly with reference to the growth index of food. Under normal circumstances, foods with a glycemic index higher than 70% should be carefully selected, and a glycemic index less than 50% can be eaten in moderation. </p>
<p> Studies have found that some fruits have relatively low glycemic index. If you choose to eat some between meals, you can meet the needs of diabetic patients for vitamins in fruits. </p>
<p> For diabetic patients with cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis, you can choose to eat more fruits that are rich in vitamin C and potassium, which can help reduce the permeability of capillaries and promote iron. Absorption, promote hematopoietic function, help maintain the stability of blood lipids and blood pressure, and care for blood vessel health. </p>
<p> In 2013, Danish nutritionists found that patients with type 2 diabetes who ate more fruits had exactly the same blood sugar control as those who ate less fruits. </p>
<p> Suggest: </p>
<p> ① Try to choose 2 hours after the meal, which can be eaten as a snack. </p>
<p> ②Try to choose fruits that have more water, low sugar content, and have little effect on blood sugar fluctuations (low GI). For example: apple, strawberry, watermelon, grapefruit, peach, etc. </p>
<p> ③The amount of a single meal: The amount of fruit eaten each time should be controlled at 50-100 g. </p>
<p> People with diabetes may wish to eat the following 5 kinds of fruits frequently to find out </p>
<p> Pomegranate </p>
<p> Pomegranate is commonly known as guava. It can be eaten fresh and can be processed into juice. Although pomegranate tastes a bit sweet, its glycemic index is not high. Eating some pomegranate in moderation can also maintain blood sugar stability in the body. It has a certain effect of lowering blood pressure and blood lipids, and the active ingredients may be flavonoids. </p>
<p> Pear </p>
<p> Pears contain a large amount of dietary fiber intake. The human body can promote gastrointestinal motility in the future, which is beneficial to the discharge of oil and sugar. It has a certain auxiliary effect on maintaining blood sugar stability. Eating some pears in an appropriate amount is still good for lowering blood sugar. </p>
<p> Grapefruit </p>
<p> Grapefruit has the effect of lowering blood sugar. Fresh grapefruit meat contains ingredients similar to insulin, which can help lower blood sugar. </p>
<p> And for patients with high blood pressure, grapefruit is also a good choice, which contains natural mineral potassium and almost no sodium, high potassium and low sodium, this fruit is especially suitable for patients with cardiovascular diseases. </p>
<p> Apple </p>
<p> Apples are rich in natural pectin, which is good for health, and if you choose to eat boiled apples, it can help lower blood sugar. </p>
<p> After the apple is heated, increase the day classification. The content of natural antioxidants can make blood sugar more stable, and the chromium contained in apples can increase insulin sensitivity and help reduce blood sugar. However, boiled apples can only help reduce blood sugar. , Can not replace hypoglycemic drugs. </p>
<p> Plum </p>
<p> Plum is a low-sugar fruit with a sugar content of about 8% to 10%. It is rich in water, organic acid vitamins and various minerals. </p>
<p> Plum does not have the effect of lowering blood sugar. It is just a low-sugar fruit, rich in pectin dietary fiber, which can promote gastrointestinal motility and accelerate the excretion of toxins from the body. </p>
<p> Tips: </p>
<p> For diabetic patients, although it is possible to eat fruit appropriately, you must choose the right time when eating fruit. Try to arrange fruit eating before lunch in the morning, two hours or after lunch in the afternoon, two or three hours and in the evening. Not only can it achieve the effect of invigorating the spleen and appetizing appetite, but it can also avoid the spike in blood sugar after a blood meal. </p>
<p> And the expert advises to monitor blood sugar level when eating fruit. If you find a spike in blood sugar, you still need to control the fruit. Don’t make your blood sugar soar because of your gluttony. </p>

<p> If you’re wondering what fruits you can offer your gecko, you should first know if your gecko is frugivorous, or insectivorous. </p>
<p> Frugivorous – animals that eat fruit </p>
<p> Insectivorous – animals that eat insects </p>
<p> Some gecko species are actually omnivorous, meaning they feed on both fruits and animals. The most common omnivore in world of captive geckos is the crested gecko. Crested geckos feed on fruits, nectars, and insects in the wild. An omnivore can actually be a frugivore. </p>
<p> Is your gecko frugivorous? </p>
<p> Some common frugivorous gecko species include: crested geckos, gargoyle geckos, chahoua geckos, leachianus, mourning geckos, day geckos, and Eurydactylodes </p>
<p> So, what fruits can you feed your frugivorous gecko? </p>
<p> Geckos that are not frugivorous: leopard geckos, African fat tailed geckos, tokays, Binoe’s geckos, strophurus, nephrurus species, house geckos, flying geckos, frog eyed geckos, cave geckos and more </p>
<p> So, what fruits can you feed your frugivorous gecko? </p>
<p> How To Prepare Fruits For Geckos </p>
<p> It is best to stick with specifically formulated geckos diets from reputable brands like Repashy, Pangea, and Zoo Med. Offering fruit to your gecko should only be done as a treat, or no more than once a week. Real fruits will offer essential vitamins and minerals for your gecko, but gecko diets are fortified with precise amounts of vital nutrients, and are carefully balanced to yield an optimal calcium to phosphorus ratio. </p>
<p> Step 1: Wash the surface of the fruits thoroughly to remove any contaminants </p>
<p> Step 2: Remove all pits and large seeds (pits can contribute to impaction for gecko species) </p>
<p> Step 2: Blend a small amount of fruit together (you can mix things like banana, papaya, fig, melon and berries to create a gourmet raw food treat) </p>
<p> Step 3: Dab a little bit of fruit puree into a feeding dish </p>
<p> Step 4: (Optional, but strongly encouraged) stir in a small amount of phosphorus free calcium with D3 reptile supplement. This is important if you are only offering bananas. </p>
<p> Step 5: Serve! </p>
<p> What About Calcium and Phosphorus? </p>
<p> Many fruits not listed do not have an ideal ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Foods too high in phosphorus can deplete bioavailable calcium through a hormonal imbalance (source). In theory, if you strictly fed fruits either listed above you could create a nutritional deficiency leading to metabolic bone disease (MBD), or other issues with your gecko. The reason many fruits, particularly citrus fruits, are not on the list is because they may be too high in phosphorus or oxalates. It is strongly encouraged to always mix phosphorus free calcium supplement with fruits when not feeding a formulated gecko diet. </p>
<p> Foods that are high in phosphorus include: </p>
<p> Nuts/seeds – Avoid </p>
<p> Whole grains – Avoid </p>
<p> Soy – Avoid </p>
<p> Bananas – *Supplement with calcium </p>
<p> *Bananas contain 4 times as much phosphorus as calcium and should be mixed with a calcium and D3 supplement when offered to geckos </p>
<p> Why You Should Avoid Foods High In Oxalic Acid </p>
<p> Oxalates affect how minerals like calcium, and magnesium are metabolized. Oxalic acid found in many foods, including some fruits, binds with calcium molecules and forms calcium oxalate which can not be digested or metabolised. Offering foods high in oxalic acid can deplete calcium bio availability leading to Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD), and Floppy Tail Syndrome (FTS). This is why the leading gecko diets are formulated with low oxalic acid containing fruits. </p>

<p> What's not to love about fruit? It's basically nature's candy—providing the perfect topper for your breakfast cereal, a convenient snack when you're on the run, and a healthy dessert you can feel good about eating. Whether you enjoy some sliced banana with your overnight oats or some berries in your Greek yogurt, you may be wondering how your habits affect your health—and what happens to your body when you eat fruit is actually pretty amazing. As they say, an apple a day keeps the doctor away, and there are definitely are a ton of perks to eating these foods. However, experts say the key to reaping the benefits without any negative effects is heeding the old mantra "everything in moderation." </p>
<p> "In the short term, when we eat fruit, we immediately ingest dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, water, electrolytes, phytochemicals and antioxidants," says Brooke Glazer, RDN, nutrition consultant for RSP Nutrition. "Long term, sufficient intake of fruits is linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Eating fruit is also associated with weight management and a reduced risk of obesity." </p>
<p> Pretty impressive, right? But that's not all that eating fruit does to your body. Here's what you need to know. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Your blood sugar will increase. </p>
<p> According to certified nutritionist Paul Claybrook (MS, MBA, CN), fruit can raise your insulin levels because as you digest the carbohydrates it contains, your blood sugar naturally increases. </p>
<p> "Don't worry, this is not a bad thing," says Claybrook. "Most fruits have at least a moderate glycemic index, which ultimately means that it's a more gradual increase in blood sugar followed by a steady decrease—the way it's supposed to be." </p>
<p> This is because the sugar found in fruit isn't the same you'd find in a donut or a soda, which is absorbed almost instantly. Claybrook explains that the chains of sugar in fruit have to be broken down by your digestive system before they can enter your bloodstream, which takes some time, thus preventing a sudden spike. </p>
<p> However, that's assuming you eat a moderate amount of fruit. The ideal amount of fruit to consume depends on your age, gender, and level of physical activity—but Glazer recommends aiming for about two to three servings of whole fruit per day. If you overdo it in one sitting, Claybrook says that could cause your blood sugar to go up too much. </p>
<p> "When you consume a lot of fruit, you are getting a constant flow of lots of sugar rather than a constant flow of some sugar like you would with a normal serving size," he explains. "As a single event, this isn't much of an issue but binging on fruit frequently could be a problem." </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> You may get (temporarily) bloated. </p>
<p> Don't be alarmed if you feel slightly bloated immediately after eating fruit. While this is one of the more unpleasant side effects, experts say it's pretty common. </p>
<p> Vive Nutrition founder Andres Ayesta (MS, RD, LD, CSCS, CSSD) notes that you're more likely to experience bloating and indigestion when you eat fruit in excess—which is why he emphasizes that moderation is key. However, you may still notice some mild bloating even after eating a normal portion size. </p>
<p> "This is due to fruit's high fiber content and can also cause bloating for individuals who have difficulty breaking down a particular fruit," explains Glazer. "But remember, bloating does not equal weight gain and eating whole fruit is not associated with weight gain." </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> You'll get a hefty dose of antioxidants. </p>
<p> By now, you've probably heard of antioxidants—these substances have long been hailed for their cancer-fighting, anti-aging benefits. Well, many fruits are chock full of them. In particular, Ayesta says citrus fruits are high in vitamin c, mangoes are packed with beta carotene, watermelon is loaded with lycopene, and berries and apples boast lots of other important antioxidants. </p>
<p> "Antioxidants act as scavengers in the body to clean up free radicals," explains Glazer. "Free radicals (are molecules that) cause damage and lead to disease development and advanced aging. So, eating colorful fruits that are rich in antioxidants keep us healthy and young." </p>
<p> Claybrook adds that antioxidants also both boost your immune system as well as decrease inflammation. </p>
<p> "They help the immune system by eliminating a lot of free radicals that the immune system would normally have to deal with," he explains. "Your immune system can only do so many things at once and if it can't keep up with all the free radicals and some end up reacting with, say DNA, you could end up with cancer." </p>
<p> Since each type of antioxidant has different health benefits, Glazer recommends switching up what kinds of fruit you're eating on the daily. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> You'll probably feel full. </p>
<p> While fruit only really has trace amounts of protein, it can still be surprisingly satiating. According to experts, this is because it's high in both water and fiber. </p>
<p> "Fiber creates 'bulk' and thus slows down the digestion of any food," says Claybrook. "When fiber sucks up water, it gets much bigger and once your stomach stretches enough, you feel full." </p>
<p> Ayesta adds that both the fiber and water content contribute to a lot of volume in your stomach, thus giving you the feeling of fullness without providing a ton of calories. </p>
<p> "A cup of pineapple contains roughly 80 calories and can be a satiating snack or 'dessert' after a meal making you feel satisfied while also providing hydration, fiber, and vitamins and minerals." </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> You'll get hydrated. </p>
<p> Did you know that an apple is 85% water? Or that strawberries are made up of approximately 92% water? Since fruits are rich in water content, they can definitely aid in hydration — especially varieties like melon and pineapple, according to Ayesta. </p>
<p> "While you usually eat fruit, you are actually getting far more water than anything else," says Claybrook. </p>
<p> That makes fruit an ideal post-workout snack or quick pick-me-up on a sweltering summer's day. </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> You'll help your body perform basic functions. </p>
<p> Your body relies on certain vitamins and minerals to function properly—and fortunately, fruit is loaded with lots of essential nutrients. </p>
<p> "Fruit provides a variety of vitamins and minerals that aid the body in hundreds of metabolic processes," explains Ayesta. "For example, the potassium in bananas aid in nerve signals, muscle contraction, and fluid balance." </p>
<p> The bottom line? Eating fruit helps your body to work more efficiently. </p>

<p> What Happens If You Eat Food That Fell on the Floor? </p>
<p> The situation: You're prepping dinner, and a juicy tomato slice slips off the cutting board and onto the kitchen floor you haven't mopped in a month. You scoop it back up and throw it the salad bowl, because tomatoes aren't cheap—and hey, aren't you protected by the 5-Second Rule? </p>
<p> What you're worried about: contracting some bowel-razing strain of Salmonella, E. coli, or another illness-causing bug (that all lead to food recalls.). After all, you've been trampling on that floor in the same shoes you've worn…well, you don't even want to think about all the subway stairs, city streets, or dirty fields they've crossed. </p>
<p> flas100/shutterstock </p>
<p> The very worst that could happen: Germaphobes, you're allowed to say I told you so. Turns out fallen food does pick up germs immediately upon making contact with the floor, and the amount of bacteria transferred can be enough to make you sick, according to Paul Dawson, PhD, a food science professor at Clemson University. (These 5 foods are so dangerous that they're illegal in the United States.) </p>
<p> Dawson should know: He actually went so far as to test the 5-Second Rule in a study, which was published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology in 2007. He and his team dropped slices of bologna and bread onto floors contaminated with Salmonella, let them sit for varying amounts of time, and recorded exactly how many bugs moved from floor to food. When the edibles were dropped on wood or tile and left there for 5 seconds, anywhere from 48% to 70% of bacteria from the floor made it onto the food. (Score one, though, if you're the rare person who has carpeting in the kitchen: Less than 1% of bacteria were transferred to food dropped on rugs.) </p>
<p> Before you freak out, know that bacteria on your food becomes a problem if—and only if—the microbes on the floor are actually the kind that can make you sick, like Salmonella. Then, your food would have to fall directly on top of those bugs to really transfer. And harmful bacteria isn't necessarily on your kitchen floors—you'd have to bring home contaminated food for there to even be a chance. (Like when the FDA found human waste in this food.) </p>
<p> adriana nikolova/shutterstock </p>
<p> But if you do have contaminated goodies at home, it's actually pretty easy for bacteria to end up on your floor—in other words, you don't have to mop your floor with a raw chicken breast to create risk. Some strains of E. coli are so powerful, in fact, that it can take as few as 10 cells to cause illness. So even while the possibility of getting sick is still slim, if you have a compromised immune system, don't take any chances by eating food that's been on the floor, Dawson says. </p>
<p> What will probably happen: Nothing. "The odds are extremely low of getting sick from eating fallen food," Dawson says. And since the majority of the food you bring into your kitchen isn't contaminated with illness-causing bugs, you'll likely be just fine if you eat a slice of toast from your kitchen tile. But to minimize your risk, consider staying on top of food recalls from the FDA by singing up for its regular email alerts here.) Then, if you hear a product is being recalled for bacterial contamination, you can toss it before it has the chance to infect your floors. Of course, regularly cleaning your kitchen helps, too, so about once a week, give counters and floors a good scrub, then follow with a disinfectant, says Dawson. </p>

<p> What could actually happen to you if you eat food past its expiration date </p>
<p> You should always examine your food before eating it to check for signs of mold or strange smells. </p>
<p> But in many cases, you won't be able to see bacteria that could cause food poisoning or illness. </p>
<p> When uncertain about whether or not a food is still safe to consume, experts say you're probably better off erring on the side of caution. </p>
<p> Most of us have probably eaten foods knowing they're past their expiration date. And sometimes we do it accidentally as it can be a bit tricky to determine which items are worth actually tossing, especially if food still seems OK or if the expiration date has rubbed off. </p>
<p> But in many cases, consuming food a day or two past its best by date isn't the worst idea. Registered dietitian Jenn Fillenworth suggested that eating and drinking these items usually come with no set-backs whatsoever. </p>
<p> "Expiration dates on food can be quite confusing," said Fillenworth "I myself have consumed many items past their expiration date with no consequences." </p>
<p> However, that's not to say that eating expired food is without risk. Eating expired foods or foods that are past their best-by date can expose your body to harmful bacteria that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and a fever. </p>
<p> To help break down exactly what happens when you eat expired food, we spoke to experts about some important things to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to eat food past its expiration date </p>
<p> At best, nothing will occur when you eat food a few days after its use-by or best-by date </p>
<p> "There are three types of dates typically listed on food items: the best if used-by date, the sell-by date, and the use-by date," Fillenworth said. All of these phrases indicate that the product should be sold or consumed by this particular date to ensure the best tasting and freshest product possible, she explained. </p>
<p> Fillenworth said that most of the time, and in the case of certain foods, nothing will happen when you eat food that is a little past the use-by or best-by date. </p>
<p> "The US Department of Agriculture states that canned and other shelf-stable foods, as well as frozen foods, will be safe to eat past these dates, however they may become stale or develop an off-flavor in the case of some items such as cereals," she told INSIDER. </p>
<p> That being said, when consuming food past its suggested date, the food could lose some of its nutritional value. </p>
<p> "Fresher food is usually very nutritious," said board-certified cardiologist Dr. Luiza Petre. Food past its prime window of freshness will see a decrease in key nutrients, she suggested, and the longer it sits, the less nutritious it may become. </p>
<p> At worst, you could develop food poisoning or be exposed to dangerous amounts of harmful bacteria </p>
<p> "If you do eat a food past the expiration date [and the food] is spoiled, you could develop symptoms of food poisoning," said registered dietitian nutritionist Summer Yule, MS. The symptoms of foodborne illness can include fever, chills, stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. </p>
<p> "If you eat expired food, it may contain dangerous amounts of harmful bacteria such as E. coli and Bacteroides," added Dr. Clare Morrison of MedExpress. She said this can result in abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and perhaps even a fever. </p>
<p> Notably, some bacterial toxins found in expired food can be life-threatening. Dr. Morrison also told INSIDER that eating contaminated food also poses the risk of exposure to bacterial toxins, which damage the kidneys, possibly leading to a life-threatening situation. </p>
<p> So you'll want to eat expired foods with caution, especially when it comes to foods that are you're typically more at risk from getting food poisoning from. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this list includes foods like spinach and poultry. </p>
<p> In terms of checking for signs a food has expired, it's especially important to pay attention to perishable foods </p>
<p> Keeping track of when you buy items could also help you to determine whether or not they are still fresh. </p>
<p> "Perishable foods like dairy, deli meats, and uncooked meats demand customers to adhere closely to their expiration dates, as there is a risk of bacterial growth that could lead to foodborne illnesses," Dr. Petre said. Some of the most common types of food to monitor closely are deli meats, eggs, mixed greens, fresh berries, and soft cheese, she suggested. </p>
<p> Ultimately, always examine your food before eating it but keep in mind that harmful, illness-causing bacterias won't be visible </p>
<p> "The best way to know if your food is still edible is to perform a visual exam. Check for any mold and smell the product," said Fillenworth. She said you can also taste the product if you're willing and if there is something off from the normal taste, stop eating it and toss it. </p>
<p> But if you're not quite sure about whether or not you should still eat potentially expired food, err on the side of caution. </p>
<p> "The general rule is when in doubt, throw it out," Yule told INSIDER. Bulging cans and foods that do not smell or look like they are supposed to need to go in the trash, she added. </p>

<p> Here’s What Actually Happens If You Eat Moldy Food, According To Doctors </p>
<p> Few things are as horror-inducing as biting into a piece of fruit and noticing a patch of colorful, fuzzy mold. (Insert internal screams here.) </p>
<p> It feels like a betrayal—and suddenly you're spitting out that chunk of your precious apple or holding your moldy slice of bread over the garbage can, contemplating calling your mom for her to reassure you that nothing too terrible happens if you eat mold. </p>
<p> Whether you’re tempted to rinse out your mouth with Listerine for a good 10 minutes or just cut around the mold and keep chomping away, know this: Eating moldy food probably won't do you too much harm, let alone kill you, according to Rudolph Bedford, MD, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica. </p>
<p> Actually, sad and grossed out as you may be about eating (or almost eating) that blue fuzz, you'll probably be fine, he says. </p>
<p> However, there are a few things you should keep in mind when it comes to dealing with (and, gulp, ingesting) moldy food—especially considering that, on rare occasions, it can actually make you sick. </p>
<p> Before you brazenly continue noshing on your fruit or popping that toast in the toaster, here's the low-down on everything that can happen if you eat mold. </p>
<p> Give it to me straight. What happens if I eat mold? </p>
<p> Don't run to the bathroom to scrub your tongue with a bar of soap just yet. “You’re not going to die from eating mold,” says Dr. Bedford. In fact, as long as your immune system is in good shape, you can digest it like any other food. </p>
<p> This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site. </p>
<p> Though molds (a.k.a. microscopic fungi)—which creep up on plant and animal products after being transported there by air, water, or insects—can be dangerous, they usually aren’t, according to the USDA. </p>
<p> After all, molds are actually meant to be on certain foods—including dry-cured country hams and cheeses such as blue cheese, Gorgonzola, Brie, and Camembert. In many of these cases, mold is totally safe to eat, the USDA says. </p>
<p> But what about the fuzzy green or white stuff that pops up unannounced on fruits, vegetables, bread, and dairy products? </p>
<p> You might feel sick after accidentally eating these molds, but that's most likely because the mold tastes bad, not because of any particular toxin in it, says Dr. Bedford. </p>
<p> Even then, he recommends waiting to see if your symptoms escalate beyond nausea before rushing to call the doctor. “The stomach is a harsh environment, so, for the most part, most bacteria and fungus won't survive,” he explains. </p>
<p> But what if I do get super sick from eating moldy food? </p>
<p> “It’s very uncommon that you’re going to get [really] sick from mold,” says Dr. Bedford. And in the rare instance that you do, you'll likely have had to consume large amounts of the stuff. (And, c'mon, are you really going to keep licking the fuzz off your food? I didn't think so.) </p>
<p> If the unlikely occurs, though, and your symptoms include persistent nausea and vomiting, you should definitely call the doctor, Dr. Bedford says. Typically, he'd just prescribe anti-nausea medication—but if you're really feeling miserable, he might prescribe something to induce vomiting or diarrhea to try to flush out your system. </p>
<p> In some cases, people have allergic reactions to certain molds, which can contribute to respiratory issues, says Dr. Bedford. But don't worry, they're usually temporary and easily treated by your doctor. </p>
<p> Ultimately, though, don't get too freaked out: In his 30 years of practice, Dr. Bedford says he has never seen anyone die or require more intense treatment due to mold (though that doesn't mean it's impossible). </p>
<p> Just take mold as a sign that your food’s gone bad and move on. </p>
<p> Wait, can't I just cut the mold off of my food? </p>
<p> If you're not too skeeved out by that patch of mold on your eats, you might be tempted to just cut it off and continue eating, but whether or not this is actually a good idea depends on the food. </p>
<p> Though we only see their fuzzy discolored tops, all molds have “roots” that invade foods, according to the USDA. Since these roots allow toxins (if there are any) to spread throughout the inside of your food, your best move is to throw out the moldy food in its entirety, regardless of where you see the moldy patch, Dr. Bedford says. </p>
<p> Still, mold can't penetrate certain hard cheeses, hard salami, firm fruits, and vegetables as easily as softer foods, the USDA says. That makes these foods easier to save from a fuzzy patch. Just make sure to cut off at least an inch around and below the moldy spot, keep your knife out of the mold, and wrap the “good” part of the food in a new covering. </p>
<p> For quick reference, these food are generally okay to eat once you cut off any mold: </p>
<p> Hard cheeses </p>
<p> Hard salami </p>
<p> Firm fruits </p>
<p> Vegetables </p>
<p> These foods, meanwhile, should be thrown away if at all moldy: </p>
<p> Also, FYI, toasting your bread will not kill the mold on it, so don't even go there. Since bread is super porous, it's definitely one to chuck at the first sign of fuzz, says the USDA. </p>
<p> How can I prevent mold from forming in the first place? </p>
<p> Since warm, humid conditions encourage mold growth—and dry mold spores float through the air in search of new places in which to grow some more moldy friends—the USDA recommends a few best practices for keeping mold from messing with your food: </p>
<p> Examine foods for mold before buying them </p>
<p> Purchase food in small amounts so mold doesn't have time to grow </p>
<p> Stash food in the refrigerator quickly </p>
<p> Eat leftovers within three or four days </p>
<p> Clean your refrigerator regularly </p>
<p> Of course, molds can still grow in the refrigerator (albeit much more slowly), but following these guidelines can help keep your eats fresh and fuzz-free for as long as possible. </p>
<p> The bottom line: Eating moldy food probably won't make you sick, but most foods should be thrown away at the first sign of fuzz. To prevent mold growth, properly wrap all food and store it in a clean, dry refrigerator. </p>

<p> What Happens If You Eat Mold? </p>
<p> So those strawberries in the back of your refrigerator were a little past their prime, huh? </p>
<p> Eating mold sounds pretty scary, but chances are you've probably done it once or twice without even realizing it. When cleaning out your fridge, you toss the obvious, clearly ancient items coated in something that's green, gray, or fuzzy, and almost always gross. </p>
<p> But what if you reallllly want to eat the rest of that cheese? Or, worse, what if you miss it and accidentally eat mold? </p>
<p> What is mold, exactly? </p>
<p> Mold is microscopic fungi that can grow on plants or animal materials, according to the United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA). It grows in a threadlike shape with branches and roots that can grow deep into a food. Mold spores are the reproductive "seeds" of mold that can travel through the air and land on substances, and then grow into mold. </p>
<p> Is mold dangerous? </p>
<p> Yes and no. While some types of mold have no effect on your health at all, others can cause allergic reactions and respiratory infections. The latter is typically the case with "black mold," which is more likely to be found in wet building materials than food (thankfully!) and can lead to a particularly dangerous type of respiratory infection. (More on that here: Are Those Allergy Symptoms Triggered By Hidden Mold in Your Home?) </p>
<p> Other types of mold can produce poisonous substances that can make you sick. Known as mycotoxins, these invisible molecules are most commonly found on grains and fresh produce and are considered relatively unavoidable by the USDA. Molds can also be found in the air, in our refrigerators, on counter-tops, and even the sponges we clean with, according to Carla Gervasio, a doctor of Oriental medicine. </p>
<p> On the other hand, certain foods are moldy by nature and actually require mold to grow properly. Blue-veined cheese such as Roquefort, blue, Gorgonzola, and Stilton are created by the introduction of P.roqueforti or Penicillium roqueforti spores, specifically, which are safe to eat and are essential for manufacturing these specific types of cheeses. </p>
<p> Is it safe to eat moldy food? </p>
<p> Raise your hand ? if you usually just chop off the moldy spot and move on. Same. However, because molds grow in threadlike shapes with roots that can reach throughout the item, your safest bet is to just throw it away. </p>
<p> If you can't bear parting with that whole block of cheddar, there's some good news: Some foods, such as firm fruits and veggies (think: carrots and cabbage) and hard cheeses and salamis can be salvaged by cutting "at least 1 inch around and below the mold spot," according to the USDA. Just be sure to keep the knife out of the mold as to not spread the yuck. </p>
<p> Softer foods (such as bread) and those with higher moisture content (such as yogurt and jarred or canned goods) should definitely be discarded if you spot any mold, since it's easier for the mold to penetrate more deeply in these items versus harder foods. The same is true for meat and poultry; you should toss it. Uncooked meat and poultry have a high moisture content, making it easy for mold to spread, and cooked/leftover meat and poultry can have bacteria growing along with the mold, according to the USDA. </p>
<p> What happens if you accidentally eat mold? </p>
<p> Don't panic—chances are, not much. However, remember that mold is a tricky organism with the potential to cause disease. Your body's response to mold intake is almost entirely dependent on your immune system, says Marina Yuabova, D.N.P., a doctor of nursing practice and nurse practitioner in New York City. </p>
<p> "When the immune system works well, and healthy gut flora is abundant, molds will have no negative impact on the health and wellness of that individual," says Yuabova. "In the case of people whose immune systems are weak, ingested fungal spores could cause more severe issues. When fungal invasion becomes systemic, the fungus can invade the digestive tract, upper respiratory tract, and brain; those cases become more serious." </p>
<p> If you know you have a weak immune system (perhaps due to a chronic condition) or a history of asthma or allergies, it's a good idea to call your doctor and seek treatment, if necessary. (Eaten something included in a food recall? Here's what to do.) </p>
<p> Either way, you should definitely keep an eye out for symptoms of an adverse reaction, which can mimic those of food poisoning (ex: nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness), says Lisa Richards, a certified nutritionist and creator of the Candida Diet, which focuses on restoring the body's balance of healthy gut bacteria. Most of the time, if you accidentally consume mold, you should just let the symptoms pass, says Richards. "But if you notice gastrointestinal symptoms, it's a good idea to add a probiotic into your health regimen and follow a fairly bland diet to help replenish the healthy bacteria in your gut," she says. (BTW, here's how to spot the difference between food poisoning and the stomach flu.) </p>
<p> How can you keep food from getting moldy? </p>
<p> Two words: proper storage. </p>
<p> Mold loves humidity and warmth, but it can grow in virtually any environment—it can tolerate colder temps too, so refrigerated items are just as much at risk as those kept at room temperature. When the spores dry, they "float through the air and find suitable conditions where they can start the growth cycle again, according to the USDA. To prevent this, the USDA recommends that you keep food covered when serving, refrigerate any perishables promptly, avoid leaving food out for more than two hours, and keep both the refrigerator and pantry clean. (Related: Cleaning Products That Could Be Bad For Your Health—and What to Use Instead) </p>
<p> When you're grocery shopping, take care to examine your food before buying and avoid any bruised produce. Although bruised fruit doesn't always mean it's moldy, bruising is a breakdown in the cellular makeup of the fruit and does indicate some sort of damage, which can be an opportunity for mold to grow. It's also helpful to purchase food in smaller quantities, so you're more likely to eat it before anything grows and you're forced to waste leftovers. (Related: How to Use "Root to Stem" Cooking to Cut Down On Food Waste) </p>
<p> The bottom line? Mold is ever-present in our world and can even be beneficial to some foods (hello blue cheese!), and if you accidentally eat mold, you'll probably be fine. But, when in doubt, just toss it. </p>

<p> A vegan said she was 'poisoned for life' after accidentally eating meat. Here's the reality of what happens when you stop being vegan. </p>
<p> A vegan woman who was accidentally served a pork sausage roll said the experience traumatized her and poisoned her for life. </p>
<p> Nutritionally, adding meat to your diet isn't harmful unless you have an allergy, which is very rare. </p>
<p> Still, some people may have a sensitivity to certain foods or even anxiety related to what they eat, which can cause symptoms like heart palpitations and indigestion. </p>
<p> Sharleen Ndungu just wanted to enjoy a vegan sausage roll, a hugely popular meatless version of the beloved classic, at a Greggs bakery in the UK. </p>
<p> But a few bites in, she had heart palpitations and an upset stomach. As it turned out, she had been accidentally served the meat pastry, she told Vice this week. </p>
<p> Having been vegan for two years, Ndungu said she had a strong reaction to the meaty mistake. She told Vice that she refused a refund but was "traumatized" and "poisoned for life." </p>
<p> People may be vegan for many reasons, including for their health, religious values, or ethical and environmental concerns. As a result, accidentally eating meat can be upsetting on several levels. </p>
<p> But an unfortunate bite of meat won't hurt you if you're vegan — let alone cause lasting damage — unless you're one of the rare people with a severe meat allergy, a nutritionist told Insider. </p>
<p> Here's what actually happens when you stop being vegan, involuntarily or otherwise. </p>
<p> Eating meat after abstaining for years is rarely dangerous but could cause mental and physical reactions </p>
<p> Most of the time, when a vegan or vegetarian starts eating meat after a long period of abstaining, what happens is ... nothing, according to Robin Foroutan, a registered dietitian nutritionist and representative for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. </p>
<p> Some people may feel as though they have a harder time digesting meat if they aren't used to it, Foroutan said, but there's no scientific evidence for this. </p>
<p> There could also be a psychological element at play if people become anxious or even have a panic attack when they realize what they're eating, Foroutan said. </p>
<p> "Distress could be one cause of that kind of response," she said. </p>
<p> It's also possible that some vegans have a food sensitivity to meat, causing symptoms like headaches, bloating or gassiness, heartburn, or irritability. While food sensitivities are vague and poorly understood, they're believed to be a result of the wide variation in people's bodies and digestive systems. Eating specific foods may trigger inflammation or antibodies in some people. </p>
<p> But there's no reason to believe that a food sensitivity would cause any long-term side effects. </p>
<p> "The foods you eat don't stay in your body forever," Foroutan said. </p>
<p> Allergies to any type of meat are possible but uncommon, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Unlike a food sensitivity, a food allergy can be consistently diagnosed with a type of test to detect the presence of immunoglobulin, which is created by the immune system reacting to the allergen. </p>
<p> A particularly dangerous type of meat allergy can develop from an insect bite. People bitten by the Lone Star tick can become allergic to red meat and animal products, which could cause a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. This tick is found in the US, mostly in southeastern states. </p>
<p> For most people, meat can be a part of a healthy diet </p>
<p> The bottom line is that a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables is best for health, Foroutan said. Whether that includes some animal products is a matter of personal preference. </p>
<p> "There is no one dietary solution that works for everyone," she said. "I encourage people to eat mostly plants, foods high in antioxidants — and if you do eat animal products, get the highest quality available to you." </p>
<p> If you're considering a major shift in your diet, however, such as reintroducing certain foods, it's best to do so gradually if possible, Foroutan added. </p>
<p> "It's really important to pay attention to your body, what it needs, and how you're feeling," she said. "But as long as the bulk of the diet is plant-based, you'll be in good shape." </p>

<p> What Human Foods Can Cats Eat? </p>
<p> By Josie F. Turner, Journalist specialized in Animal Welfare. Updated: October 24, 2016 </p>
<p> Many of the foods we humans eat regularly are also suitable for cats. However, one basic premise that should always be observed is that these foods should not be raw or overly seasoned. Salt, sugar, pepper, vinegar and various other condiments are harmful to your cat's health. Even if your cat loves a particular seasoning, you shouldn't share that kind of dish. </p>
<p> Once that warning's been made, the truth is that sharing a human diet with a cat is actually quite easy. Continue reading this AnimalWised article to learn what human foods can cats eat. </p>
<p> Can cats eat meat? </p>
<p> The healthiest meat for cats is chicken - and it also happens to be a big favorite. Turkey is also good for cats. If you want to make your cat a homemade diet based on meat products, you should know that the best way to give your cat meat is boiled or roasted, without any oil. It is also advisable to completely remove bones, especially small ones. The skin should only be given to cats if they are malnourished. </p>
<p> Boiled chicken broth is strongly discouraged, because it is often cooked with leeks and other food that is harmful to cats. If your cat eats the meat that comes from the broth - which it will happily do - it will cause diarrhea and vomiting. </p>
<p> Rabbit and ground beef are acceptable for cats to eat; liver, if they like it, will provide lots of iron. On the other hand, pork doesn't sit too well with them, especially the fattier parts. </p>
<p> Can cats eat cured meats? </p>
<p> Cats lovecured meats, but you have to restrict how much and how often they eat them because they contain excessive amounts of salt or pepper. The most suitable cured meats for cats are sliced turkey and ham, both low in salt if possible. Although cats love them, cured meats should only be given on occasion. </p>
<p> Salami, chorizo and salted ham are big favorites, but they shouldn't be given to cats. As a last resort option, if you have run out of cat food you can give your pet a Frankfurt sausage. </p>
<p> Can cats eat fish? </p>
<p> The healthiest fish for cats are of the white and boneless kind. Salmon and trout are good, while tuna and sardines are also recommended because they contain Omega 3 and Omega 6 which are good for your cat's fur. </p>
<p> Fish should never be canned, as the oil and salt content are not suitable for cats. Therefore, you should always boil the fish or get rid of the oil on the plate before feeding it to your cat. Smoked fish is not suitable, even though cats like it a lot. </p>
<p> Can cats eat vegetables? </p>
<p> Potatoes and carrots are good for cats, which is why they are also on the list of human foods that cats can eat. The best way to feed them to your cat is to make a pie made of ground beef or poultry mixed with boiled potato and egg. If you add chicken liver, it will be a delicious and fresh dish for your cat. However, you should only give them part of the pie - freeze the rest in daily portions. </p>
<p> Pumpkin, peas and lettuce are good in small quantities, because sugar is not suitable for a cat's diet. </p>
<p> Cats are carnivores and generally use plants to help ease digestion. Therefore, even plants that are not harmful to cats should be given in moderation. </p>
<p> Can cats eat fruit? </p>
<p> Fruit contains a lot of sugar, so cats should only eat them in small amounts. You can give your cat melon and watermelon cut into small pieces so it can hydrate during the summer. Strawberries are also suitable for cats to eat. </p>
<p> Felines can also eat apples, pears and peaches, but in small quantities. </p>

<p> Therefore, you should always boil the fish ... The best way to feed them to your cat is to make a pie made of ground beef or poultry mixed with boiled potato and egg... Isn't this a bit crazy? Has anyone ever seen a cat boiling fish and potatoes for dinner? Cats eat raw prey, period. And they don't usually hunt cows. Unless they are lions or tigers. </p>

<p> Hi Paula, Thank you for your question. In the wild, cats will eat raw prey. However, food prepared for human consumption is often given additives, preservatives and additional ingredients which make them more palatable for their tastes. These can include oils and fats which are not healthy for your cat. Boiling means you don't have to add any fat to cook (as you would with frying)m but it also sterilizes the food from additives which might negatively affect your cat's health. Maybe it seems overly cautious to you, but it's just a way of safeguarding their health. </p>

<p> Cats can't eat food with oil, but in another article (how to prepare homemade food gor cats), in the recipe it says to use olive oil. :/ </p>

<p> Hi Dah, Cats can eat a small amount of olive oil. In fact, it can be good for them, as long as they don't eat too much and have too much vegetable fat which will be counterproductive. </p>

<p> What Human Foods Can Leopard Geckos Eat? </p>
<p> Feeding your leopard gecko human food sounds like a nice idea, right? After all, sharing food is one way to bond with somebody or a pet. Dogs and cats love when we share food with them, even other reptiles like bearded dragons enjoy fruits and veggies. </p>
<p> So, why NOT share something with your leo? </p>
<p> The fact of the matter is that leopard geckos cannot eat any human foods. They are insectivores, meaning they eat nothing but insects and drink nothing but water. The end result is that your leo could end up sick if he eats anything other than appropriate insects. </p>
<p> Read on to discover all you need to know about what leopard geckos can and cannot eat. </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> What Are Common Foods A Person May Want to Feed A Gecko? </p>
<p> Some questions we’ve gotten about what a person could feed their leopard gecko include: </p>
<p> Salads </p>
<p> The answer is no- this is a bad idea. The body of the leopard gecko is NOT capable of digesting such foods. Their body is lacking in what is called a cecum. This part of the body breaks down cellulose, which is part of fruits and vegetables. Their bodies are equipped to only digest insects. </p>
<p> Aside from having no cecum, leopard geckos also have a short digestive tract. This digestive tract is an alkaline tract, while herbivores have longer and acidic, digestive tract which is better equipped to handle such foods. </p>
<p> The skull of the leopard gecko also has an impact on what they are capable of eating. The skull and jaw of the leo has evolved over time to handle the consumption of meat. And it is smaller and less pronounced than that of an herbivore. </p>
<p> What Happens If My Leo Eats Fruit or Veggies? </p>
<p> Some leopard geckos have eaten fruits and veggies because it was sitting there and gave them something for them to do. Other leopard geckos do not react to the food because it doesn’t even move. </p>
<p> There are even some YouTube videos of leopard geckos eating fruits and veggies. However, we do not recommend this, as these foods are simply not digestible by leopard geckos. </p>
<p> Thus, feeding the leopard gecko anything but insects could lead them to feel quite ill and uncomfortable. </p>
<p> What About Fish? </p>
<p> Fish might seem like a natural thing to feed your leopard gecko. However, leopard geckos should not be eating any kind of fish, such as minnows or goldfish. Leopard geckos are denizens of the desert, and in such a place, fish aren’t around anyway. </p>
<p> Furthermore, fish have bones inside, which can lead to impaction or even choke your reptile. Eating raw fish, especially ones sourced from a pet store, can also give your gecko parasites, which could really make him feel uncomfortable and compromise his health. </p>
<p> The bottom line? Leopard geckos should not be eating anything except the gut-loaded insects you give to them. </p>
<p> Now, let’s learn about good insects to feed your gecko and how to feed them properly. </p>
<p> What Can Leopard Geckos Eat Safely? </p>
<p> However, some worms make great treats for your leopard gecko to enjoy once a week or once every two weeks. Waxworms, butterworms, and hornworms are some examples of this. </p>
<p> Feeding the waxworms and butterworms should be done only as a treat because of their high-fat content. Feeding too many of these insects leads your gecko to become overweight or obese, which has negative effects on their health. </p>
<p> In some cases, leopard geckos can become addicted to the taste of butterworms and end up refusing to eat their staple foods as a result. It would be akin to a human eating nothing but pizza- certainly, they would be full, but there would be a serious lack of nutrients. </p>
<p> Make sure that when you do feed your gecko, you are feeding only live food. Many leopard geckos will not touch a worm if it has already died. You should also make sure that fresh water is available in unlimited supply. </p>
<p> A Closer Look: Worms for Your Gecko </p>
<p> Crickets are the old standby for leopard gecko owners because they are tried and true, geckos love them, and they are relatively cheap. They are like rice and chicken for us humans; a staple food that keeps us full. </p>
<p> Let’s learn more about some other worms you can feed your leo on a regular basis. </p>
<p> Mealworms- These are foods geckos just LOVE to eat. They are offered in a variety of sizes depending on the age of your leo, and you can get them in mixed sizes too if you have geckos of varying ages in your home. They are easily found online or in the local pet shop. </p>
<p> Hornworms- These worms are beloved by leos because of their excellent calcium content and good taste. Geckos like these because they are nutritious, but also different from the standard mealworm or cricket. </p>
<p> Now let’s talk a bit more about “special treats” for your leo. </p>
<p> Super worms- These are great for serving once every two weeks. They are quite high in fat and are great for leopard geckos that are picky eaters. </p>
<p> Butterworms- These are very high in fat and good for picky eater geckos. If you have a leo that has to gain weight after illness or being rescued, these are a great way to help them make those gains. These are like candy to leopard geckos, so feed them sparingly, or else your leo might get addicted! </p>
<p> Wax worms- If left to their own devices, leopard geckos would eat these with reckless abandon. These worms taste great to leopard geckos and, if eaten too often, could make the reptile obese. Keep these as a special once a week or once every two weeks treat. </p>
<p> Dusting and Why It Matters </p>
<p> Every time you feed your leo, the insects you feed should be gut loaded and dusted with a reptile calcium multivitamin supplement. </p>
<p> The supplement will provide your gecko with D3, which is needed to form and maintain healthy bones, plus calcium, nutrients, and more, which will keep your leopard gecko in good health. </p>
<p> Using this product, dust the insects every day by placing the bugs in a sandwich bag, adding the supplement, and shaking it up. </p>
<p> To properly gut load, which is required EVERY time you feed, place the insects in an enclosure for 24 hours with pieces of potato, oats, bran, leafy greens or carrots. </p>
<p> After 24 hours, the insects can be fed. If you were curious about how a leo gets their fruits and veggies, it is through the gut-loaded insects they are fed. </p>
<p> Make sure that you closely watch your leopard gecko during feeding. Observe them to see when they are done eating and get rid of any insects that remain. Some insects, like crickets, can bite the leopard gecko, so make sure to get rid of them once the leo is done eating. </p>
<p> Food Size for Your Gecko </p>
<p> Did you know that proper feeding of your gecko depends upon his size? </p>
<p> For babies, offer crickets that are 3/ 8 inch long. </p>
<p> For Juvenile geckos under age 1, offer crickets 1/ 4 inch long. </p>
<p> For Adults, make sure to feed adult size crickets. </p>
<p> It is crucial to make sure meals are sized appropriately. Do not give insects that are wider than the space between the eyes of your gecko. For adults, offer two insects per inch of body length for the gecko. </p>
<p> For example, a gecko measuring in at 4 inches long would get 8 mealworms about four times per week (as you should be feeding every other day for adults). </p>
<p> When to Feed My Leopard Gecko? </p>
<p> When you feed your leopard gecko matters, as it will help keep them on a schedule, help you manage the cost and cleanup of cricket and other insects offered, and of course, prevent them from becoming overweight or obese. </p>
<p> Here is a feeding time list for geckos of varying life conditions. </p>
<p> Leopard geckos that are babies or juveniles (aged under one year) should be given food every single day. </p>
<p> Adult geckos should be given food every other day. </p>
<p> Geckos that are sick should be given food once a day until they get their strength back. </p>
<p> Because leopard geckos are crepuscular animals, you should drop their food into the enclosure later in the day or early evening. This is because leopard geckos start their hunting when living in the wild. </p>
<p> If your gecko is a picky eater, make sure you feed him as you would based on their age, but make sure to place some worms into the habitat so they can eat them later on when they feel ready. </p>
<p> Obesity and Leopard Geckos: Know the Consequences </p>
<p> Feeding a leopard gecko too much can result in obesity for the reptile, which is ultimately uncomfortable and unhealthy for them. </p>
<p> Thus, reptile keepers have a responsibility to provide just enough food to nourish and sustain the gecko, but not overstuff them to the point of becoming unhealthy. </p>
<p> In the wild, leopard geckos reside in places where food can sometimes be quite scarce. As a result, leopard geckos have the natural ability to last in conditions that may not always be conducive to eating every day. </p>
<p> They process and store away their food, which is a natural ability they have as a means of helping them through times of scarcity in the desert. </p>
<p> Leopard geckos store their fat in their tails, which is why they have something of a chubby tail compared to the rest of their body. It is normal- the tail should always be wider than the body of the gecko, and the tummy of the reptile should be flat. </p>
<p> If you feed your leopard gecko too much, regurgitation of the food can happen. The leopard may also become lethargic, legs can become chubby, and they may even develop bubbles near or under the armpit. These are all signs that the leopard gecko is obese. </p>
<p> Toxic Leopard Gecko Foods </p>
<p> Are you curious about what foods could be harmful or toxic to your leopard gecko? In this section, we will cover foods that can be quite harmful to your reptile. </p>
<p> Avoid feeding bugs that light up. Fireflies, or lighting bugs, are two such examples of insects that should NOT be fed to leopard geckos. These bugs are natural possessors of chemicals that are toxic to leopard geckos and should NOT be used. </p>
<p> Insects caught in the wild. It may seem like a great idea to go outside and get some bugs from the backyard. But who knows where those bugs have been, what they’ve landed upon, or if they have parasites? </p>
<p> It’s best to play it safe and stick with insects you purchase from your local reptile shop or online from a reputable seller or pet shop. </p>
<p> Water and Leopard Geckos </p>
<p> Leopard geckos should not be given anything except water when it comes to hydration. Make sure to offer a dish of clean, fresh water at all times of the day in unlimited supply. </p>
<p> Keep the dish shallow in nature, as this will allow your gecko to sip from it easily and comfortably. The gecko will also avoid the risk of drowning if the dish is shallow. Make sure the dish cannot be knocked over, as a means of keeping the substrate nice and dry. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> It may seem like your leo is missing out when he cannot partake in human food like other pets. However, this is not the case. Your leo will be happier, and healthier eating insects and worms served as a special treat. </p>
<p> Enjoy caring for, and providing great nutrition, to your leopard gecko! </p>

<p> Ultimate List of What Huskies Can and Can’t Eat </p>
<p> There are so many different dog food options that it can be overwhelming knowing what is good and bad for their health. </p>
<p> Some people are happy to feed their Husky dog food from a can or package, but what if you want to supplement their diet with ‘human’ food? How do you know what Huskies can and can’t eat? </p>
<p> Like humans, each individual Husky will have their own foods that they can or can’t eat. Some might like a particular food and some might have an allergic reaction to it. </p>
<p> It is up to the owner to make sure that they only give their Husky a small amount when trying each food so that they can make sure it is safe for them. Try introducing a little bit of each food each week so you can see what they enjoy and what you need to avoid. </p>
<p> Below is a list of foods and drinks that you might want to try with your Husky. Just remember that some Huskies might love them, while others might not be too keen. </p>
<p> If your Husky has underlying health issues, or you have any questions at all about whether the following will be good for your Husky, it might be a good idea to double-check with your vet. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Eggs </p>
<p> Huskies can eat eggs. Eggs are a fantastic source of protein and are a great way to add more nutrients to their diet. </p>
<p> But like all foods, it does have its risks. Feeding your Husky raw eggs isn’t necessarily dangerous, but there is a small chance of contracting salmonella and E. Coli, which can cause food poisoning (just like with humans). </p>
<p> On the other hand, cooking the eggs (scrambled or hard-boiled) means that some of the nutrients are altered or destroyed. Your Husky will still enjoy eating the eggs but the health benefits won’t be as great. </p>
<p> It’s up to you to decide how you would like to serve them, but either way is fine in moderation. </p>
<p> Just make sure that if you feed your Husky cooked eggs, they are plain, with no seasoning or sauces on them that could be harmful to your dog. </p>
<p> Another option is to feed your Husky eggshells. These are an excellent source of calcium and can be good for Huskies who have difficulty eating bones. </p>
<p> You can grind up the shells and sprinkle them over their food or serve hard-boiled eggs with the shell still on. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Apples </p>
<p> Huskies can eat apples. The fruit is full of fiber and vitamins, and when cubed or sliced it can be a great treat for your Husky. </p>
<p> Just make sure that you remove the core and seeds from your pieces of apple, as this can be harmful and difficult for your Husky to digest. Apple seeds also contain a small amount of cyanide which can be potentially fatal to all animals (and humans). </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Almonds </p>
<p> Huskies can eat almonds, although it is not recommended. Almonds are not toxic for Huskies, but they are difficult to digest and can cause an upset stomach. </p>
<p> If your Husky does eat a few almonds, it shouldn’t cause any problems, but it’s not recommended to have as a regular part of their diet. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Avocado </p>
<p> Huskies can eat avocado, but it is not recommended. Avocados contain a toxin (in the skin, leaves and seed) called persin, which is poisonous for most animals. </p>
<p> While dogs don’t appear to be affected by persin, there is still a risk involved in feeding your Husky avocados. If they happen to swallow some, don’t worry too much, as avocado is perfectly safe to eat in small doses. </p>
<p> Try to make sure they don’t eat the dangerous parts of the avocado, but if they do and you notice vomiting or diarrhea, consult your vet immediately. </p>
<p> As for guacamole, if it is just plain avocado, that should be fine for your Husky to eat. But avoid it if it also contains garlic or onions, which are harmful foods for dogs. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Drink Almond Milk </p>
<p> Huskies can drink almond milk. Almond milk is made from the processing of almonds, and most Huskies enjoy the nutty flavor. </p>
<p> But it is also a very high-calorie drink, so it should be served in moderation. If your Husky drinks almond milk, you might need to consider increasing their exercise so that they don’t put on too much extra weight. </p>
<p> Make sure that there are also no sweeteners added to the almond milk because some of these could be harmful to your Husky. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Blueberries </p>
<p> Huskies can eat blueberries. Blueberries are full of vitamins and nutrients. Because they are small and soft, they are easily digestible and can be added to their existing food. </p>
<p> Blueberries also make a great treat or healthy snack for your Husky. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Bananas </p>
<p> Huskies can eat bananas. Bananas are a healthy treat that are full of nutrients and fiber, making them ideal to add to your Husky’s diet. When eaten in moderation, they can improve your Husky’s overall health. </p>
<p> You can cut bananas into slices to use as treats during training or add to their food bowl. On hot days, frozen banana slices can be a nice cooling treat. </p>
<p> Make sure that you remove the peel so that your Husky is only eating the fruit. Banana peels are difficult to digest and could give your Husky an upset stomach if swallowed. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Bread </p>
<p> Huskies can eat bread. Plain white or wholegrain bread is usually safe for Huskies to eat. </p>
<p> Because bread contains a lot of carbohydrates, it is important to either limit the amount served, or increase the amount of exercise your Husky gets, to avoid your Husky getting overweight. </p>
<p> You also have to be careful of the ingredients in the bread, and avoid any that contain raisins, garlic, macadamia nuts or anything else that may be toxic to dogs. </p>
<p> While bread is safe for Huskies to eat, raw bread dough definitely isn’t, so be sure to keep your Husky away if you’re baking bread. If your Husky manages to eat some, consult your vet immediately as they could be in danger of alcohol toxicosis. </p>
<p> This is a condition with symptoms that include depressed central nervous system, weakness, hypothermia, and seizures, all of which could prove fatal to your Husky. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Bones </p>
<p> Huskies can eat bones, as long as they are raw or manufactured, and not cooked. </p>
<p> Cooked bones can be dangerous because they are brittle and can splinter or break when chewed on. These shards of bone can then pierce and potentially cause damage to your Husky’s internal organs. </p>
<p> Raw bones or manufactured bones (treats specifically made for dogs) are a good option for many reasons. Not only do they provide nutrients to your Husky, but they help to strengthen and clean their teeth. </p>
<p> They are also good distractions if your Husky gets stressed or anxious and likes to chew on things as a result. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Bacon </p>
<p> Huskies can eat bacon, but it is not recommended. Bacon is high in fat and salt, a combination which is not very healthy. </p>
<p> While there is no harm in giving your Husky a small piece of bacon as a special treat on occasion, it is better to avoid this. </p>
<p> Instead, consider a bacon-flavored dog treat, which is usually a healthier option, and is less likely to cause an upset stomach. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Broccoli </p>
<p> Huskies can eat broccoli. Broccoli is low in fat and calories, which makes it a great healthy treat for your Husky. </p>
<p> While it is OK to feed your Husky raw broccoli, it is usually better to steam it and cut it into bite-size pieces so that it is easier to digest. </p>
<p> Huskies can eat the stalks and florets of broccoli but you should avoid feeding them any of the leaves, which can be harmful to their health. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Beans </p>
<p> Huskies can eat beans, but it depends on what type. Some beans are good for your Husky and contain beneficial nutrients, fiber, and protein. </p>
<p> Green beans, lentils, black beans, chickpeas, and kidney beans are all healthy options, and cooked plain they are a great addition to your Husky’s diet. </p>
<p> Beans you should avoid include refried beans, baked beans, and broad beans. </p>
<p> If rinsed under running water before cooking, canned and frozen beans are also a good option. The rinsing eliminates a majority of the sodium that is usually present in these and makes them safer for your Husky to eat. </p>
<p> But just like in humans, beans can cause gassiness in your Husky, so beware! </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Beef </p>
<p> Huskies can eat beef. Beef is a common ingredient in most dog foods and is an excellent source of protein and nutrients. </p>
<p> If you plan on feeding your Husky lean beef that you have cooked yourself, make sure that it is plain (without salt, sauces or seasoning) because these added extras can cause harm to your Husky. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Brown Rice </p>
<p> Huskies can eat brown rice. Brown rice is an ingredient often found in commercial dog food which is very nutritious for Huskies. It can be served either on its own or with added meat for extra protein. </p>
<p> White rice is also good for Huskies but brown rice is a slightly healthier alternative because it has slightly more protein and slightly less fat than white rice. </p>
<p> Rice is easy for Huskies to digest and can help settle an upset stomach. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Cheese </p>
<p> Huskies can eat cheese, but it is not recommended. </p>
<p> Because of the high fat and lactose, Huskies are likely to get an upset stomach or diarrhea after eating cheese. If your Husky eats a small amount, don’t worry too much, but make sure to keep an eye out for any digestive symptoms. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Tomatoes </p>
<p> Huskies can eat tomatoes, but it is not recommended. Feeding your Husky ripe tomatoes on occasion shouldn’t cause any problems but it is better to avoid doing this. </p>
<p> You also need to be wary of something called tomatine which is found in green tomatoes, as well as the leaves and stalks. This is toxic for dogs and can cause serious health problems if your Husky eats them. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Raw Chicken </p>
<p> Huskies can eat chicken, but it is better for it to be cooked (with no seasoning), rather than raw. </p>
<p> While feeding your Husky raw chicken isn’t necessarily dangerous, there is always an added risk of contracting salmonella, which can cause food poisoning. </p>
<p> It is also best to cut the chicken into smaller pieces, and ensure all bones are removed, to avoid your Husky choking. </p>
<p> As one of the main ingredients in commercial dog food, chicken is full of protein, which can be served on its own or mixed in with other foods to provide a balanced meal for your Husky. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Oranges </p>
<p> Huskies can eat oranges. Full of vitamin C and other nutrients, oranges make a tasty treat for Huskies. Make sure that you remove the peel (which is difficult for Huskies to digest) and feed them segments of the fruit. </p>
<p> Oranges, like all treats, should be given to your Husky in moderation, along with plenty of exercise and a healthy diet. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Grapes </p>
<p> Huskies cannot eat grapes and you should make sure that they never have the opportunity to eat them. </p>
<p> Grapes, along with raisins, are extremely toxic to Huskies and all other dogs, and if eaten, have the potential to cause kidney failure and death. </p>
<p> Even one little grape can cause serious harm to your Husky if eaten, so if you think that your Husky may have eaten one, get them to a vet immediately. </p>
<p> Can Huskies Eat Fish </p>
<p> Huskies can eat fish. While it is probably best to feed your Husky cooked fish (without any type of sauce or seasoning), there is nothing to say that raw fish is dangerous. </p>
<p> While some people may be worried about fish bones causing internal damage or choking, there are just as many people that let their Huskies eat whole fish. </p>
<p> It’s up to you as the owner to decide how you would like to feed fish to your Husky, and if you have any questions, you can always consult with your vet. </p>

<p> What Is a Pescatarian? </p>
<p> Jolinda Hackett has written five books about plant-based cooking and has developed hundreds of vegan and vegetarian recipes. </p>
<p> Pescatarian (sometimes spelled "pescetarian" with an e) is a term sometimes used to describe those who abstain from eating all meat and animal flesh with the exception of fish. A pescatarian, or someone who follows a pescatarian way of eating, maintain a vegetarian diet with the addition of fish and other seafood such as shrimp, clams, crabs, and lobster. </p>
<p> In other words, a pescatarian is a person who eats fish, but doesn't eat steak, chicken, pork or any other kind of meat, only fish and seafood. That's not all they eat. Pescatarians also eat mainly vegetarian foods such as tofu, beans, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and grains. </p>
<p> Reasons to Go Pescatarian </p>
<p> Although the word is not commonly used and a pescatarian is not really a vegetarian, often people adopt this kind of diet for two reasons: one, they have health concerns (such as high cholesterol) and want to cut out meat but still get healthy protein. The other common reason to go adopt a pescatarian diet is to build up to a completely vegetarian diet. With this method, they may eventually phase out fish and seafood but will do so over time. </p>
<p> Other reasons for adopting a pescatarian way of eating include many of the same issues that motivate people to go vegetarian or vegan: a reduced environmental footprint and animal cruelty concerns. And some people follow a pescatarian diet for religious reasons. Pescatarians often believe that moderate consumption of fish or fish oils, which are high in Omega-3 fatty acids, is necessary for optimum health, although vegetarian alternatives, such as flaxseed oil and hemp foods are available. </p>
<p> While it's true that fish is a good source of protein, this shouldn't be the sole reason for eating a pescatarian diet. There are plenty of meat-free and fish-free sources available to vegetarians and even vegans, including eggs, low-fat dairy, beans, lentils, nuts, and more. It's certainly possible to maintain a protein-rich diet without consuming meat or fish. </p>
<p> Are Pescatarians Considered Vegetarian? </p>
<p> No. A pescatarian is not a vegetarian or even a type of vegetarian. There is much confusion over what a vegetarian is and isn't, but no definition of the term ever includes fish or seafood. </p>
<p> A vegetarian diet excludes all animals, and fish are animals. Therefore, a diet that includes fish, or a person who consumes fish cannot be properly called a vegetarian. A pescatarian is not a vegetarian, and a vegetarian diet does not include fish. </p>
<p> What Are Semi-Vegetarians or Flexitarians? </p>
<p> A "semi-vegetarian" -or a "flexitarian" is someone who eats a mostly vegetarian diet, occasionally supplemented by meat, though there's no real agreed-upon definition of how often one can eat meat and still call themselves a semi-vegetarian or a flexitarian. Pescatarians are not restricted to "occasional" fish and may eat fish as little or as frequently as they prefer. </p>
<p> These labels are somewhat personal. If you state that you are a pescatarian, semi-vegetarian, or flexitarian, be prepared to explain your diet choices to those that ask. It's likely that friends, family, and even people you just met will be curious about your dietary habits, restrictions, and reasons. </p>

<p> Food Combining Is The Newest Pinterest-Popular Diet — Does It Work? </p>
<p> From peanut butter and cheese sandwiches to tuna fish and fruit punch, we all have our weird food-combining quirks. But for some people, determining what combination of foods to eat is less about finding an unexpected flavor pairing, and more about strategizing the nutrients they eat together for optimal digestion. </p>
<p> This concept is aptly called "food combining." Although it has roots in Ayurvedic medicine, it's taken off with wellness bloggers who claim these tricks and guidelines can help with bloating, overeating, and even allow you to "detoxify" your body. There are Pinterest-friendly charts that people use to determine which foods you're supposed to eat together or separately, and a bunch of seemingly arbitrary guidelines to follow. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> As with any internet-trendy diet or "eating plan" with restrictive rules this might give you some pause. Here's the lowdown on the diet, according to a registered dietitian: </p>
<p> What is food combining? </p>
<p> Food combining is an eating method that involves consuming certain macronutrients and foods together, and avoiding other mixtures. The goal is to allegedly reduce the work that your gastrointestinal tract has to do to digest your food. By only eating one food group at a time, and waiting a long time between meals, food combiners claim that you can lose weight and help your gut. </p>
<p> To put it simply, "it makes no physiologic sense that there would be harm in mixing macronutrients together," says Ali Webster, PhD, RD, associate director of nutrition communications at the International Food Information Council Foundation. For starters, our gastrointestinal system is built for multitasking, she says. And, most foods aren’t just made of pure "carbohydrate," "fat," or "protein," they’re a combination of macronutrients, vitamins, minerals and other components, she adds. </p>
<p> How do you combine food properly on this diet? </p>
<p> It's kind of confusing, but essentially you're supposed choose one category of food (fruit, starch, animal protein, nuts or seeds) to eat per meal, and then stick to non-starchy vegetables. </p>
<p> “ </p>
<p> Food combinations increase variety, provide a wider swath of nutrient content, and can be more satisfying than eating a single food or macronutrient at a meal. </p>
<p> Ali Webster, PhD, RD, associate director of nutrition communications at the International Food Information Council Foundation </p>
<p> ” </p>
<p> What foods shouldn't be eaten together? </p>
<p> Per this diet, mixing protein and carbohydrates is bad news, because they digest at different rates. Technically, that's true: protein is absorbed slower than carbs, which are the most readily available source of fuel. "This isn’t a bad thing," Dr. Webster says. "Our bodies have evolved systems for managing different types of foods and nutrients and healthy GI tracts are able to handle whatever is thrown into them." Beyond that, foods are classified into either "acid" or "alkaline," and you're meant to stick to one category during a meal. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> "Contrary to what the 'food combining' advocates might think, eating different foods and macronutrients at the same time is actually much more healthful than eating them in isolation," Dr. Webster says. For example, if you ate a high-carb food alone, such as fruit, your blood sugar levels would spike after eating, then rapidly fall, which we know has negative effects on your health. "Eating a meal or snack that includes protein and fiber along with carbohydrates helps to slow glucose absorption, meaning that blood sugar levels won’t spike as high as they would if a person ate carbohydrates alone," she says. </p>
<p> What are the rules around fruit? </p>
<p> The food-combining diet instructs people to avoid fruits that are high in sugar, and stick to ones that are acidic and less-sugary. As we've said before, the naturally-occurring sugar that's found in fruit isn't something to worry about at all. Oh, and you're only allowed to eat one fresh fruit at a time on an empty stomach. While eating an excessive amount of fruit at once could be a lot of fiber for your body to digest at once, nothing is going to happen to your body if you combine fruits. </p>
<p> What's with the food-combining charts? </p>
<p> These cute and easily shareable charts make it easy to see why the food combining diet has taken off on social media. But here's the thing: if a meal plan requires carrying an in-depth chart around to determine what you "can" and "can't" eat, that's a major red flag that it's probably not worth your time. Diets like this one that label foods as "compliant" or "not compliant" tend to create undue stress that can harm your relationship long-term with food. Listening to your body's cues around hunger and satiety is going to be a way more sustainable approach — not to mention a simpler one, too. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> So, should I try food combining? </p>
<p> Unless your doctor has instructed you not to eat certain foods together because of specific health conditions, this diet is not a good idea. The human body is highly skilled at digesting multiple foods or nutrients at once; that's why you remain full and satisfied after eating a meal with a variety of balanced nutrients. (Most of us don't eat individual foods one at a time, either.) "Food combinations increase variety, provide a wider swath of nutrient content, and can be more satisfying than eating a single food or macronutrient at a meal," Dr. Webster says. </p>
<p> If you are really concerned about your GI issues, talk to a gastroenterologist or a registered dietitian before you try some diet you found on the internet, Dr. Webster says. "Prolonged issues with food digestion can signal a food intolerance or gastrointestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome," she says. "So, it’s important to consult a health professional to get to the root of the problem." </p>

<p> 20 Foods You Should Never Eat After a Workout </p>
<p> Why ruin all of your hard work at the gym with bad choices? </p>
<p> We've all been there—you step off the treadmill or power through a particularly tough training session and you feel invincible! Perhaps you even feel like you deserve a prize for all that hard work: An edible one. With extra cheese. We're looking at you, pizza. </p>
<p> But not so fast! You need food post-workout to restore your energy, build muscle, and boost your metabolism, but the wrong kind can undo the hard work you just put in. Meals that are hard to digest, full of sugar, or loaded with saturated fat can do serious damage, right at the moment when your body needs to repair itself most. </p>
<p> With that in mind, we set out to uncover the worst foods to eat after a workout, and we asked the nation's most trusted nutrition experts exactly which foods to avoid. While you're making healthier changes, be sure you try out these 21 Best Healthy Cooking Hacks of All Time. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Smoothies From Pre-Made Mixes </p>
<p> They made be wildly convenient—especially if you are low on time and are whipping something up after an at-home workout—but they usually contain a lot of added sugars. "Your body burns through complex carbs and then fat. Drinking sugary drinks or snacks stops the fat burning process," explains Susan Albers, Psy.D of the Cleveland Clinic. "Make your own smoothies from scratch with a protein base. Drink slowly and mindfully!" Get inspired with the fat-blasting smoothie recipes in the best-selling book, Zero Belly Smoothies! </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Spicy Foods </p>
<p> Spicy foods—anything with salsa, sriracha or hot sauce—are hard to digest, and you'll want to stay away from these choices. "Your body just accomplished a major effort and is a state of repair," says Michelle Neverusky, Fitness Manager of Carillon Miami Beach. "It needs things that are easy to digest, a little protein, a little sugar to bring your sugar levels back to an even keel, and mostly carbohydrates to replenish your energy levels." </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Soda </p>
<p> Maybe you want the caffeine, maybe you want the bubbles, or maybe you just find it refreshing but repeat after us: Never ever drink soda after a workout. "Your body needs to hydrate, and soda won't do that for you," says Stephanie Mansour, a weight-loss and lifestyle coach for women. "Plus, soda may make you bloated!" </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Heavy Proteins Like Steak </p>
<p> Just like spicy foods, Neverusky recommends skipping anything that is hard to digest—like a thick, juicy steak. "If you're bulking up, you want to add a high carb ratio like tuna and rice; but if you are leaning out, you want to avoid carbs and drink a protein shake to retain the muscles." </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Fatty Foods </p>
<p> Skip the oils, seeds, anything fried, and even nuts after your workout. "Fat acts to slow the digestion process in the gut and will, therefore, delay the delivery of much-needed nutrients into the muscles," explains Paul Roller, coach at CrossFit Outbreak. </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> Chocolate </p>
<p> Sigh. Are we really going to tell you that you can't have chocolate after all your hard work? Yep! At least not immediately after. </p>
<p> "Avoid chocolate bars if you're trying to lean down," explains Lola Berry, author of The Happy Cookbook. "Remember that training will have sped up your metabolism; use that to your advantage by keeping your diet super clean with whole foods." But if you really can't kick that craving, Berry says to melt two tablespoons of coconut oil with one teaspoon of raw cacao powder, a pinch of cinnamon, and a smidge of Stevia to make a sugar-free chocolate sauce that you can pour over a bowl of fresh berries! </p>
<p> 7 </p>
<p> Fast Food </p>
<p> Maybe there's a Burger King next to your gym that taunts you and your craving every time you pass by it—but do whatever you can to stay away! "While you may crave salt after working out, fast food options won't be good at replenishing your body," explains Mansour, "You'll be consuming trans fats and basically undoing your workout." </p>
<p> 8 </p>
<p> Simple Carbs </p>
<p> Taylor Gainor and Justin Norris, co-founders of LIT Method sum up eating white bread or pastries in a simple word: "No." Why not? </p>
<p> "All that fat slows down digestion, which will do the exact opposite of what you want to happen after working up a sweat," they explain. "Consuming high amounts of sugars also will work against you if you are trying to lose weight because it slows down your metabolism." </p>
<p> 9 </p>
<p> Energy Bars </p>
<p> Say what? Wouldn't an energy bar make sense, thanks to the fact that they are supposed to give you, well, energy? Not so much. "These might have a lot of protein, which is seemingly great for repairing and building your muscles post-workout," explains Annie Lawless, health/wellness expert and founder of Blawnde.com. "But in reality, most of the bars on the market are mostly sugar and no more nutritionally-sound than a candy bar. And I'm not talking about natural sugar, either; many bars contain refined white sugar and high fructose corn syrup, making them a nightmare for your blood sugar." Get your protein from a whole food source like eggs and pass on the processed packaged bars. </p>
<p> 10 </p>
<p> Sports Drinks </p>
<p> These are classically marketed as the perfect hydration replenishment post-workout because of their electrolytes—so what could be so bad? "The high sugar content in sports drinks make them unnecessary post-workout when your body doesn't need the extra glucose running through your bloodstream," explains Lawless. "If you feel drained and in need of glucose replacement, reach for coconut water or a healthy smoothie. A syrupy sports drink will just cause your blood sugar to spike violently when you don't need it." </p>
<p> 11 </p>
<p> Raw Veggies </p>
<p> Skipping raw veggies after a workout may seem confusing since they usually are a great choice. But it's not the nutritional value that is the problem. "The problem is how filling raw veggies can be when your body needs serious replenishment," says Lawless. "After a tough workout, you need calories, high-quality carbohydrates, and protein. If you fill up on raw veggies that take a lot of volume in the stomach and make you feel full very quickly, you won't be getting the amount nutrients or calories you need post workout." </p>
<p> 12 </p>
<p> High Fiber Foods </p>
<p> "Avoid high fiber foods—especially salads with flax seeds or kale," says Laura Cipullo, RD, CDN, CDE, CEDRD. "They may cause cramping and bloating. Instead, find what works with your body, which may be different on different days." </p>
<p> 13 </p>
<p> Prune Juice </p>
<p> This healthy drink actually serves as a laxative—something you don't need post-workout. "Running and other exercises can already have this effect on your body, so these foods would only exacerbate this undesirable situation," explains Cipullo. Noted! </p>
<p> 14 </p>
<p> Candy </p>
<p> A big no-no after working out is eating anything that will spike your energy and cause a crash. "This means you should be avoiding refined sugars found in candy," say Karena Dawn and Katrina Hodgson of Tone It Up. "Candy lacks important nutrients that give your body the sustained energy you need in order to recover and still get through your day. Instead, it's best to make a protein-packed smoothie post-workout! This will not only keep you satisfied until your next meal, it'll also give you everything you need to repair your muscles and decrease recovery time." </p>
<p> 15 </p>
<p> Black Beans </p>
<p> Stay away from black beans in any form—solo, in soups or stews, or even in burger form. "They have a high fiber count of 15 grams, which slows down the digestive process," says Albers. But worst of all? "It's likely that eating beans post-workout will just make you gassy." No thanks! </p>

<p> Sugary Drinks </p>
<p> Juices—especially fruit punch—should be avoided at all costs because it contains high levels of fructose. "It's slow to digest," says Natasha Forrest, a personal trainer at Crunch gyms. "And it reduces the fat burning effects of a high intensity or fat-burning workout as it adversely promotes fat storage." </p>
<p> 17 </p>
<p> Fried Eggs </p>
<p> Eggs are a wonderful way to get your protein after a workout—as long as you eat them raw or hard-boiled. If you hit a diner or greasy spoon after your workout, don't order your eggs over-easy or sunny-side-up. You're guaranteed to get them drenched in saturated fats—something you want to keep out of your diet right after a big sweat session. </p>
<p> 18 </p>
<p> Booze </p>
<p> Do your friends try to tempt you to go spinning on a Sunday morning with the promise of bottomless mimosas afterward at brunch? "Sorry to be a buzzkill, but booze should never be at the finish line," says FITFUSION trainer Andrea Orbeck. "Drinking after training dehydrates you, reduces protein synthesis, and packs on empty calories. Instead, clink your fork and knife together as you celebrate with a lean chicken breast and side of sweet potato." </p>
<p> 19 </p>
<p> Meal-Replacement or Protein Shakes </p>
<p> "Many meal replacement drinks on the market are filled with junk that will actually hinder your post-workout success," says Orbeck. "Avoid labels with chemical sugars like aspartame, artificial flavors, and colors. If real food can't be an option, go for ones with basic ingredients." The Eat This, Not That! team recently analyzed pounds of different protein powders to determine what's alright and what's on the no-fly list; check back soon for our exclusive list of best and worst protein shakes! </p>

<p> Nothing With a Side of Water </p>
<p> "At all costs, avoid having 'nothing but water,'" explains Neverusky. "Your body wants to recharge. If you don't eat, your body will eat the muscle you just put on during the workout. Be sure to feed your body correctly." Not sure what to chow down on? Get some inspiration from our report, what personal trainers eat after a workout. </p>

<p> What To Eat (& Avoid) After C. Diff. (C. Difficile) </p>
<p> Edit: I have added a post on supplements that helped me in my recovery process, you can check it out here: c. diff recovery supplement guide. </p>
<p> So, I’ve been wanting to put together this post for a while. While, I understand that 99.9% of you who read this blog do not have active c. diff (THANK GOD!), I thought this post could be extremely beneficial and helpful. I wish I could have found information when my family and I had been struggling to figure out how to overcome c. diff, not relapse, and somehow feel human again. Given that 500,000+ people develop c. diff each year, there is a good chance a lot of you guys will unfortunately know someone who acquires c. diff. Since being diagnosed with c. diff last year, I’ve had countless and countless emails from readers who had acquired c. diff. Or people who have stumbled through my site after searching for c. diff help. And this number keeps growing– to the point where I now receive multiple emails from people each week. And the age just keeps getting lower and lower. This is hard for me– it’s scary. We’re at the point now where I’ve seen children who have not been on antibiotics acquire c. diff. THIS IS NOT GOOD. I never, ever want anyone to have to deal with c. diff. But as long as we keep over-prescribing antibiotics and creating superbugs, this problem will unfortunately keep growing and getting harder to treat. Oh and if you didn’t know, a big cause of continuation is not just through human to human, but also through the unsanitary conditions of animal farming. The meat you’re eating could potentially be c. diff filled (40+% of all meat in the US tested positive for c. diff contamination)— gross. Only we can stop this problem from getting worse… </p>
<p> Now, I have to go into this post reminding you guys that I am in no way a doctor. You guys know this. This post is not intended to diagnose or treat your condition. If you have a true medical emergency— especially one like c. diff, then I highly recommend finding a (nutritionally trained) doctor you feel comfortable with, who has your best intentions in mind to help you. What I can offer in this post is advice on what I learned through my process and experience of treating c. diff and the foods I learned would help heal my body– and the foods I knew would exacerbate the problem and cause possible reoccurrence. </p>
<p> During my hospital stay for c. diff. I asked multiple doctors they’re suggestions for diet changes and food tips. The ONLY suggestion offered was that I should consider avoiding dairy because it would be likely that I would now be lactose intolerant. Well, thanks for nothing doc— I was already lactose intolerant to begin with. I was then handed hospital menus with such wonderful options such as hot dogs, burgers and fries, pepperoni pizza, and crystal light. Those things are NOT REAL FOOD. They are processed garbage. They are full of toxins that will further damage your body and not actually heal your body or your newly destroyed gut. Those items are actually things that feed the c. diff and not fight the c. diff. It’s not new news that doctors know little to nothing about nutrition— that doctors receive no actual education on nutrition— with the exception of some who receive (at most) a few hours of classes in their whole academic career. </p>
<p> Luckily, I had spent the last ten or so years really diving into the world of food, cooking, and health. I was constantly curious on what foods could really heal and what couldn’t. And given that I had already had to cleanse my body of candida from antibiotic use some years prior, I already knew that certain foods would feed the c. diff and other foods would starve the c. diff. And I was on a mission to learn more. Some things worked for me and some didn’t. A low fat and/or candida diet or is ideal for anyone who has put their body through antibiotic use– which was a wonderful jumping point for me. Unfortunately for those of us who have suffered or are suffering through c. diff— many of the candida diet recipes wont work given that both those diets include many raw vegetables and nuts that are incredibly hard, if not impossible for someone with a serious case of c. diff to digest. </p>
<p> I knew a good bit, but still needed to learn more. At no point was recovering from c. diff easy. Especially given that there were other problems I was dealing with at the time– but other problems or not, c. diff is hard, really hard. And it whether you like it or not, it can change your diet, for a long, long time, if not forever. Before getting into my recommendations, I want to remind you that c. diff damage varies from person to person depending on prior health, diet, and microbiome problems, age, the strain of c. diff, and the length in which you went undiagnosed and untreated. I went WEEKS with 15+ trips to the bathroom and multiple trips to the ER and doctors office before someone finally tested me for c. diff. It was BAD. The quicker the diagnose, the quicker the recovery time, so please don’t hesitate to demand a stool test if you experience long bouts of diarrhea, especially after an antibiotic. I also want to remind you that everyone is different and what works for some people may not work for others. While some people might do well getting extra protein, some people will find themselves unable to tolerate nuts like they could before. Go forward gently, be kind to yourself, and get to know and trust yourself. If you really listen to your body, you will know what is working for you and what is causing more problems. </p>
<p> So lets start with, </p>
<p> FOODS YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY AVOID WITH C. DIFF & WHY: </p>
<p> sugar and yeast: sugar feeds yeast and bad bacteria. If you have a bacterial or fungal overgrowth of any kind you MUST avoid sugar. This unfortunately means all sugary drinks and even extra sweet fruits (in high amounts and especially in combination with a high fat diet) as well. While something like a mango is packed in vitamins C and really good for you— you must eat fruits carefully, and with a plan to not cause more problems in your gut. I would suggest reading this book to understand the best way to eat fruits for your gut healing. If having fruits, try to have low sugar ones, such as blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, kiwi, or papaya. Otherwise I would only recommend eating fruits on a low-fat diet, as to not spike your blood sugar. Sodas, desserts, anything with added and processed sugar, is very bad for you, especially now. And yes, diet soda too— for a few reasons. But the most simple reason is because it’s toxic. A bit of fruit can be okay on an empty stomach, but do not eat fruits after a big meal. This is terrible food combining for your gut. More reasons to come—> </p>
<p> white starchy foods: for the same reason as above. White rice, white breads, pastas, all those yummy high starch foods will also feed bad bacteria. </p>
<p> gluten and most other grains and legumes: I tried brown rice from time to time in the beginning and learned my body did much better without most grains* In general, you’ll find it’s best to avoid all grains (for a while) after you’ve had c. diff. Grains, while are okay in moderation (if you have no intolerance) before c. diff are not at all suggested in your c. diff recovery time. Gluten and grains can both cause a ‘leaky gut’– or make your leaky gut worse if you already have it. If you have symptoms like brain fog, extreme tiredness, shakiness, irritability, or joint pain then you’ve got to be extra careful to avoid foods that will irritate your gut lining any further. Pay attention to your body and what you feel after eating each item. </p>
<p> raw foods: I mean, you can and should eat raw foods, they’re really good for you and it won’t feed the c. diff– but I added this on here because you might be in for a pretty painful experience depending on the condition of your gut. Raw foods are very hard to digest after the c. diff has just worked its way to destroy as much of your colon as it can— be gentle to your colon, eat soft and cooked foods in the beginning and add raw foods in, as you can. While raw foods are incredibly nutrient dense and good for you, they will be very hard to digest for a bit of time after c. diff. When choosing to eat raw foods, chew your food well, very well– into mush so that your body had a much easier time digesting. You can absolutely try green juices (*without fruits– lemons are okay). This will give you a quick nutrient boost and your body won’t have to digest it like it has to break down a raw leafy salad. If your body approves, then yay! So again, raw foods: GOOD, but proceed with lots of caution and they’re better pureed to not be bent over with digestion pain. </p>
<p> nuts: this is tricky one— you’ll have to listen to your body on this one and see how it reacts. 1. most nuts are high in mold— which will also feeds the fungus in your body. Almonds are typically the only nuts recommended after candida and bacterial infections. 2. nuts are very hard to digest. 3. this won’t apply to everyone, but even if you tolerated nuts in the past, you may find that they don’t agree with your body anymore. I actually developed a mild nut allergy after getting c. diff. I ate a huge assortment of nuts before c. diff, but after my infection I would feel ill and have a terrible sore throat after eating nuts! (*tear*) While it doesn’t happen to everyone, it’s not uncommon for new allergies to develop after c. diff. If you do plan on eating nuts (they are a great source of fat and protein), I’d recommend to have them in butter/pureed form (as is, in smoothies, in sauces) so they are easier on your gut– and only in moderation, as nuts are really high in fat which is terrible for blood sugar levels. </p>
<p> dairy: if you’re lucky a doctor may have warned you to avoid dairy after c. diff. (though he probably didn’t explain why). Pasteurized dairy doesn’t really have any health benefits anyway so you’re going to live a much healthier lifestyle cutting it out anyway. Yes, there’s calcium, but you can find calcium in loads and loads of other food items. But reasons not have it: 1. you probably didn’t know you had issues with it prior to c. diff, but chances are you did. most people don’t realize how lactose intolerant they were until they’ve given it up for a minimum of two weeks. 2. casein (milk protein) and milk sugars are very bad for you and they feed candida/bad bacteria. 3. pasteurized milk doesn’t contain any beneficial bacteria for you gut. 4. any microbes you had left in your gut to digest dairy are now gone. The c. diff has killed them as well as the antibiotics. This is what causes people to be lactose intolerant. Don’t mess around with this— it’s hard, but skip the dairy. </p>
<p> processed foods: this may not seem like an obvious one to avoid, but you should avoid processed foods as much as possible. Besides the sugar, salts, (unhealthy) oils, and whatever flavor enhancers are pumped into the processed foods– you’ve also got a large array of chemicals and preservatives added in there. Chemicals and preservatives shouldn’t be ingested in general, but especially now. Your body is going through a very serious time trying to 1. fight off the c. diff. 2. detox your body of all the bacterial die off and toxins. Your liver is struggling, please don’t make it work harder by having to process extra chemicals! </p>
<p> alcohol: this should be a pretty obvious one, but I figured I should mention it just in case. It’s loaded with sugar and also difficult on your liver. </p>
<p> factory farmed meat: most meat (but not all) is very hard to digest and colon clogging, not cleansing. But even easier to digest meats need to be careful chosen or avoided all together. Factory farmed meats are packed with hormones and antibiotics. You know what kills your healthy gut microbes, but not c. diff? The antibiotics being given to factory animals– which then end up in your body, killing your healthy gut flora. The same way that even one dose of antibiotics can alter your gut flora for a year+, think about the effects of what years of eating antibiotics from meat eating is doing to your gut. Every day you’re harming the beneficial bacteria in your gut— that you NEED! Other reasons to avoid factory farmed meats? They are mostly fed GMO-laden corn and soy— which also does terrible things to your body. The hormones injected in meats are another (very obvious) reason to avoid these meats– all the time, but especially now. You need your body in tip top shape to fight the c. diff and ensure a quicker recovery. And if thats not reason enough, because C. diff is found in over 40% of factory farmed animals and the meat on grocery shelves. Not only that, freezing and standard cooking does not kill the c. diff in your meat. Want to read more? Here are a few articles: one, two, three, four, five. If you’re going to eat meat, make sure it’s pasture raised, grass fed, and hormones and antibiotic free. It’s not worth it to have any other kind of meat. And make sure your fish is wild caught, so that it’s eating its natural diet. </p>
<p> SO WHAT LEFT?! THERE’S STILL SOME GOOD STUFF. </p>
<p> vegetables, lots of them: feel free to fill up on as many veggies are you can. they will be your main source of nutrition (and should be in general). Roast them, sauté them, blanch them, steam them, however you prefer them, just eat them! Pureeing them in soups is an amazing option, as it’ll be easier for you body to absorb all the nutrients in it. All vegetables are wonderful— and the more variety you can include, the better. Dark leafy greens are wonderful, but definitely harder to digest– but adding them to soups (blended) is a great option. While things like cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cabbage are wonderful (especially cabbage because of all its natural probiotics), they do cause a good amount of gas in your intestines, so eat those with care and caution! </p>
<p> fermented foods: I can not emphasis the importance of fermented foods enough! Fermented foods might be the most important food when healing your gut. This is how you will get your good gut flora alive and thriving again. By eating fermented foods you are introducing all sorts of new and beneficial bacteria back into your gut! Try things like: non dairy yogurt, kombucha, kvass, and other probiotic drinks, kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, and miso. Eat a little bit of any of these with every single meal. Even just a tablespoon will help at each meal will help. </p>
<p> protein: if your body will let you have blended nuts, do that. You can also buy nut flours to cook with. Another great option is organic tempeh. Tofu has a lot of debate on whether or not it feeds candida or not. I eat it very sparingly, and only organic tofu to ensure it’s non-GMO. Seeds (blended think seed butters/tahini) are another great source of protein (in moderation as they are high in fat like nuts). I’m not usually one to promote protein powders, as they are highly processed and filled with a lot of junk, but if you protein stores are really low (as mine were), then I would suggest adding some to your diet. Be sure to check the labels! Make sure your protein powder is dairy/whey and grain free. And be sure to stay away from soy protein isolate, as it is incredibly bad for you. And of course make sure it’s sugar free or at least has no added sugars in it. So far I’ve found this brand and variety of protein powder to be one of the better options. I also like to add a scoop of hemp protein powder to my smoothies or breakfast bowls for extra protein. And hemp is rich in omegas too win/win. </p>
<p> healthy fats: in general, having healthy fats in your diet is important. It’s what feeds your brain and keeps you fully functioning. But stick with WHOLE fats, not processed ones. Your body doesn’t need processed oils in it’s system. There hard to digest. And having a lotto fat in your system raises your blood sugar. No one needs high blood sugar in the process of healing. Avocados or coconut are bet. </p>
<p> some grains: as mentioned, it’s better to avoid all grains, but I do know how highly restricting that can be (as if all that^^ isn’t restricting enough)— so if you do plan to include grains into your diet, I would recommend millet, quinoa, or buckwheat. As these don’t feed yeast and bacteria like other grains. Also millet and quinoa are incredibly high in protein! They’re very good for you. Best of all you can have these in many forms— as is, puffed (for cereal), noodles, as a flour for cooking, etc etc. But I do recommend to soak your grains prior to cooking if possible! At least a few hours, but overnight is preferred. This will help break down some of the phytic-acid on the grains for easier digestion. I don’t really recommend eating legumes/beans right away, as they are far too starchy and turn too sugar too quickly, but if you choose to have them in moderation, then make sure you soak these too. </p>
<p> steal cut oatmeal: this one is a bit debatable. Steal cut oatmeal is a prebiotic meaning it feeds your bacteria. But on one hand, this might include yeast and bacteria. But prebiotic foods keep your gut flora healthy and happy, just as healthy foods keep your body nourished and healthy. There have been a few studies done on the benefits of steel cut oats and c. diff and all show to be good. Just be sure you soak your steel cut oats overnight first and cook them well (in new water) for easier digestion. I eat a bit of steel cut oats every single morning since having c. diff. and I find it a really good and nourishing way to start my day. </p>
<p> spices and herbs: spices and herbs are SO good for you! 1. they will increase the deliciousness of your food by 100%. 2. they have so many health benefits! They even fight off and kill a lot of the bad junk in your gut. Load up on things like oregano and garlic (bacteria/microbial killers) coriander, fennel, star anise, peppermint (gut soothers) all the spices and herbs you can in your cooking. Fennel is especially beneficial for easing your gut issues. And turmeric and gingers are superfoods, especially for all the inflammation you’re experiencing. </p>
<p> probiotics and other things: by now, you probably (maybe) know that Sacharomyces Boulardii is super helpful for fighting off c. diff. It is! And if you’re not already taking it, you should! Also, having a probiotic with a lot of different strains is super important with c. diff and after any antibiotic use in general. There are loads of different kinds out there now, and some will be more tolerated than others for each individual. For me, I really liked this probiotic blend after c. diff. I saw a noticeable difference in how I was feeling and my stool too (gross) after a few days of taking it. And it has S. Boulardii in it so you get a bogo with it! I was recommended by a doctor to take glutamine in the beginning of my c. diff experience (for protein/restore gut lining), but after learning that excessive glutamine intake actually feeds cancer tumors, I don’t feel comfortable suggesting it to others anymore. But do your own research and weigh out the risks. On one hand, you need some glutamine in your body (you find this in healthy eating) and it helps heal the gut lining, on the other, excess in glutamine (whether by food intake or in supplements) enhances tumor/cancer growth. If you’re like me, with a tumor sitting there in your body, then maybe avoid. I plan on doing a follow up posts with other supplements I found helpful through my c. diff recovery– but those are the main things to keep in mind for now. </p>
<p> Last Notes: </p>
<p> blood sugar/food combining: as mentioned, you need to be kind to your liver at this time, it’s working hard to detox your c. diff (and candida) toxins. Eating too many fat and too many starchy foods even if its with healthy vegetables) can really spike your blood sugar and make you feel off. Limit fats and have healthy proteins (greens, broccoli, etc) in your meal plan. Adding good amount so healthy greens/protein slows down the absorption rate of the sugar into your body. </p>
<p> think well balanced, always: in general, it’s always a good rule to aim for as well-balanced as possible. With your protein and your veggies, you’ll find it helpful to add a healthy fat for absorption of vitamins, and a bits of greens too. And don’t forget your fermented foods! </p>
<p> salt: a good healthy sea salt or pink Himalayan salt is key! it helps add back in minerals to your body. Raw celery is also a great source of natural salt minerals. </p>
<p> detox: as mentioned a few times, your body is heavily detoxing– and you’re feeling it. New probiotics might make you feel worse, before you get better. This is normal. I wrote an e-book on detoxing a while back– while the recipes may not be useful for someone with c. diff (many raw recipes), you may find much of the detox information helpful. Check it out if you’d like, and pay whatever price you want. As mentioned here, you might spirulina a useful tool during your detox time. </p>
<p> listen: pay attention to your body and how you feel after what you eat. Your gut is now different than it was before, especially if it was antibiotic induced c. diff. If something doesn’t make you feel right, take it out of your diet. Try it again later, if you’d like. Just listen to your body and your gut. </p>
<p> So the reoccurrence rate for c. diff is high, really high, right? (1 in 5). The idea of relapsing into c. diff again gave me anxiety alone. But as long as you’re feeding the good bacteria and detoxing the bad, you should be on your way to recover, without the relapse. It’s hard, I get it. I still have lingering symptoms (from the c. diff, but also from a whole slew of other issues that came about at the same time) and I still have to be quite careful with what I eat, but it gets better. Just remember, these changes are good changes— you’re nourishing your body with healthy and whole foods. It’s a good thing. </p>
<p> If interested, you can see a all posts about c. diff and my food experience here and journal of all my fighting c. diff thoughts here. I know I definitely would have loved to have some help when I got c. diff a year and a few months ago. If you found this to be a useful tool, please share it– especially with anyone who might be struggling with c. diff. Also, this did take time, and while I considered making this an e-book to sell— I know how terrible c. diff can truly be and the information needs to be out there for everyone, but if you’ve found this to be helpful, please consider donating to this site as these articles do take a lot of time to write! Thank you 🙂 </p>
<p> ps. to all your caregivers out there, helping your family and friends out with c. diff, thank you. </p>

<p> Hi everyone, Thank you for sharing all your experiences. I am fighting a 2nd CDiff. Cannot believe it. You are right about ERs. When i drag myself there, after having painful cramps all over my stomack and flushing diarea for 2,5 weeks, the doctor just said that it was a simple food poison . What a waste of money! I knew it wasn’t. So, i insisted on my doctor’s ordering different tests. Finally, stool sample showed CDiff. 2 weeks of Vancomycin. What a torture pill ot is. I was ok for a week, then diarea and cramps came back. More Vancomycin 😎. Thank you, Drea, for your nice writing. I will try to follow this diet. Wish everyone feels better soon. </p>
<p> And I should also say, I am still weak and tired a lot. But like this article says, it’s takes a long time for your body to recover after having it. </p>
<p> I can’t love this post enough! Sounds like you and I had a similar case of CDIFF. Went to the emerg several times. The last I was so lethargic, lost 30 pounds in 4 weeks. No veins in my hands, and could barely stand. They finally took me serious. Tested positive after having it u knowingly for 5 weeks!!!!!!! It was antibiotic induced from treating an elbow infection. Anyhow. Been done metronidazole for 2 months and still struggle with what to eat and get stomach pains daily! Haven’t gained any weight back. Thank you for this post! </p>
<p> I am a two time sufferer of c diff. Mine stem from antibiotic over use from sinus infections. I developed c diff 4 yrs ago got horribly ill and went to ER they filled me full of fluids and sent me home was on flaygl for 10 days and was cured. It was a mild case they said. Well I ended up in ER again recently with this nasty infection again by over use of antibiotics for sinus infection. This time ER dr filled me full of fluids sent me home and I was back in ER within 1 1/2 days and stayed in hospital for 2 1/2 days. I was on flaygl drip, fluid drip and vancomycin liquid by mouth. Now I home taking vancomycin 250 mg 4xs a day till this Friday. Also take florastor and metimucil. I have had the worse nite sweats,, heartburn and total weakness from this newest infection. My stools are formed now, no more smell, and slowly feeling better. Just weak and tired a lot. Going to take time. Hoping I’ll be back to myself by Xmas. I am eating bland diet, soy milk, yogurt, and whatever I can get down. Red meat turns me off right now so just eating chicken, veggies and potatoes. </p>
<p> I’m on my second bout of c diff. This time, as last time, odd stools (blood and mucous and possibly tissue) and headache, slight nausea, chills and sweats, and fever. Stools got runny after 12 hours. Went ER knowing what I had, doc was surprised I was right. Was told “if it isn’t runny, it isn’t c diff” which is not true. Anyway, last time, the antibiotic for c diff made me feel better quickly–what no one told me was the constipation that could follow the diarrhea. So this time, I’m not getting all excited to eat again. Plenty of water. Organic beef broth, baby food of low fiber/gassy vegetables, and organic yogurt with raw honey. Probiotics between doses, and multivitamins. At least I don’t have cramps, bloating, or low energy. Working for me. Also, load up on baby wipes, paper towels, bleach wipes and new toothbrushes. C diff can kill you, don’t let docs push you into antibiotics unless you are already afraid for life or limb. Clean your home like you never have before, bleach or UV light. Some strains of c diff are airborne. Doorknobs, switches, faucets, handles, buttons, remotes, YOUR PHONE, tablet, power cords… bleach wipes from Amazon. “Kills 99.9% of germs” does not cover c diff, it IS the other 0.1%. I went a year and a half between CDI infections. Remember you carry you own c diff, antibiotics let it run wild. I let my doc push me into antibiotic for a small surgical wound infection that could have done just as well with prescription topical antibiotic, which the ER doc gave me. If you think you have it on a Friday, go to the ER get diagnosed and get what is hopefully the last prescription for antibiotics you will ever have. </p>
<p> I am currently on month 3 of fighting c. diff. The doctor has had me on the BRAT diet. After reading your blog, Im going back to plant based. I have never been so sick in my life. </p>
<p> Helpful tip: If you can get your doctor to prescribe vancomycin to be compounded, it will cost anywhere from $150-$350 (depending on the pharmacy, checked several in the DFW area) vs. $750.00. That savings is huge when you have to take multiple rounds. </p>
<p> Thank you so much for this blog! I followed the link above to your preferred probiotic, but the Garden of Life one you linked does not have Sacharomyces Boulardii as you said it would. Is there a different probiotic that should be linked? Thanks so much! </p>
<p> I just contracted c.deficile through 3 different prescriptions of antibiotics. I was having gut issues for a month and a half. Firstly, I have chronic bronchitis so they gave me antibiotics, then it moved into a cold and my bowel movements became worse. I was in and out of the hospital for 2 weeks with all this antibiotics. I was going to the washroom 20X a day,loss of appetite (weight loss), severve stomach pains where I couldn't even function and vomiting. I was first diagnosed with a yeast infection in my gut (candida) and once that went it was an overflow of white blood cells. More antibiotics to fight it, blood and stool tests later, I was diagnosed with c.deficile. I live in Indonesia but I'm Canadian, so there is quite a difference in health care. Let's just say I didn't realize until I was released from the hospital after 4 days how serious it was. Plus there are more protocols back home for isolation and treatment, like wearing gloves and being in your own hospital room. When the doctors saw me, no gloves and in a room with three people, so who knows if they got it. I'm still on meds and was taking flgyl as well. I feel 95% but it's still my bowl movements that are not normal. And like most doctors they are not detailed in what kind of diet. I was told: no spicy, no diary, no processed or fried foods, not too many veggies or fruit, no sugar. This has really woken me up with what I put in my body and how I nourish it. It's been quite difficult socially because I can't drink alcohol but I feel like this has been a blessing. One I thing is that it helps me be more educated in nutrition and how food really helps or hinders your gut. Now I really taste my food and enjoy eating, I also eat more slowly than I used to. I've lost 15lbs in a month with c.deficile but that's only one benefit. It's forced me to wake up. I'm a teacher and in the past when I was in Canada I had an internship with an organization that promotes healthy whole foods and how food helps in all areas of education, nutrition, socialization and a healthy lifestyle. It promoted healthy living for all people by sending food boxes to schools of locally grown organic fruits and veggies, we did workshops in elementary and high schools on healthy eating. It really made me think about how amazing food truly is. The downside was that I never changed my way of eating and I was still eating poorly. Fast forward three years and now I'm wishing I changed at that time. Now I'm really looking into a certificate in nutrition and how I can learn more about food and it's healing benefits along with educating my family and schools. But this will be in a few years because I'm still in Indonesia. Thank you so much for this article, I can now dig even further into what I've been eating and cut out what I don't need. Thank you as well to all the other people that posted, it's helpful to know that I'm not the only one.(edited) </p>
<p> I just contracted c.deficile through 3 different prescriptions of antibiotics. I was having gut issues for a month and a half. Firstly, I have chronic bronchitis so they fave me antibiotics, then it moved inot a cold and my bowel movements became worse. I was in and out of the hospital for 2 weeks with all this antibiotics. I was going to the washroom 20X a day,loss of appetite (weight loss), severve stomach pains wherw I couldn't even function and vomiting. I was first diagnosed with a yeast infection in my gut (candida) and once that went it was an overflow of white blood cells. More antibiotics to fight it, blood and stool tests later, I was diagnosed with c.deficile. I live in Indonesia but I'm Canadian, so there is quite a difference in health care. Let's just say I didn't realize until I was released form the hospital after 4 days how serious it was. Plus the is more protocols back home for isolation and treatment, like wearing gloves and being in your own hospital room. When the doctors saw me, no gloves and in a room with three people, so who knows if they got it. I'm still on meds and was taking flgyl as well. I feel 95% but it's still my bowl movements that are not normal. And like most doctors they are not detailed in what kind of dit. I was told: no spicy, no diary, no processed or fried foods, not too many veggies or fruit, no sugar. This has really woken me up with what I put in my body and how I nourish it. It's been quite difficult socially because I can't drink alcohol but I feel like this has been a blessing. One I think that it helps me be more educated in nutrition and how food really helps or hinders your gut. Now I really taste my food and enjoy eating, I also eat more slowly than I used to. I've lost 15lbs in a month with. Deficiency but that's only one benefit. It's forced me to wake up. I'm a teacher and in the past when I was in Canada I had an internship with an organization that promotes healthy whole foods and how food helps in all areas of education, nutrition, socialization and a healthy lifestyle. It promoted healthy living for all people by sending food boxes to schools of locally grown organic fruits and veggies, we did workshops in elementary and high schools on healthy eating. It really made me think about how amazing food truly is. The downside was that I never changed my way of eating and I was still eating poorly. Fast forward three years and now I'm wishing I changed at that time. Now I'm really looking into a certificate in nutrition and how I can learn more about food and it's healing benefits along with educating my family and schools. But this will be in a few years because I'm still in Indonesia. Thank you so much for this article, I can now dig even further into what I've been eating and look at what I've been eating so far and cut out what I don't need. Thank you as well to all the other people that posted, it's helpful to know that I'm not the only one. </p>
<p> I had c. diff 9 years ago and my stomach has never been the same. I still suffer with chronic digestive issues/pains/symptoms. I eat a fairly clean vegetarian organic non-gmo diet filled with veggies, whole grains, fruits, and beans/legumes/seeds. However, if I even eat one thing that my stomach decides isn't okay, I am sick for weeks. Thank you for this information – I have been to countless doctors who have no idea what to tell me, and often just say "eat a balanced diet". I'm heading to a new specialist next week and am hoping for some answers. Your ideas are much appreciated! I'm going to look into adding probiotics and fermented food into my diet. </p>
<p> My mother has CDiff again and it's been difficult to get good food advice. Love this article! I believe this is going to prove to be a very challenging and difficult transition for her where food is concerned. She was just diagnosed yesterday for the 2nd time and I'm trying to find some guidance to gain control over this sooner rather than later… so… I think the no sugar thing may prove to be one of the more difficult aspects for her. What are your thoughts? If she refuses to put down her sweet and low, are there any OK(like honey) alternatives or just no sweeteners period at this point? Also, your thoughts on teas for her at this early stage? I think I can fix the food aspect but I'm worried about her beverages… she really only drinks sprite all day every day since early diagnosis number 1! She says she doesn't feel like drinking anything else. </p>
<p> well, to give you a bit of insight on my story, my nutritionist said if I didn't have the diet that I had, I would have been dead, for sure. what kept my c. diff from flourishing way too fast was my high probiotic, low sugar diet. processed sugar is a killer in general, bacteria loves to feed and grow on it. I'd stick to a healthy, processed free diet. sugar-free teas are totally okay, imo. </p>
<p> So early this year my amazing friend gave me your book as a housewarming gift. She knew it lined up with how I try to eat and live and she swore by your recipes. Since then I have followed you on Instagram and enjoyed so many of your posts with your daughter as neither of my kids eat meat either. I had no idea you had dealt with c.diff in your journey and I am somehow just know stumbling upon it. My father was admitted to our local ICU with severe sepsis on october 16th. He very soon after contracted c. Diff from the wide array of antibiotics they put him on. Unfortunately, it perforated his bowel and he ended up with a total colectomy. He is still currently in the ICU and on and off tube feeds. But I can't help thinking how awesome the universe is that your experiences were given to me just at the right time. Thank you for such a great post that can help us on our way to healing him once he is out of the hospital. ❤️ </p>
<p> I have been battling with this c diff infection since August 2016. My doctor prescribe 10 days of Cipro and Flagyl because of the flareup of my diverticulitis. 3 to 4 days after I was done with the antibiotics, I started having a fever and diarrhea. I went to see my doctor and my doctor sent me to the ER where I was admitted and put on fluids and Flagyl and Cipro intravenously. CT scan showed that I had severe colitis. Starting having more blood in my diarrhea and jellylike substance also. I was not getting better so they tested me for C diff and it came back positive. They then stop the Cipro and only gave me Flagyl and fluids. I was in the hospital for a total of four days. When I left the hospital they put me on Flagyl for 10 more days. Around 3rd or 4th day after finishing this round of antibiotics, my fever started going up again so my doctor put me back on 14 more days of Flagyl. Once again on the third/ fourth day after finishing this round of Flagyl, I started throwing up and having severe diarrhea and my fever shot up to 101° even after taking four ibuprofen. My doctor prescribed vancomycin, but my insurance needed to pre-authorize it. That would take 24 to 48 hours or cost me $1700…. which my husband was struggling to find a place that even had vancomycin, just to buy two days worth until my insurance would approve it. My daughter, in the meantime, who is an ER nurse came over and assess me, and loaded me up in the car and took me to the ER. I was once again admitted this time for 7 days; severe colitis and yes, positive for C diff. IV fluids, Flagyl and now adding Vancomycin to the mix, along with painkillers and fever reducers and eventually meal replacement fluids, potassium and magnesium. My fever reached in excess of 103°. My doctor, a gastroenterologist and an infectious disease doctor came up with a strategy (war plan), to help me defeat this terrible bacteria. </p>
<p> Yes. Hallelujah! My insurance finally approved the vancomycin, otherwise my prescriptions would've cost me more than $6000. Whew! </p>
<p> 14 days and vancomycin 250 mg 4 times a day. Then 7 days of vancomycin 3 times a day. Then; 7 days of Vancomycin 2 times a day Then; 7 days of Vancomycin 1 time a day. Then 1 vancomycin every other day for 7 days. </p>
<p> They also have me taking probiotics three times a day. I sort of feel like this is a moot point since the vancomycin kills the good bacteria and bad bacteria. I am, however going to do what they tell me to do because I never want to be this sick ever again. (I would have eaten a dog turd if they had told me it would have heal me. ????) I've been out of the hospital for five days and I am following the plan. I'm trying to drink protein smoothies and green smoothies and eat more often because I've lost over 20 pounds in total during this ordeal. No gluten, no dairy. I'm very saddened to think that my body will never be the same and that I may not be able to enjoy some of the foods that I so love to eat. Thank you Drea, for writing this blog and helping me not to feel so alone. It was very educational in what I can and cannot eat, as I was struggling with that. Thank you to all who have commented, also. Best regards to all. </p>
<p> Thank you for posting this and for informing the public about this wicked infection. I don't tell my friends too many details about my illness (unless they ask of course) but I do find it helpful to share articles and posts such as this. Stay healthy! </p>
<p> I have been in same boat . I worked in the hospital and also had surgery in the same hospital that I received c diff . They don't know if it was antibiotics or the surgery but since I worked there I can tell you fifteen people got cdiff within two weeks. One employee died. We shut down the area in the sixth floor for everyone to be away from the rest. Since then I can't tolerate milk or red pepper spices and especially my favorite spice old bay seasoning . Also when stressed out I will have a bout of diarrhea each and every time. I'm trying fluoxetine and buspirol to keep the stress down. Kimchi I've tried but my body didn't like it. Also take probiotics everyday </p>
<p> Here is my problem – I am a super picky eater – sensitive to many textures and don't like many veggies. I have been drinking Kefir daily and taking Florastor and Align – and eating less than ever – but eating – and just being careful not to overeat. Been trying to stay away from sugar – however…it is so hard. I have a HUGE sweet tooth. I need a personal chef to help me! </p>
<p> Hello everyone 🙂 I too have suffered from severe C diff. It all started when I had a laparoscopy hysterectomy, I ended up getting an infection inside where they did the surgery. I was re-admitted for two weeks and pumped full of iv antibiotics. When I was released I was put on an additional 2 weeks of two types of antibiotics orally. I must have contracted c diff when I was back in the hospital. I can't tell you how many times I was using the washroom a day for sure at least 30 times, minimum. I started have bowel movements with blood and mucus and then just straight blood. I was admitted back to hospital and c diff was confirmed through testing. I had to meet with our infectious disease who told me I had been on the Flagyl too long. I was on it for 65 days. He decided to try me on Vancomycin and that put me in to anaphalactic shock. They had to rush me to another ward to give me an epi pen. They put me back on Flagyl and had to make a decision quickly because they were worried about me having "mega colon" which is a condition in c diff patients that can happen if the c diff gets bad enough. The doctor made arrangements for me to have a FMT (Fecal Microbial Transplant). I was sent via ambulance to a different hospital because the city I was in didn't offer this procedure. I have had 3 in total because the first two didn't work. I am finding now after 6 months later I am still lactose intolerant since the infection. I have never been this was prior. This is frustrating and it's great to see a site where people can share their stories and get other advice. Thank you so much for all your ideas and suggestions, I will definitely take a look at some of these alternatives. Hope everyone feels better soon!! xx </p>
<p> I am so conflicted with information allover the internet! I am on my 2nd round of antibiotics and if this doesn't work they will put me on another MONTH straight of antibiotics (pulsing method) and if that doesn't work a fecal transplant :/ I was doing kefir, kombucha, cut out booze, and eating pretty clean: wild salmon, brown rice, steamed brocc, oatmeal, bananas, green juices, orgegno oil and s boulaardi along with the flagly. but still feeling weird spasms in colon and pinching pains. My doctor said low fiber diet, I said what? White rice, plain pasta and toast? Canned vegetables and fruits? How can this be ok!? Then I read allover stay away from lentils beans and nuts and fiber becuase it tears up your raw gut with the fibers. And stay away from cabbage so how can I eat fermented sauerkrat? Any advice from anyone would be so appreciated! </p>
<p> Drea, thank you for all of the work you put into this post! Sadly, you are right about medical professionals not knowing a whole lot about healing diets. I am currently in nursing school (almost done!!), and I have only had to take one basic nutrition class! I have had a few patients in my clinical rotations who had C. diff, but nutrition was never mentioned in how to care for these patients. I am really drawn to natural healing practices, but these are often overlooked in medical education and practice today. I'm grateful for people like you who promote natural healing (rather than rushing to the pharmacy at the first sign of sickness). Thanks for the post! It was very informative, and I will definitely refer to this for use in my nursing practice. Keep doing what you do! </p>
<p> I really appreciate your thorough work on posting this. I didn't have C Diff but was on major antibiotics within a 4 year period. I was hospitalized for an infection that spread… ended up with a hysterectomy and appendectomy and an epic amount of antibiotics to kill infection. The second blow came when a student gave me TB – I was on a 6 months INH treatment to kill the latent form of TB. These two epic treatments changed my life (way of eating), lots of pain, symptoms, doctor visits, chemical sensitivities!!! Dysgeusia… it's been awful. Like you, I have good days and bad days. The better I eat (veg. /no grains) the better I feel. Thank you for all that you share, Drea. </p>
<p> Thank you for this Drea! You are such an inspiration and I have started implementing so many of your tips into my family's diets. </p>
<p> Any update on the lump in your brain? I sincerely hope it is nothing and hope you are doing well. Sending lots of love, positivity, and colorful light your way! </p>
<p> (continued) But…now I've had antibiotics several times. The second time was a really persistent throat infection that I knew, after fighting it for a few weeks with various sick days, couldn't just be a virus. So I went to the doctor and was given antibiotics. And they did clear it up. But that happened last year and if I had to pinpoint a time I noticed more unpleasant poos…it would be last year. </p>
<p> I never had these issues before coming to England. And I realised that the past few weeks of no normal bowel movements and weight loss noticeable enough that other people are telling me I've lost weight: it has to be because I was put on antibiotics again. I have had a keratin cyst on my buttcheek for like five years that never really was an issue besides that I hate it and it's ugly. But I noticed it slowly get a head on it like a zit, and then the entire thing turned bright red and got painful. So I thought, "I'll go to the doctor, I can finally get it taken care of!!" The doctor of course prescribed antibiotics which I was hesitant about, but what are you gonna do? She tried excising it with no luck, so I finished my course of antibiotics. A few days later, the cyst actually became poppable on its own. </p>
<p> I'm glad it's gone, but I really now believe it took my gut flora with it. I don't think I'm as severe as cdiff, but I had to cave and buy some dairy yogurt drink with cultures because I am desperate for some relief. I don't need to lose weight and I'm sick of these types of bowel movements and digestion being "normal." It's difficult because I think antibiotics were pretty much appropriate in every scenario here, but they've still completely ruined my natural flora and now I'm playing that difficult game of trying to find out what works for me when doctors don't even really recognise this as a problem. I kind of suspect I have small intestine bacterial overgrowth based on how badly I bloat after eating sometimes. I am eating quinoa and sweet potato for the fiber, good carbs, and protein. Also, I think the dairy yogurt cultures drink is helping (lactobacillus I think, the Actimel brand) because I finally had normal, solid bowel movements yesterday. Now I'm just praying they weren't a fluke. </p>
<p> I already loved your blog but the fact that you know about antibiotic and gut issues is such a relief when it turned out I was gonna have the same problem. Thanks so much for this guide. </p>
<p> I've been struggling with digestive issues that have worsened in the last year, but particularly the last two months. I had a blood test in December to see why I had so much fatigue and brain fog and just thought I'd have them check for gluten sensitivity while I was there because I was having crazy bloat issues and really unpleasant bowel movements most of the time (unless I was constipated for a few days which did happen pretty regularly). I'm sure many with sensitivities know the kind: not very solid, very foul in odor, usually pretty urgent and sudden. </p>
<p> My blood test showed that my antitransglutaminase antibodies were 14 on a scale of 0-14 so the doctor sent it up for more rigorous testing. But I left that checkup under the impression that I pretty much had celiac disease. </p>
<p> Fast forward two weeks, and the further results showed that I was "completely normal." I was beyond frustrated because I couldn't get rid of the fatigue and was sick of going through those bowel movements. Like…how could that be completely normal? </p>
<p> I've also noticed these past few weeks that I've been on a steady decline of losing weight. Yeah my nutrient levels weren't deficient in my blood test, but why was I eating how I was and losing weight? I should at least be maintaining my weight. I'm a vegetarian anyways who ends up eating vegan a lot of days and I have done so for three years so I kind of always pinned it to the fact that I stopped eating meat and dairy. But that doesn't explain why I'm suddenly always weighing less when I step on the scale. </p>
<p> Cue: antibiotic use. </p>
<p> I'm studying abroad in England. England has the NHS. Before I came here, I didn't really go to the doctor that often and I didn't really need to anyways. Had a standard diet, was healthy, whatever. Well, I started dating a guy over here when I got here three years ago and I forgot that you're supposed to pee after sex. I got a really persistent UTI that I tried fighting off for two months before I finally caved and went to the doctor (which I was actually relieved I could do as it's free even for a foreign student; universal healthcare is a great thing). I was given antibiotics which cleared up my problem. I was so relieved. </p>
<p> That was the first time I ever had antibiotics. I felt back to normal after they cleared my UTI up. (continued) </p>
<p> You should give lectures about this in hospitals!! New business idea on a plate 😉 </p>
<p> Loved reading this. I just got into NCNM (National College of Natural Medicine) here in Portland for Nutrition, and a big goal of my is to try and jump start some sort of holistic nutrition program into hospitals. It's so needed! </p>

<p> What to Eat After Dental Implant Surgery </p>
<p> Diet Tips From Dr. Grubb </p>
<p> Once they’re fully healed and integrated with your jawbone, dental implants give you the chewing strength to enjoy all your favorite foods. However, it’s crucial to avoid certain foods for the first few weeks after they’re placed if you want your treatment to succeed. </p>
<p> Explore our guide to learn some helpful tips for your post-surgery diet. </p>
<p> Foods to Avoid </p>
<p> To prevent damaging your implant and setting your treatment back, avoid the following foods for at least a week after implant surgery: </p>
<p> Sticky foods, such as caramel and taffy </p>
<p> Chewy foods, such as gummies and bagels </p>
<p> Very hot foods and liquids, such as coffee and soup </p>
<p> What to Eat the Day After Implant Surgery </p>
<p> After your implant is placed, your teeth and jaw will be in a very delicate state. That’s why it’s crucial to stick to a soft-food diet for the first 24 hours after surgery. To help you plan your meals, Dr. Grubb recommends incorporating the following foods: </p>
<p> Smoothies — Smoothies are filling, nutritious, and easy to pack with essential vitamins for restored energy. Best of all, smoothies don’t require any chewing, making them an ideal meal option after surgery. </p>
<p> Applesauce — You won’t be able to bite into an apple at this point in your treatment, but applesauce can provide many of the same nutrients without harming your implant. </p>
<p> Cold soups — Though it’s essential to avoid hot foods and liquids, you can enjoy cold soups such as gazpacho and more. </p>
<p> When you’re drinking liquids, it’s extremely important to avoid using a straw. The suction force puts pressure on your implant and can interfere with the healing process. You should also refrain from drinking alcohol or smoking for at least a few days. </p>
<p> What to Eat in the Weeks After Implant Surgery </p>
<p> As your jaw continues to heal, you can slowly reintroduce solid foods into your diet. Dr. Grubb recommends choosing meals that are rich in protein and other essential nutrients to speed up your recovery. </p>
<p> Some of the foods he recommends are: </p>
<p> Eggs/Omelets — Eggs are easy to chew and filled with protein. Mix them with vegetables and make an omelet for a well-balanced meal </p>
<p> Potatoes — One of the toughest parts of sticking to a soft-food diet is the lack of variety. Potatoes are a very versatile food that can be prepared in several different ways without losing their soft texture. </p>
<p> Chicken, Fish, and Ground Beef — If you eat meat, Dr. Grubb recommends slowly introducing it back into your diet. Start with softer meats like chicken, fish, and ground beef that can be finely chopped into salads, pastas, and more for a delicious meal. </p>
<p> Milk/Cheese/Yogurt — Dairy products are loaded with protein and calcium that aid the healing process and help to keep your teeth strong. </p>

<p> Frequently Asked Questions </p>
<p> Why is it so important to focus on protein intake after dental implant surgery? </p>
<p> Protein is essential during the healing process. Not only is protein necessary to build and repair tissues affected by dental implant surgery, but it also helps the body fight infection. As you recover from dental implant surgery, Dr. Grubb recommends that you eat more protein than you might normally consume so that you can boost your body’s healing abilities. </p>
<p> How do I add protein to a soft-food diet? </p>
<p> When most people think of protein-rich foods, they think of meat and nuts first. Obviously, neither of these foods will be very appealing to someone who has just undergone dental implant surgery! However, there are some easy steps you can take to keep your protein intake high while you focus on soft foods: </p>
<p> Try adding protein powder, avocado, or peanut butter to smoothies Enjoy some protein-packed eggs or beans Load up on soft dairy products like yogurt that are rich and protein </p>
<p> In the weeks following your dental implant surgery, you’ll also be able to incorporate meat back into your diet—just be sure to start with softer meats like ground beef, chicken, or fish. </p>
<p> What if I don’t have an appetite after dental implant surgery? </p>
<p> It’s normal for patients who have recently undergone oral surgery to not have much of an appetite. You might also be nervous to eat because you’re concerned that it will be painful or damaging to your mouth. We absolutely understand this, but Dr. Grubb can’t stress enough how important it is that you give your body the fuel it needs to heal while you recover. </p>
<p> Following your dental implant surgery, Dr. Grubb will make sure that your mouth is able to tolerate food, so you don’t need to worry about causing damage to the treated area by eating as long as you adhere to a soft-food diet. You will be given medication to ease your discomfort, and many of our patients actually find soft, cold foods feel good on their delicate gums. </p>
<p> That first day after surgery, you might find that milkshakes (no straw!), ice cream, and yogurt are especially soothing. Focus on soft foods that you love, and add protein wherever you can. Gradually, your appetite should come back and you’ll be able to eat a wider variety of foods. </p>

<doc id="file21599484" filename="what-to-eat-after-food-poisoning" parent_folder="web2" url="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/what-to-eat-after-food-poisoning">
<p> What to Eat After Food Poisoning </p>
<p> We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process. </p>
<p> Food poisoning typically occurs when pathogens contaminate food or drinking water. Though uncomfortable, food poisoning is relatively common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 6 Americans will get some type of food poisoning this year. </p>
<p> Let your stomach settle. After you experience the most explosive symptoms of food poisoning, like vomiting, diarrhea, and upset stomach, experts recommend letting your stomach rest. That means avoiding food and drink altogether for a few hours. </p>
<p> Stay hydrated </p>
<p> Liquid intake is crucial for helping your body fight off food poisoning effects. Vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration, so sucking on ice chips or taking small sips of water is a good starting point. </p>
<p> Sports drinks that contain electrolytes are the best way to prevent dehydration during this time. Other suggested liquids include: </p>
<p> non-caffeinated sodas, such as Sprite, 7UP, or ginger ale </p>
<p> decaffeinated tea </p>
<p> chicken or vegetable broth </p>
<p> Eat bland food </p>
<p> When you feel you might be able to hold down food, eat foods that are gentle on your stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Stick to bland, low fat, low fiber foods. Fat is harder for your stomach to digest, especially when it’s upset. Avoid fatty foods to prevent upsetting it further. </p>
<p> The BRAT diet is a good guide to follow when you have food poisoning. </p>
<p> Try natural remedies </p>
<p> During an episode of food poisoning, it’s important for your body to follow its natural reaction to cleanse and purge the digestive tract to get rid of the harmful bacteria. That’s why an over-the-counter (OTC) diarrhea medication isn’t a good way to treat food poisoning. </p>
<p> While your symptoms are at their peak, you might want to try drinking ginger tea, as ginger is known to soothe the stomach. </p>
<p> After you’re feeling well again, you may wish to replace your normal intestinal flora with natural yogurts or probiotic capsules for at least 2 weeks. </p>
<p> This will help your body regenerate the healthy bacteria lost in the food poisoning purge and get your digestive system and immune system back on track. </p>
<p> Other tips </p>
<p> Delay brushing your teeth for at least an hour. Stomach acid expelled during vomiting can damage the enamel on your teeth, and brushing your teeth right after you vomit can further erode the enamel. Instead, rinse your mouth with a mix of water and baking soda. </p>
<p> Showering helps cleanse your body of the unhealthy bacteria. You should also be sure to get plenty of rest. Getting sufficient rest can help make you feel better faster. </p>
<p> Your body is already on the offensive, shooing away the pathogens responsible for food poisoning. You don’t want to give the invaders any more ammunition. </p>
<p> Your No. 1 priority should be to avoid the foods that caused you to get sick in the first place. Throw the suspected culprit into the garbage immediately, and keep it shut so the contaminated food is out of your pets’ reach. </p>
<p> Avoid foods, drinks, and substances that are tough on the stomach, such as: </p>
<p> Five pathogens are responsible for most foodborne illnesses in the United States. These pathogens include: </p>
<p> norovirus, commonly found in oysters, fruits, and vegetables </p>
<p> Salmonella, commonly found in eggs, meat, and dairy products </p>
<p> Clostridium perfringens, found in meat and poultry </p>
<p> Campylobacter, found in undercooked meat and contaminated water </p>
<p> Staphylococcus, found in animal products such as cream, eggs, and milk </p>
<p> Salmonella and norovirus are responsible for most hospitalizations for food poisoning. But hospitalizations for food poisoning can also be caused by the following: </p>
<p> Undercooked meat and improperly handled produce are common culprits in food poisoning. Wash your hands, utensils, and plates between raw and cooked stages. </p>
<p> Most people who experience food poisoning don’t require a trip to the hospital, but you won’t want to venture too far from the bathroom either. </p>
<p> Upset stomach, vomiting, and diarrhea are the most common symptoms. They typically subside after 48 hours. If you have a history of dehydration, heart disease, embolism, or other serious health problems, seek help and drink plenty of fluids. </p>
<p> Call the Poison Help Line at 800-222-1222 if you experience severe symptoms. They track cases to help prevent outbreaks and can help determine if you should go to the hospital. </p>
<p> Severe symptoms of food poisoning include blood in your stool, severe abdominal cramping, blurry vision, and diarrhea lasting more than 3 days. These are all indications to seek medical care. </p>
<p> Read on to find out the right things to eat to recover quickly, and how else to know if you need to see a doctor. </p>
<p> Infants and children </p>
<p> Food poisoning is as common in children as it is in adults, and it can be cause for concern. Children, especially those under 1 year of age, are susceptible to botulism. Botulism is rare, but it can lead to paralysis and even death if not caught early. </p>
<p> Children are also in greater danger of having serious reactions to the E. coli bacteria. </p>
<p> Any infant or child that appears to have symptoms of food poisoning needs to be seen by a medical professional to rule out botulism and dehydration. Children become dehydrated more easily than adults and need to be monitored closely. </p>
<p> Pregnant women </p>
<p> Pregnant women should treat any case of food poisoning with caution. Listeria food poisoning has been shown to hurt the development of unborn babies. </p>
<p> Proper nutrition in pregnant women is essential to helping their babies develop. For this reason, any signs of food poisoning should be brought to the attention of a medical professional. </p>
<p> Older adults </p>
<p> Older adults are also more susceptible to complications from food poisoning. In particular, certain strains of E. coli can lead to hemorrhaging and kidney failure. If an adult over 60 has symptoms of food poisoning, they should contact their primary care physician for advice. </p>
<p> People with chronic conditions </p>
<p> People who have chronic illnesses such as HIV, liver disease, or diabetes are at a greater risk of experiencing more serious complications of food poisoning. Those receiving treatments that suppress the immune response, such as chemotherapy, are also at greater risk. </p>
<p> The symptoms of food poisoning don’t typically last more than 48 hours. If 2 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared, it’s time to call a medical professional. </p>
<p> Remember that severe symptoms, such as bloody stool, dizziness, muscle weakness, and severe stomach cramping should be taken seriously. Don’t wait for those symptoms to subside before seeing a doctor. </p>

<p> What to Eat (and Not Eat) After You Get Food Poisoning </p>
<p> A nasty case of food poisoning is usually followed by two things: swearing off everything you ate in the past 24 hours, and then worrying about putting anything else in your mouth (for fear it'll quickly come back out again). </p>
<p> The road to recovery isn’t paved with starvation, though, so we asked Margarita Rohr, MD, an internist at NYU Langone Medical Center, about what you should be consuming -- and what might be a gamble. </p>
<p> Disclaimer: Obviously, if you've got food poisoning, your first step shouldn't be to ask "what can I eat?" -- seek medical help, then worry about whether you can still consume mac & cheese. </p>
<p> The BRAT diet </p>
<p> After food poisoning, you need nutrients, so the key is to find foods that will nourish you, while keeping your stomach from freaking out. According to Dr. Rohr, that means eating the BRAT diet. “BRAT” is a mnemonic device to help you remember what foods you can stomach. Spoiler: the regimen is also known as the “bland diet.” </p>
<p> The disclaimer here is that not all doctors agree, says Dr. Rohr: "There isn't a lot of scientific evidence to back up this method (some doctors suggest resuming a normal diet immediately afterwards), but it is still often recommended." It's one strategy you can try to see how it goes for you, and the whole point of following this advice is to get you back on your A-game, eating the delicious foods you actually like without fear. </p>
<p> B is for Bananas </p>
<p> "The most important thing to do during and after food poisoning is to maintain hydration and replace electrolytes," says Dr. Rohr. Electrolytes are the magic ingredients in the Gatorade you're chugging in hopes of curing a hangover. Potassium and sodium are the main ones your body needs, and they work together to help your body retain water for optimal hydration. Dr. Rohr specifically recommends bananas, saltines, and some broth -- potassium, sodium, and water, all in one sub-par (but therapeutic) meal. </p>
<p> R is for Rice </p>
<p> You know how we always tell you to choose whole grains, and how you keep feeling a tinge of guilt when you get normal, delicious white rice with your Thai curry while your friend across the table asks for brown? (The brown rice costs a dollar more, so that's an excuse, right?!) Food poisoning is your free pass to forget about the brown rice! It's pretty high in fiber, which is usually super healthy, but harder for your stomach to digest, so it's white rice all the way. Dr. Rohr says that you can also substitute pasta here, provided it's sauceless. Sorry. </p>
<p> A is for Applesauce </p>
<p> If you can't do an apple a day, maybe a cup of applesauce can keep the doctor from having to come back? Same story with the fiber here -- applesauce contains less fiber than whole apples, which usually makes apples a better choice, but not when you're dealing with an upset stomach. Basically, feed yourself like a baby. With applesauce, you're getting something that's good for you in the easiest-to-digest way possible. Plus, applesauce contains pectin, and that can help with diarrhea (which you're no doubt intimately familiar with at this point). </p>
<p> T is for Toast </p>
<p> White toast, as well as saltines, as Dr. Rohr suggests, are among the simplest foods for your stomach to handle. If you've come down with food poisoning because you were being adventurous with the food experiences while traveling, what you can eat "all depends on location, how remote your destination is, and what kind of food is available," says Dr. Rohr. "In most countries, you will have access to carbs." </p>
<p> Take a probiotic </p>
<p> If you end up taking antibiotics for whatever you have, not only do they (hopefully) kill the bug, but they also wipe out the good bacteria residing in your body. Dr. Rohr also recommends taking a probiotic supplement to get the healthy bacteria to repopulate your digestive tract, which will help get your stomach back to normal function. </p>
<p> Avoid: spicy food </p>
<p> You may assume that the tears that come to your eyes and the burning sensation through your sinuses upon ingesting some strong curry or wasabi must be good thing -- delicious foods are bad for you and painful foods are healthy, right? Not really: while spicy foods may help to clear your sinuses, there's a time and place for everything, and this isn't it. In the case of food poisoning, spicy foods can irritate your stomach, which is the last thing you want. Hold the Tabasco. </p>
<p> Avoid: fried food and heavy sauces </p>
<p> Dr. Rohr tells us that "foods that are heavier are not as easily digested and may temporarily worsen symptoms." Noooo! Not worsened symptoms! You have a free pass for the white bread, but not for the French fries. Take what you can get. </p>
<p> Avoid: dairy </p>
<p> Even if you're one of the lucky lactose-tolerant folks who enjoys the lattes and the ice cream, dairy is still not your stomach's favorite substance to encounter coming down the esophagus. "Some bacteria and viruses distort, shorten, and damage the villi that line the intestine," Dr. Rohr told us. (The villi are those little finger-like things that can look like something else if you're thinking in the wrong direction.) "They help with digestion, so after food poising it may be more difficult to digest some food, and especially dairy." </p>
<p> Avoid: what made you sick in the first place </p>
<p> "I always recommend drinking bottled water and avoiding raw meats and fish," Dr. Rohr advises. Trying to rehydrate with water from who-knows-where and attempting to enjoy ceviche from a street cart in Peru are just not going to be safe bets at this point, though. "In general," says Dr. Rohr, "I offer the following advice to travelers: wash hands before eating, use hand sanitizer if you don't have access to a sink. Avoid unpasteurized fruit juices and unpasteurized milk and milk products. Eat food that is fully cooked and served hot, and avoid tap water and ice." If you don't follow these tips, just know that you'll likely have to start reading from the top in no time. </p>

<p> What to Eat Before and After Your COVID-19 Vaccine </p>
<p> Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, LDN, CLEC, CPT, has studied nutrition for almost two decades. She was named an emerging leader in women's health by the National Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. </p>
<p> Nick Blackmer is a fact checker and researcher with extensive background in health content. </p>
<p> Now that every person in the U.S. 16 and over is eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, you may be gearing up for your first or second appointment. You've likely heard of the vaccines' potential side effects, especially after the second shot of a two-dose regimen. </p>
<p> Even though there are no sure-fire ways to prevent feeling tired or nauseated post-injection, there are some dietary tips you can follow that may help you feel a bit better during the process. </p>
<p> Here are five steps you can take before and after your vaccine appointment to help prepare your body and keep you feeling your best. </p>
<p> Do Not Get Your Vaccine on an Empty Stomach </p>
<p> Having something nutritious in your system pre-injection can help the entire process feel a bit more bearable. While eating before your appointment does not appear to have any effect on the vaccine’s effectiveness, it could help prevent you from fainting or feeling dizzy—especially if you don’t typically do well with needles. </p>
<p> Considering people are required to wait at least 10 to 15 minutes post-vaccine to monitor for any potential allergic reactions to the injection, eating something beforehand can help you feel your best during the entire process. Most facilities won't allow you to eat snacks in the waiting area. </p>
<p> Choose food combinations that include unrefined carbohydrates, healthy fats, and protein to give your meal some staying power. Something as little as a piece of fruit with nut butter can be a perfect pick-me-up before your appointment. </p>
<p> Stay Hydrated </p>
<p> Headaches are a common side-effect of the vaccine, and being dehydrated can exacerbate that pain. </p>
<p> Stay ahead of the sour feeling by drinking lots of fluids. Stick with water, 100% fruit juice, teas, or other options that aren’t too sugary. Keeping a water bottle by your side throughout the day can help stay on top of your hydration the day of your appointment. </p>
<p> Skip the Alcohol </p>
<p> Drinking alcohol before you get the vaccine is not advised. And although having a cocktail or two after your shot does not appear to make your shot less effective, overdoing it can make you feel physically worse. </p>
<p> Compound that with the side effects many experience after getting vaccinated—lethargy, headache—and it makes the perfect recipe for not feeling great. It might also make it difficult to distinguish what is a side effect of the vaccine from what is a side effect of too much alcohol. </p>
<p> Plus, alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, which you should try to steer clear from when trying to support your overall health and immune system. </p>
<p> Focus on Anti-Inflammatory Foods </p>
<p> After you get your vaccine, you want to support your immune system. Focusing on anti-inflammatory foods that are not heavily processed or refined may help your body stay healthy. </p>
<p> In a 2020 article published in the British Journal of Nutrition, results show that eating an anti-inflammatory diet can help reduce the risk of COVID-19.﻿﻿ And since the ultimate goal is to keep your body COVID-free, continuing to follow an anti-inflammatory diet will serve you well. </p>
<p> Focus on healthy fats and less-processed foods to reap the most benefits from your diet. Avocados, salmon, nuts, and vegetables are all great choices with anti-inflammatory effects. </p>
<p> Keep Anti-Nausea Items on Hand </p>
<p> While some people will feel just fine after receiving their vaccine, some may feel nauseated afterward. Keeping items that may help combat nausea on hand can be helpful in case it kicks in. </p>

<p> What to Eat and What to Avoid After a Tooth Extraction </p>
<p> Before you have a tooth extracted at a dentist office in Marietta, GA, it’s important to fully discuss the tooth extraction procedure with your oral surgeon. The dentist office will provide you with in-depth aftercare instructions for your tooth extraction recovery . Follow these instructions carefully and contact the dentist office if you have any questions or if you experience any possible complications. </p>
<p> How to Eat </p>
<p> Your approach to eating is just as important as the types of foods you eat. It’s advisable to only chew on the opposite side of your mouth from the treated area. Since you’ll likely be consuming more liquids than solids initially, it may be tempting to use a drinking straw. In fact, this isn’t advisable because the suction of the straw can dislodge the blood clot and lengthen your total healing time. </p>
<p> What to Eat After Tooth Extraction </p>
<p> For at least 24 hours after your tooth extraction, you should consume only soft foods and liquids. You can ease into a more normal diet when you feel comfortable doing so. Try to stick with easy-to-chew foods for a few days. Initially, choose cool foods like yogurt, pudding, Jell-O, and ice cream. If you choose ice cream, select a variety that does not contain crunchy or chewy candy pieces and avoid ice cream cones. Applesauce is a good choice after your tooth extraction because it will add some fiber to your diet. After the first day, you might try mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, and broth-based soups without large chunks of meat. Eat these foods lukewarm, not hot. </p>
<p> What Not to Eat </p>
<p> Generally, tooth extraction patients are advised not to consume alcoholic beverages for at least 24 hours following the oral surgery. If you are taking powerful pain medications, avoid consuming alcohol until you’re no longer on the medicines. For about a week, it’s best to avoid eating hard, crunchy, chewy, or brittle foods like chips, nuts, and popcorn. You might also find it difficult to properly chew tough cuts of meat. Instead, try getting your protein from dairy products. </p>

<p> What Should You Eat Before and After the COVID Vaccine? Here’s What a Nutritionist Says </p>
<p> In a couple of weeks, every American adult will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. If you haven't had yours yet, you may be wondering how to prepare, including what to eat or drink before or after your vaccination—and what to avoid. </p>
<p> It's important to know that all three COVID vaccines were tested on people who ate their usual diets. That means the vaccines have been shown to be effective without any special nutritional preparation. But there are a handful of eating strategies that simply make sense to best support your body's needs, both before and after you have the jab. </p>
<p> Avoid alcohol before and after your vaccination </p>
<p> As Health previously reported, there are a few key reasons to nix alcohol for at least a few days before and after receiving the vaccine. While some people have minimal or no vaccine side effects, others may experience fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Even light alcohol consumption can trigger dehydration, which may intensify these side effects. And if you're dehydrated or have a bit of a hangover, it may be difficult to distinguish between your body's reaction to the alcohol versus the vaccine. </p>
<p> Drinking alcohol has also been shown to stress the immune system. In a paper published in the journal Alcohol Research, researchers noted that there's been a long-observed relationship between excessive alcohol intake and a weakened immune response. And while alcohol may help you fall asleep faster, it triggers more sleep disturbances and interferes with overall sleep quality and duration, another disruptor of optimal immune function. </p>
<p> Eat for sleep, especially the night before </p>
<p> Being well-rested helps your immune system work to its fullest potential. To ramp up your sleep quality before you get vaccinated, be strategic about what you eat, especially for dinner. </p>
<p> A study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that eating too little fiber (fruits, veggies, whole grains, pulses, nuts, and seeds) and too much saturated fat and sugar (fatty meat, dairy products, sweets) can lead to less restorative, more disturbed sleep. In contrast, a higher fiber intake led to more time in deep, high-quality, slow wave sleep. In the study, volunteers also fell asleep faster after eating meals provided by a dietitian, compared to those who selected their own meals. </p>
<p> Dinner meals that meet sleep-supporting criteria include hearty lentil soup paired with a garden salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) vinaigrette; wild Alaskan salmon paired with EVOO sautéed broccoli and roasted fingerling potatoes; a veg-packed stir-fry with citrus and lima beans over wild rice, topped with chopped cashews; and chickpea pasta tossed with EVOO, garlic, herbs, and a generous portion of oven roasted veggies. </p>
<p> If you need a snack between dinner and bedtime, reach for fresh fruit and/or nuts. But to allow your food to properly digest, try to give yourself about three hours between the time you finish eating and the time you go to sleep. As for beverages, be sure to cut off caffeine at least six hours before bedtime. And curb fluid consumption in the evening so you won't have to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. </p>
<p> Stay well-hydrated </p>
<p> Being well-hydrated is one of the most important ways to maximize how you feel, both before and after your vaccination. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), women need 2.7 liters of total fluid per day (over 11 cups), and men need 3.7 liters (over 15 cups). About 20% of our fluids come from food, but that still leaves 8-12 cups, based on the IOM's guidelines, not including additional needs due to exercise. </p>
<p> I recommend aiming for eight 8-ounce cups, spread evenly throughout the day. Think of your day in four blocks: 1) from the time you get up to mid-morning; 2) mid-morning to lunchtime; 3) lunchtime to mid-afternoon; and 4) mid-afternoon to dinnertime. Aim for 2 cups (16 ounces) of water during each of these blocks. Set your cell phone alarm as a reminder if you need to. And if you're not a fan of plain water, spruce up your H2O with healthful add-ins, like lemon, lime, fresh mint, sliced cucumber, fresh ginger, or slightly mashed bits of in-season fruit. </p>
<p> Swap processed foods for whole foods </p>
<p> Studies have shown that, during the pandemic, people have increased their consumption of foods high in sodium, added sugars, and/or total fats. With all the hardship and uncertainty this year has brought, it's no wonder why many have increased their comfort food intake. But over time, highly processed foods can fuel inflammation; and systemic chronic inflammation can impair normal immune function. </p>
<p> In a 2020 article published in the British Journal of Nutrition, scientists concluded that healthy eating habits are important for COVID-19 prevention. While studies about the effects of nutrition on the vaccine haven't been published, it holds true that the best way to support your immune system post-vaccination is to prioritize nutrient-rich, anti-inflammatory whole foods. </p>
<p> One of the top strategies is to simply eat more veggies and fruit. According to the CDC, only one in 10 Americans eats the recommended minimum 2-3 cups of veggies and 1.5-2 cups of fruit daily. To hit the mark, work veggies into both lunch and dinner meals, and incorporate fruit into breakfast and a daily snack. </p>
<p> Eat a balanced meal before your appointment </p>
<p> While fainting isn't listed as a common COVID-19 vaccine side effect, the CDC has received reports of people fainting after nearly all vaccines. But fainting during or after a vaccination is typically triggered by anxiety or pain rather than the vaccine itself. In addition to getting some reassurance about the procedure, drinking a beverage and eating a snack before the vaccination process have been shown to sometimes prevent anxiety-related fainting, the CDC says. </p>
<p> In addition to anxiety or pain, low blood sugar can also cause fainting. So eating a meal that helps regulate your blood sugar before your shot is a smart strategy, especially if you have a history of feeling faint during any vaccination process. Your best bet for blood sugar regulation is a combo of veggies, paired with lean protein, nutrient- and fiber-rich carbs, and healthy fat. </p>
<p> If your appointment is in the morning, consider eating "zoats," oatmeal mixed with shredded zucchini, fruit, and nuts or seeds. Or go for a veggie and avocado omelet (made with eggs or chickpeas) with a side of fresh fruit. If your appointment is in the afternoon, fuel up with a grain bowl, made with greens and veggies, lentils, quinoa, and tahini, or a taco salad, made with greens, salsa, black beans, roasted corn, and guacamole. </p>
<p> If you get nervous before your appointment and you don't feel like eating, try a smoothie made with spinach, plant protein powder or Greek yogurt, plant milk, banana, berries, and nut butter. Or sip a green juice and nibble a fruit and nut bar. </p>
<p> Shop for post-vaccine foods ahead of time </p>
<p> Some people develop nausea after the vaccine. That may not happen to you, but just in case, try to plan ahead and stock up on some bland and easy-to-digest foods (think: what you'd eat when you have the flu). Good options include broth-based veggie soup, bananas, applesauce, melon, coconut water, brown rice, and potatoes. </p>
<p> Avoid heavy foods like cheesy dishes, cream sauces, fried foods, and meat, as well as sugary foods, including candy and baked goods. Stay well-hydrated, and when the nausea subsides, continue to focus on fresh, whole foods. </p>
<p> After my vaccination, I didn't feel nauseous, but I did lose my appetite. If that happens to you, try to eat small meals or snacks every few hours; eat a variety of foods so you don't miss out on important nutrients. </p>
<p> If you're hungry but too tired to cook, order a healthy takeout meal, like Thai stir-fry, a Mediterranean platter, veggie tacos, or Indian curry. </p>
<p> Vaccine side effects should go away within a few days. But healthy habits, like drinking more water and eating nutrient-rich meals, can bring lasting wellness benefits. If you've been in a bit of a pandemic pothole, think of your vaccination as an opportunity to kick-start a healthier, sustainable routine. </p>

<p> What to Eat After Surgery and What to Avoid </p>
<p> Jennifer Whitlock, RN, MSN, FNP-C, is a board-certified family nurse practitioner. She has experience in primary care and hospital medicine. </p>
<p> Scott Sundick, MD, is a board-certified vascular and endovascular surgeon. He currently practices in Westfield, New Jersey. </p>
<p> If you have had surgery, the food you eat can make a great impact on your recovery and on how quickly your wound heals. Eating the right foods can prevent complications, such as constipation and high blood glucose, and provide the necessary building blocks of protein your skin needs to heal quickly. </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Reassess Your Typical Diet </p>
<p> One of the best things you can do to improve your nutritional status when you are recovering from surgery is to focus on whole foods. That means to choose foods that are “whole” or unprocessed. </p>
<p> For example, an orange would be a whole food. Orange juice, though, would be a more processed version of that food. A baked potato is a whole food, while a french fry is more processed and less healthy, having been fried. The list goes on and on—chicken breast is better than chicken nuggets, onions are better than onion rings. </p>
<p> So, aim to obtain most of your nutrition from these whole foods, which is actually a healthy way to eat every day, not just the weeks following surgery. Processed foods tend to have higher amounts of fat, sugar, salt, and chemical additives, but far less fiber and vitamins than their whole food counterparts.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> One easy way to stick to more nutritious, less-processed foods is to focus on the outside aisles of the grocery store. Most grocery stores are set up with unprocessed foods on the outermost areas of the store in the produce, butcher/fish, dairy, and bread areas. </p>
<p> By doing most of your shopping in those areas, you will naturally choose healthier foods that are high in fiber—a vital nutrient to include in your diet after surgery. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Why Plenty of Fiber Is a Must </p>
<p> It is important to include fiber in your diet as you are recovering from surgery.﻿﻿ Not only are high-fiber foods healthier than their low-fiber counterparts, but fiber also plays a major role in preventing constipation, a common complication after surgery. </p>
<p> Constipation is more than just annoying after surgery, it can actually increase pain and the chances of returning to the hospital during the recovery period. </p>
<p> Rather than adding a fiber supplement to your day, such as psyllium husks, consider adding high fiber foods to your diet and obtaining fiber in a more natural way. Supplementing is not a bad idea, but fiber from food tends to work better to prevent constipation when taken with ample water. </p>
<p> High-Fiber Foods </p>
<p> Enjoy these high-fiber foods: </p>
<p> Whole grain bread: Look for breads that use whole grains and are darker in color. White bread is typically too refined to be a good source of fiber. </p>
<p> Whole grains: This would include corn, oatmeal, and other grains. </p>
<p> Fruits: Fresh fruit is an excellent source of vitamins and fiber. </p>
<p> Vegetables: Vegetables are an excellent source of fiber and can be purchased fresh or frozen. </p>
<p> Cereal: Not all cereal has a high-fiber content. Check the label to avoid sugary or low-fiber cereal. Look for cereal with fiber in the name, or stick with old-fashioned breakfast foods, such as oatmeal or cream of wheat. </p>
<p> Avoid Foods That Cause Constipation </p>
<p> Constipation is common after surgery because prescription pain medications—opioids, in particular—are often used in the days following a surgical procedure and have a known side effect of decreasing the movement of the intestines.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> While some foods can help prevent or treat constipation, there are other foods that can make constipation more likely. Constipation can increase your pain level and can place additional stress on your incision, so it is important to avoid whenever possible. </p>
<p> Foods Likely to Cause Constipation </p>
<p> These foods may contribute to constipation: </p>
<p> Dried or dehydrated foods: These include dried fruits (prunes are an exception, they can help to ease constipation), beef jerky, and some types of potato chips. </p>
<p> Processed foods: These foods have little fiber and may be high in sugar and fat. </p>
<p> Cheese: Cheese is high in fat. </p>
<p> Milk and dairy products: Especially avoid full-fat dairy products, including ice cream and sour cream. </p>
<p> Red meat: Beef and other kinds of red meat are often high in saturated fat. </p>
<p> Sweets: These include pastries, candies, cakes, and other sugary foods. </p>
<p> Focus on Lean Protein </p>
<p> Lean protein can be found in lean meats, such as chicken, turkey, and pork. Seafood, including fish, is also an excellent source of lean protein. Red meat is not recommended because of the high level of saturated fat and because it can trigger constipation. </p>
<p> If you don’t eat meat or don’t enjoy meat, remember that protein comes from many sources other than meat. Consider nuts, tofu, beans and “vegetarian” foods, such as tempeh and texturized vegetable protein (TVP) to supplement your protein needs. </p>
<p> Dairy products are also a source of protein, but they can cause constipation, so they should be used in moderation. If you are having difficulty eating, consider supplementing your diet with protein powder, which can be added to drinks, such as smoothies.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Whole Grains Instead of Refined Grains </p>
<p> Whole grains are an excellent source of vitamins and minerals as well as fiber.﻿﻿ Be sure to choose whole grain breads and cereals whenever possible, rather than the refined "white" versions. </p>
<p> Rice is a great way to add whole grains to your diet, but many types of rice are so processed that the nutritional value is minimal. For both nutrients and fiber content, choose brown rice or other varieties that are not processed, and avoid white rice. </p>
<p> Breakfast is an ideal time to add whole grains and fiber to your diet. Skip the bacon and eggs and choose oatmeal or another whole grain cereal, whole wheat bread, and fresh fruit for your morning meal. </p>
<p> If you have had surgery on your intestines, make sure you are permitted to eat whole grains during your recovery before adding them to your diet. Pay particular attention to your discharge instructions regarding what is appropriate to eat during your recovery. </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> Fresh Fruits and Vegetables </p>
<p> Fresh fruit and vegetables contain both nutrients and fiber, which are essential to healing during your recovery from surgery. While fresh is best, frozen or canned items are also good. Try to emphasize items that are not processed, such as fresh broccoli, and avoid processed foods, such as canned broccoli soup. </p>
<p> One side effect of eating more fruits and vegetables than usual is gas. While this can be an annoying or embarrassing problem, it should pass within a day or two. </p>
<p> If the gas is so severe that you feel stomach pressure or abdominal cramping, you can decrease your intake of fresh produce or use a gas reliever, such as Beano to prevent gas﻿﻿ or Gas-X (simethicone) to relieve gas that is present. </p>
<p> 7 </p>
<p> Substitute Low-Fat Dairy Products </p>
<p> Dairy products are an excellent source of protein, which is essential to healing after surgery. Many people, though, find that consuming dairy products can lead to constipation after surgery. There is also evidence that dairy products can increase secretions in the lungs, so if you have a chronic cough, it may be worthwhile to avoid dairy products in the short term. </p>
<p> If you can eat dairy products without becoming constipated, focus on low-fat items, such as skim milk, cottage cheese, and yogurt. Cheese, low-fat or not, should be eaten in moderation until you can determine if eating it will cause you to become constipated. </p>
<p> Trouble Eating Enough After Surgery? </p>
<p> Sometimes it is difficult to eat after surgery because of a lack of appetite. This typically passes a few days after surgery, but it is important to continue eating nutritious foods during this part of your recovery. Constipation can cause a lack of appetite. If this is the case, speak to your surgeon about ways to relieve constipation before taking over-the-counter remedies. </p>
<p> While most people in America could stand to lose a few pounds, skipping meals after surgery is not the way to do it. Failing to eat enough after surgery can slow healing and delay the closure of your incision. Your body needs protein and other nutrients to build healthy new tissue and heal tissue injured by surgery. </p>
<p> If you are not constipated and are still having difficulty with your appetite, consider calorie-dense foods, such as a smoothie, which can contain dairy, fruit and even protein powder as necessary. </p>
<p> If you are unable to consume enough calories after your surgery, try to eat calorie-dense foods whenever possible. That means eating foods that contain more calories per bite than others. For example, a cup of green salad would be a food low in calories per cup, while avocado would be very high in calories per cup. </p>
<p> If consuming enough calories is an issue, you may want to eliminate low-calorie and calorie-free items from your diet until you are able to eat adequately. For example, use regular salad dressing, replace diet soda with juice or full-calorie soda and (in general) avoid foods that say "lite," "sugar-free," "calorie-free," "diet," "low-fat," or "low-calorie" on the label. </p>
<p> 9 </p>
<p> Easy Ways to Add Calories to Your Diet </p>
<p> If you are having difficulty getting enough calories in your diet after surgery, your recovery could be adversely affected. These tips can help you add calories to your diet without having to eat noticeably more; however, these changes are not necessarily heart-healthy and are not going to aid weight loss. </p>
<p> This way of eating is reserved for people who are unable to consume enough calories, as this is not an ideal nutritional plan for the long term. Some individuals truly struggle to consume enough food in the early part of the recovery phase, and these tips are intended for those people. </p>
<p> When you are able to return to a healthier diet, eliminating saturated fats and sugar while emphasizing fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, it is important to do so. </p>
<p> 12 Ways to Sneak Calories Into Your Diet </p>
<p> Follow these tips: </p>
<p> Use heavy cream instead of non-fat dairy creamer. </p>
<p> Use real sugar, not a sugar substitute. </p>
<p> Use real butter or margarine, not low-calorie butter spreads or sprays. </p>
<p> Cook with oil, not with cooking spray. </p>
<p> Choose full-calorie options if possible when eating prepared foods, such as frozen meals. For example, don't select Weight Watchers frozen meals, as they are calorie-controlled, choose a full-calorie version. </p>
<p> Suck on mints or candy. </p>
<p> Eat the highest calorie items on your plate first. </p>
<p> Keep a full-calorie beverage (juice, lemonade, soda) nearby, and drink from it whenever possible. </p>
<p> Add a dietary supplement, such as Ensure or protein bars, to your diet. </p>
<p> Snack between meals. </p>
<p> Use high-calorie snacks, such as nuts and seeds. </p>
<p> Think of eating as your job, and do it frequently. Consider commercial breaks on television to be a reminder to have a nibble. </p>
<p> Choose vegetables with more calories, such as avocados and potatoes rather than lettuce. </p>
<p> Add a bedtime snack to your schedule. </p>
<p> Frequently Asked Questions </p>
<p> What can you eat if you're feeling nauseous after surgery? </p>
<p> To keep up your strength, try eating small amounts of bland foods throughout the day. Flat ginger ale, chicken broth, crackers, plain toast, and bananas can be good options. Hard ginger candies or peppermints may also help to soothe your stomach. </p>
<p> What should you eat after oral surgery? </p>
<p> Your doctor or dentist will give you directions for what you can eat after oral surgery. You'll probably be instructed to drink liquids and eat soft foods for the first few days. Some good examples might be smoothies, milkshakes, apple sauce, pudding, ice cream, soup, and protein shakes. </p>
<p> What should you eat after gallbladder surgery? </p>
<p> You may notice changes in your digestive system after your gallbladder is removed. Fatty foods in particular may be more difficult for your body to process. Avoid high-fat or fried foods for several weeks to limit gastrointestinal pain or discomfort. Try to keep your calories from fat at 30% or less of your daily calorie intake. </p>
<p> A Word From Verywell </p>
<p> What you eat in the days and weeks following surgery can help determine how quickly you heal and how well you feel while recovering. Take the time to eat well, choosing foods you know to be healthful and nutritious, and be sure to eat enough calories to sustain your body through the healing process. </p>

<p> What Foods Are Best to Eat on an Intermittent Fasting Diet? </p>
<p> Medically reviewed by Adrienne Seitz, MS, RD, LDN — Written by Natalie Rizzo — Updated on September 27, 2020 </p>
<p> We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process. </p>
<p> Before changing your diet in any significant way, please speak with a health professional to make sure it’s the best decision for you. </p>
<p> Although the word “fasting” sounds pretty ominous, intermittent fasting (IF) is causing quite a stir in the overcrowded world of dieting. </p>
<p> A decent amount of research (although with less-than-massive sample sizes) suggests that the diet can lead to weight loss and improved blood sugar levels.Stockman M-C, et al. (2018). Intermittent fasting: Is the wait worth the weight? https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5959807/ No wonder everyone and their aunt seems to be jumping on the IF bandwagon. </p>
<p> Maybe the appeal is in the lack of food rules: There are restrictions on when you can eat but not necessarily on what you can eat. </p>
<p> However, the what is also important. Should you be downing pints of ice cream and bags of chips in between fasts? Probably not. That’s why we’ve come up with a list of the best foods to include in your IF life. </p>
<p> “There are no specifications or restrictions about what type or how much food to eat while following intermittent fasting,” says Lauren Harris-Pincus, MS, RDN, author of The Protein-Packed Breakfast Club. </p>
<p> But Mary Purdy, MS, RDN, chair of Dietitians in Integrative and Functional Medicine, counters that by advising that “the benefits [of IF] are not likely to accompany consistent meals of Big Macs.” </p>
<p> Pincus and Purdy agree that a well-balanced diet is the key to losing weight, maintaining energy levels, and sticking with the diet. </p>
<p> “Anyone attempting to lose weight should focus on nutrient-dense foods like fruits, veggies, whole grains, nuts, beans, seeds, as well as dairy and lean proteins,” suggests Pincus. </p>
<p> Purdy adds, “My recommendations wouldn’t be very different from the foods I might normally suggest for improved health — high-fiber, unprocessed, whole foods that offer variety and flavor.” </p>
<p> In other words, eat plenty of the below foods and you won’t end up in a hangry rage while fasting. </p>
<p> 1. Water </p>
<p> OK, OK, so this isn’t technically a food, but it’s gosh-danged important for getting through IF. </p>
<p> Water is central to the health of basically every major organ in your body. You’d be foolish to avoid this as part of your fast. Your organs are pretty important for, ya know, being alive. </p>
<p> The amount of water each person should drink varies based on sex, height, weight, activity level, and climate.Meinders A-J, et al. (2010). How much water do we really need to drink? https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20356431/ But a good measure is the color of your urine. You want it to be pale yellow at all times. </p>
<p> Dark yellow urine suggests dehydration, which can cause headaches, fatigue, and lightheadedness. Couple that with limited food and you’ve got a recipe for disaster — or, at the very least, really dark pee. </p>
<p> If the thought of plain water doesn’t excite you, add a squeeze of lemon juice, a few mint leaves, or some cucumber slices to your water. </p>
<p> 2. Avocado </p>
<p> It may seem counterintuitive to eat the highest-calorie fruit while trying to lose weight. But, due to their high unsaturated fat content, avocados will keep you full during even the fastiest of fasting periods. </p>
<p> Research suggests unsaturated fats help keep your body full even when you don’t feel full.Stevenson JL, et al. (2017). Hunger and satiety responses to high-fat meals after a high-polyunsaturated fat diet: A randomized trial. DOI: 10.1016/j.nut.2017.03.008 Your body gives off signs that it has enough food and isn’t about to go into emergency starvation mode. Unsaturated fats keep these signs going for longer, even if you feel a bit hungry in the middle of a fasting period. </p>
<p> Another study even found that adding half an avocado to your lunch may keep you full for hours longer than if you didn’t eat that green, mushy gem.Wien M. (2013). A randomized 3×3 crossover study to evaluate the effect of Hass avocado intake on post-ingestive satiety, glucose and insulin levels, and subsequent energy intake in overweight adults. DOI: 10.1186/1475-2891-12-155 </p>
<p> 3. Fish and seafood </p>
<p> In addition to being rich in healthy fats and protein,Hosomi R, et al. (2012). Seafood consumption and components for health. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4776937/ it contains ample amounts of vitamin D.Güttler N, et al. (2012). Seafood consumption and components for health. DOI: 10.1155/2012/729670 </p>
<p> And if eating during limited windows is your bag, don’t you want more nutritional bang for your buck when you do chow down? </p>
<p> 4. Cruciferous veggies </p>
<p> Foods like broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cauliflower are all full of the f-word — fiber! (We know what you were thinking, and no, the f-word is not “farts.”) </p>
<p> When you’re eating during certain intervals, it’s crucial to eat fiber-rich foods that will keep you regular and help your poop factory run smoothly. </p>
<p> Fiber can also make you feel full, which may be a good thing if you can’t eat again for 16 hours.Clarke MJ, et al. (2013). The effect of fiber on satiety and food intake: A systematic review. DOI: 10.1080/07315724.2013.791194 Woof. </p>
<p> Cruciferous veggies can also reduce your cancer risk. Learn more about anticancer foods here. </p>
<p> 5. Potatoes </p>
<p> Repeat after us: Not all white foods are bad. </p>
<p> Case in point: Research in the ’90s found that potatoes were one of the most satiating foods.Holt SH, et al. (1995). A satiety index of common foods. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7498104/ And a 2012 study found that eating potatoes as part of a healthy diet could help with weight loss.Randolph JM, et al. (2014). Potatoes, glycemic index, and weight loss in free-living individuals: Practical implications. DOI: 10.1080/07315724.2013.875441 (Sorry, but french fries and potato chips don’t count.) </p>
<p> 5. Beans and legumes </p>
<p> Your favorite addition to chili may be your best friend on the IF lifestyle. </p>
<p> Food, specifically carbs, supplies energy for activity. We’re not telling you to carb-load to ridiculous levels, but it definitely wouldn’t hurt to throw some low calorie carbs like beans and legumes into your eating plan. This can keep you perked up during your fasting hours. </p>
<p> Plus, foods like chickpeas, black beans, peas, and lentils have been shown to decrease body weight, even without calorie restriction.Clark S, et al. (2017). The role of pulses in satiety, food intake and body weight management. DOI: 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.044 </p>
<p> 6. Probiotics </p>
<p> You know what the little critters in your gut like the most? Consistency and diversity. That means they aren’t happy when they’re hungry. And when your gut isn’t happy, you may experience some irritating side effects, like constipation.Zhao Y, et al. (2016). Intestinal microbiota and chronic constipation. DOI: 10.1186/s40064-016-2821-1 </p>
<p> To counteract this unpleasantness, add probiotic-rich foods — like kefir, kombucha, and sauerkraut — to your diet. </p>
<p> 7. Berries </p>
<p> These staples of your favorite smoothie are ripe with vital nutrients. And that’s not even the best part. </p>
<p> A 2016 study found that people who consumed a whole bunch of flavonoids, such as those in blueberries and strawberries, had smaller increases in BMI over a 14-year period than people who didn’t eat berries.Bertoia ML. (2016) Dietary flavonoid intake and weight maintenance: Three prospective cohorts of 124 086 US men and women followed for up to 24 years. DOI: 10.1136/bmj.i17 </p>
<p> 8. Eggs </p>
<p> One large egg provides 6.24 grams of protein and cooks up in minutes. And getting as much protein as possible is important for keeping full and building muscle, especially when you’re eating less. </p>
<p> A 2010 study found that men who ate an egg breakfast instead of a bagel were less hungry and ate less throughout the day.Ratliff J, et al. (2010). Consuming eggs for breakfast influences plasma glucose and ghrelin, while reducing energy intake during the next 24 hours in adult men. DOI: 10.1016/j.nutres.2010.01.002 </p>
<p> In other words, when you’re looking for something to do during your fasting period, why not hard-boil the heck out of some eggs? Then, you can eat them when the time is right. </p>
<p> 9. Nuts </p>
<p> They may be higher in calories than many other snacks, but nuts contain something most snack foods don’t: good fats. </p>
<p> And if you’re worried about calories, don’t be! A 2012 study found that a 1-ounce serving of almonds (about 23 nuts) has 20 percent fewer calories than listed on the label.Novotny JA, et al. (2012). Discrepancy between the Atwater factor predicted and empirically measured energy values of almonds in human diets. DOI: 10.3945/ajcn.112.035782 </p>
<p> According to the study, chewing doesn’t completely break down almond cell walls. This leaves a portion of the nut intact, and your body doesn’t absorb it during digestion. So if you eat almonds, they might not make as big a dent in your daily calorie intake as you thought. </p>
<p> 10. Whole grains </p>
<p> Being on a diet and eating carbs seem like they belong in two different buckets. You’ll be super relieved to know that this isn’t always the case. Whole grains provide lots of fiber and protein, so eating a little goes a long way toward keeping you full.Venn B, et al. (2012). Whole grains, legumes, and health. DOI: 10.1155/2012/903767 </p>
<p> So go ahead and venture out of your comfort zone toward a whole-grain utopia of farro, bulgur, spelt, kamut, amaranth, millet, sorghum, or freekeh. </p>
<p> We’ve given you the lowdown on IF before, but here’s a little refresher for the new students in class. (You two in the back, stop texting!) </p>
<p> While the foods above will give you the most obvious benefits from the diet, it’s the “fasting” part of IF that provides the oomph. </p>
<p> There are loads of IF plans, but most focus on fasting for a certain number of hours in the day or days of the week. </p>
<p> Here’s a breakdown of the most popular IF models: </p>
<p> The 12:12 method: Fast for 12 hours a day and eat within a 12-hour window. If you eat your last meal at 7 p.m. and have breakfast the next morning at 7 a.m., congratulations, you’re already an IF pro. (This is good for beginners.) </p>
<p> The 20:4 method: Fast for a full 20 hours and allow yourself one 4-hour window to eat. </p>
<p> The 16:8 method: Eat your daily food within an 8-hour window and fast for the remaining 16 hours. </p>
<p> The 5:2 method: Eat whatever you want for 5 days out of the week. For the other 2 days, men can consume 600 calories, while women can consume 500 calories. </p>
<p> IF isn’t the only way to lose weight, and like any other method, it comes with some risks and downsides. </p>
<p> There are risks to IF, such as tiredness, irritability, and headaches. Dehydration is also possible if you don’t drink enough water during fasting periods. </p>
<p> Research on rats suggests that IF may even contribute to infertility.Kumar S, et al. (2013). Intermittent fasting dietary restriction regimen negatively influences reproduction in young rats: A study of hypothalamo-hypophysial-gonadal axis. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0052416 And athletes might find that they break down muscle instead of building it due to the timing of when they work out in the energy cycle.Aragon AA, et al. (2013). Nutrient timing revisited: Is there a post-exercise anabolic window? DOI: 10.1186/1550-2783-10-5 </p>
<p> The fasting/feasting routine is also potentially unrealistic in the long term and may lead to binge eating during feasting periods, which won’t support any weight management goals. </p>
<p> If you eat the above foods during bouts of yo-yo dieting, they may not provide the nutritional benefits they usually would. When your body is under stress due to eating too few calories, it won’t use the nutrients you do take in to their fullest extent. </p>
<p> Steady, sustainable weight loss over a longer period might be safer. There’s not much research on IF right now, so its long-term effects are more or less a mystery. </p>
<p> It’s best to talk to a dietitian or nutritionist before embarking on IF — it’s not for everyone. </p>
<p> IF is not an excuse to eat with abandon — you’ve gotta choose your foods wisely. And the foods on this list should play major roles in your diet whether or not you fast. </p>
<p> We put together 22 ways that you can eat healthfully — plus, they’re simple and cheap. </p>

<p> When You Eat Fish Every Day, This Is What Happens To Your Body </p>
<p> There's no denying the fact that fish is thought to be one of the healthiest foods out there, as noted by Healthline. For many people, fish may not be the most appetizing option, but the merits of eating a diet with a good amount of fish in it tend to outweigh any negatives. Additionally, eating fish is actually better for the environment than eating meat is, so many people have adopted pescatarian diets in order to reduce their carbon footprints, according to Oceana.org. And it turns out that there are some fish most people aren't eating that they definitely should be. </p>
<p> That said, is fish really that good for you? Are the positive effects of eating fish really worth it? Moreover, what happens to your body when you eat fish every day? Well, the truth is a little more complicated than you might think. While fish is certainly a healthy source of protein and does have a lot of perks, that doesn't necessarily mean that eating it every day will change your entire life. On the other hand, there could be a lot of changes to your body if you were to incorporate fish into your daily diet. </p>
<p> You may boost your brain's health if you eat fish every day </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> There are so many health benefits to eating fish that it can be hard to keep track of them all. But if you eat fish every day, you're likely going to have a healthy brain. Because fish is high in omega-3, your brain may benefit from the increase in fish to your diet. "Omega-3 intake is positively linked to a healthy brain," according to the Global Organization of EPA and DHA Omega-3s, as reported by BuzzFeed News. </p>
<p> Additionally, a study published in JAMA Neurology (via National Institutes of Health) found that eating fish regularly can actually help manage the cognitive decline that tends to happen with age. "Fish intake was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in mixed models adjusted for age, sex, race, education, cognitive activity, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and total energy intake," per the study. That isn't to say that eating fish every day will magically raise your IQ or help you pass a big test, but it has been proven to help with cognitive ability, which is pretty cool. So why not consider learning recipes to help you eat more fish? </p>
<p> You could help your eye health if you eat fish every day </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Much as your brain and cognitive abilities tend to decline as you get older, so does your vision. Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in adults (usually older adults), and it's definitely something people want to prevent if they can. That said, one way to decrease the risk of age-related macular degeneration is to add fish to your daily diet. </p>
<p> In fact, according to one study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (via National Institutes of Health), "fish intake, the major source of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration." Specifically, "eating oily fish at least once per week compared with less than once per week was associated with a halving of the odds of [neovascular age-related macular degeneration]," the study noted. Now, this doesn't mean that eating fish every day will give you X-ray vision or mean that you don't need glasses anymore, but all the omega-3s and healthy fats in fish can assist in preventing age-related macular degeneration, according to Healthline, which is a pretty big deal. </p>
<p> If you're pregnant, eating fish every day could help your baby's health </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> If you're pregnant or have ever been pregnant, then chances are, you've heard all about the kinds of foods you can't eat while growing a human. Not too much caffeine, no deli meat, no alcohol, and so on. However, eating fish while pregnant is great. Well, within reason. Because fish is high in mercury, "pregnant women should only eat low-mercury fish, such as salmon, sardines, and trout, and no more than 12 ounces (340 grams) per week," according to Healthline. And pregnant women should also only eat cooked fish, per the site. </p>
<p> That said, the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) found in fish are great for growing a healthy baby. According to a study published in the Journal of Perinatal Medicine (via National Institutes of Health), "the fetus and neonate should receive LC-PUFA in amounts sufficient to support optimal visual and cognitive development." But that's not all. The study also found that "the consumption of oils rich in n-3 LC-PUFA during pregnancy reduces the risk for early premature birth," noting, "Pregnant and lactating women should aim to achieve an average daily intake of at least 200 mg DHA." </p>
<p> Fish is awesome when you're pregnant — just don't eat more than 12 ounces each week. </p>
<p> You may be less likely to suffer a heart attack if you eat fish every day </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Just about everyone wants to have a healthy heart. According to the World Health Organization, heart disease is a leading cause of premature death across the globe. Naturally, you would want to do everything you can to prevent that from happening to you. Because of all the omega-3s in fish, it's one of the healthiest foods for your heart, according to Healthline. </p>
<p> Additionally, numerous studies have linked an increase in eating fish with a healthier heart and a decreased risk of heart disease or failure. According to one study published in Public Health Nutrition (via National Institutes of Health), "either low (1 serving/week) or moderate fish consumption (2-4 servings/week) has a significantly beneficial effect on the prevention of [coronary heart disease] mortality." Another study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (via NIH) found that "modest fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of total cardiovascular disease, consistent with cardiac mortality." And finally, yet another study published in Medical Science Monitor (via NIH) discovered that "long-term fish intake is associated with reduced levels of the most common cardiovascular disease risk markers in a cohort of elderly people." </p>
<p> In short, eating fish every day might just make you less susceptible to heart attacks, and that's a pretty good reason to eat up. </p>
<p> If you eat fish every day, you may be less likely to suffer a stroke </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Having a stroke is definitely a traumatic event, and not one anyone wants to experience. But unfortunately, strokes are fairly common. For instance, carotid atherosclerosis, when there is a blockage halting blood from going to your brain, oftentimes leads to stroke, according to the Mayo Clinic. Additionally, cerebrovascular diseases can lead to a risk of stroke and is the fifth-most common cause of death in the United States, according to Medical News Today. Fortunately, eating a diet rich in fish has been shown to decrease those risks. </p>
<p> According to one study published in Nutrition Journal (via National Institutes of Health) "high habitual fish consumption seems to be associated with less carotid atherosclerosis." And that's not all. Another study shared in The BMJ (via NIH) found that "the beneficial effect of fish intake on cerebrovascular risk is likely to be mediated through the interplay of a wide range of nutrients abundant in fish." Strokes may be common, but eating fish every day might just decrease your risk of experiencing one. </p>
<p> Eating fish every day could help manage depression </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> While eating fish can certainly have a lot of impact on one's physical health, the source of protein can also help with one's mental health. Depression is a serious health condition and can impact a person's entire life. "It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working," according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Additionally, "an estimated 17.3 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode" in 2017, per the site, so clearly many likely know depression symptoms people should know about and understand what happens to the body when you're depressed. </p>
<p> As hard as depression can be to manage, a diet rich in fish could actually help. According to a study published in Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity (via National Institutes of Health) for someone diagnosed with depression, "dietary recommendations suggesting proper intake of omega-3 PUFA and dietary interventions including omega-3 PUFA supplement can result in substantial benefits for the general population." As fish are rich in omega-3s, if you eat fish every day, symptoms of depression and depressive episodes might actually decrease. </p>
<p> You may become happier if you eat fish every day </p>

<p> Everyone wants to be happy — that's no secret. But unfortunately, one of the key factors of happiness, vitamin D, tends to be lacking in most people. Specifically, according to a study from Nutrition Research (via National Institutes of Health), "vitamin D deficiency was common in the US population, especially among blacks and Hispanics." Additionally, "vitamin D deficiency is linked to some of the important risk factors of leading causes of death in the United States," which means that a lack of vitamin D can literally be deadly. </p>
<p> That said, "increasing fish consumption or changing consumption patterns could be beneficial and result in noticeable improvements in vitamin D status," another study found. As vitamin D can play a huge role in making people happier, eating fish every day could actually make you happier, as well as prevent risk factors for death. Again, eating fish every day doesn't necessarily mean you'll always be happy, but it can definitely help boost your mood. </p>
<p> You might not have as many asthma-related issues if you eat fish every day </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> One of the most common diseases in America is asthma, which is marked by the swelling of the airways, making it difficult to breathe. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, "more than 25 million Americans have asthma," noting, "This is 7.7 percent of adults and 8.4 percent of children." That said, just because asthma is common, doesn't mean it can't be helped. In fact, if you eat fish every day, your body might actually be able to help with symptoms of asthma. </p>
<p> "Fatty fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids which have anti-inflammatory properties," researcher Maria Papamichael told Science Daily. "Our study shows eating fish just twice a week can significantly decrease lung inflammation in children with asthma." Additionally, a study from the PLOS One (via National Institutes of Health) found that "intake of fish or [long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids] in expectant mothers or infants is inversely associated with asthma development, particularly, in childhood." Fish have a lot of great health benefits, but, if you or your children suffer from asthma, that might just be reason enough to eat it every day. </p>
<p> In kids, eating fish every day might reduce the risk of diabetes </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> Diabetes is a serious health concern across the world, and especially in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "The annual number of children and adolescents age 10 – 19 years diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was 5,300," and a total of 30.3 million Americans suffer from diabetes as of 2017. That's a severe problem and one that only seems to be getting worse. </p>
<p> Fortunately, diabetes can be managed, and a healthy diet is one way to accomplish that. Specifically, fish has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes in both children and adults. A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (via National Institutes of Health) reported, "Cod liver oil may reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes, perhaps through the [anti-inflammatory] effects of long-chain n-3 fatty acids." Another study found that "fatty fish consumption may reduce the risk of [latent autoimmune diabetes in adults], possibly through effects of marine-originated omega-3 fatty acids." Again, eating fish every day won't magically cure all your problems, but as far as diabetes is concerned, it could definitely reduce your risk. </p>
<p> For adults, eating fish every day might mean a decreased risk of autoimmune disease </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> There are a lot of different autoimmune diseases out there, and each one is complicated in its own way. But according to Healthline, they "occur when your immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissues." Fortunately, a diet rich in fish can help prevent certain autoimmune diseases. </p>
<p> For instance, one study published by Arthritis Research & Therapy (via National Institutes of Health) found that there was a "significant inverse association between fish consumption and [rheumatoid arthritis]." Additionally, a different study discovered that "fatty fish intake might decrease the risk for [multiple sclerosis]." The study continued, "A hypothetical explanation is that intake of fatty fish may compensate for vitamin D deficiency that is associated with increased MS risk." </p>
<p> Though there hasn't been a ton of evidence to support fish helping with other autoimmune diseases, the fact that it miight decrease the risk of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis might just make you want to eat it every day. </p>
<p> You could sleep better if you eat fish every day </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> There's no denying the fact that getting enough sleep is something that most adults wish for just about every day. In fact, sleep deprivation is a common struggle for many adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "more than a third of American adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis." Additionally, a study published in Medical Hypotheses (via National Institutes of Health) found that "sleep disorders have become epidemic because of widespread vitamin D deficiency." </p>
<p> Fortunately, fish is a great source of vitamin D, which means that eating it every day might mean your sleep could improve. In fact, another study actually uncovered that "fish consumption seemed to have a positive impact on sleep in general and also on daily functioning." As vitamin D has many positive impacts on your health, eating fish every day means that not only are you going to get more vitamin D, but you'll also probably sleep better. No need to discover firsthand what really happens to your body when you don't sleep! </p>
<p> Eating fish every day may help prevent Alzheimer's </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> One of the most common degenerative diseases in America is Alzheimer's. According to the Alzheimer's Association, 5.8 million Americans are living with the disease. As anyone who has seen The Notebook knows, Alzheimer's can really put families through a tough time, so it would make sense that people would want to decrease their chances of getting it. And per research, fish might help with that. </p>
<p> According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, "moderate seafood consumption was correlated with lesser Alzheimer disease neuropathology." On top of that, the Harvard School of Public Health found that "eating fish once or twice a week may also reduce the risk of stroke, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and other chronic conditions." </p>
<p> Eating fish every day might not make you automatically remember everything from your childhood or be able to recall tiny details you normally would forget, but it can help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's, which is incredible. </p>
<p> You could help clear your acne if you eat fish every day </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> No matter who you are, you've probably gotten a pimple at least once in your lifetime. Acne is totally normal, and, according to Medical News Today, up to 50 million Americans struggle with acne, and it's usually totally treatable. However, sometimes it might feel as though nothing you've tried is helping to clear your acne. Enter: fish. As crazy as it might seem, eating fish every day could destroy your acne. </p>
<p> In fact, a study published in Lipids in Health and Disease (via National Institutes of Health) found that taking fish oil supplements helped clear up acne. "There is some evidence that fish oil supplementation is associated with an improvement in overall acne severity, especially for individuals with moderate to severe acne," per the study. So, if you eat fish every day and get in all those wonderful and powerful Omega-3s and fatty acids, you might start to notice a clear complexion sooner rather than later. </p>
<p> Eating fish probably won't fix all your problems </p>
<p> Shutterstock </p>
<p> It's obvious that eating fish has a lot of health benefits, but that doesn't mean that eating it every day will actually do much of anything for you. In fact, one man actually went on a mission to find out if eating fish often could actually improve his health, and he ate fish every single day for an entire year. But in the end, not much had changed. </p>
<p> Paul Greenberg, who went on said fish mission, released a documentary about his journey, The Fish on My Plate. "I've got slightly elevated blood pressure," he said in the documentary, according to BuzzFeed. "I've got cholesterol issues. I have depression issues. I have sleep issues, and I don't like it. So I started to listen to the soft purr of the omega-3 industry: This is everything they're supposed to fix." But after a year, his health was "virtually the same" and "unchanged." </p>
<p> Fish may be good for you, but it's not magic. And eating it every day certainly won't fix all your problems. </p>

<p> I have often heard from many people that Kshatriyas are allowed to partake non-vegetarian food. Some people who believe Sri Rama took meat (this is due to certain controversial verses present in the Valmiki Ramayana) defend Him by using the argument that Kshatriyas are allowed to consume meat. Do any scriptures allow Kshatriyas to consume non-vegetarian food? </p>
<p> Do any scriptures allow Kshatriyas to consume non-vegetarian food?--- When this is the Q no way one can drop the scripture tag from it.. do not follow everything that others say.. use ur own thinking too.. u mostly tag correctly..so do not remove valid tags from Qs – Rickross Mar 16 '18 at 11:06 </p>
<p> 5 Answers 5 </p>
<p> The Smritis do not allow any of the twice borns to eat meat that is not first offered to Gods or Manes in sacrifice. </p>
<p> Manu Smriti 5.31. ’The consumption of meat (is befitting) for sacrifices,’that is declared to be a rule made by the gods; but to persist (in using it) on other (occasions) is said to be a proceeding worthy of Rakshasas. </p>
<p> Manu Smriti 5.32. He who eats meat, when he honours the gods and manes, commits no sin, whether he has bought it, or himself has killed (the animal), or has received it as a present from others </p>
<p> Manu Smriti 5.33. A twice-born man who knows the law, must not eat meat except in conformity with the law; for if he has eaten it unlawfully, he will, unable to save himself, be eaten after death by his (victims). </p>
<p> So, unlawful consumption of meat is condemned like that in every Hindu scriptures, including the Tantras. </p>
<p> When life is in danger, then of course, one is allowed to eat non-sacrificial meat </p>
<p> Manu Smriti 10.106. Vamadeva, who well knew right and wrong, did not sully himself when, tormented (by hunger), he desired to eat the flesh of a dog in order to save his life. </p>
<p> The verse that is given in this answer is also found in the Manu Smriti: </p>
<p> 5.17. Let him not eat solitary or unknown beasts and birds, though they may fall under (the categories of) eatable (creatures), nor any five-toed (animals). </p>
<p> 5.18. The porcupine, the hedgehog, the iguana, the rhinoceros, the tortoise, and the hare they declare to be eatable; likewise those (domestic animals) that have teeth in one jaw only, excepting camels. </p>
<p> But, that one is not recommended to eat them without any rituals is already made clear from the other Manu Smriti verses given above. </p>

<p> Does any scripture recommend to eat other type of food (let's say Satvik) without offering to God....i believe one should offer food to God first and this shouldn't be restricted to meat only.... – YDS Mar 15 '18 at 11:17 </p>
<p> Yes that may be not restricted to meat eating but that's irrelevant here.. that Kshatriyas are allowed to eat meat and Brahmins are not is a wrong notion.. For Kshatriyas too there's same restriction about eating non sacrificial meat.. @YDS – Rickross Mar 15 '18 at 11:48 </p>
<p> O Rama, Brahmans and Kshatriyas are permitted to eat only the 5 kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., the porcupine, the hedgehog, the alligator, the rabbit and the tortoise. [English translation is taken from source 1 & source2] </p>
<p> Scriptures recommend to follow some rituals before eating food which is already discussed in this Question: </p>

<p> The same state other scriptures including Manu Smriti.. but where does it specify whether a Kshatriya can eat non-sacrificial meat? These animals are allowed to be eaten only if they are first offered to manes or deities in sacrifice. – Rickross Mar 15 '18 at 5:01 </p>
<p> @Rickross other Tamsik, Rajsik, Satvik food must be offered to God before eating..how this makes difference here.. Scriptures say that God must be remembered before each and every action... – YDS Mar 15 '18 at 8:00 </p>
<p> @Rickross We do have a bhojan mantra which we should chant before eating food (be it Tamsik, Rajasik, Satvik)... – YDS Mar 15 '18 at 8:08 </p>
<p> "may be eaten" means those are permitted to be eaten during lawful consumption of meat.. it does not imply that meat of those can be eaten "unlawfully" ... eating meat without rituals is never recommended in any scriptures.. the verse in ur answer is also not doing it.. – Rickross Mar 15 '18 at 8:12 </p>
<p> According to Rāma, if you are a king (kṣatriya) you are allowed to hunt deer for both its flesh and also as a sport. </p>
<p> 31. lakSmaNa = oh, Lakshmana; raajaanaH mahaa vane mR^igayaayaam = kings, in great, forests, in games of hunting; maamsa hetoH api = flesh, for the sake of, even; dhanvinaH [dhanvanaH] = archers [of bows, or, to use bows in sport, archery]; vihaara artham ca = sporting, for purpose of, also; mR^igaan ghnanti = deer, they kill. </p>
<p> Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery. [3-43-31] </p>
<p> Can you name anyone whose mind will not be tempted by this deer? His form has the complexion of molten gold. There are many kinds of celestial jewels. On seeing him, whose mind will not be filled with wonder? On hunts, kings roam around in the great forest. O Lakshmana! Wielding bows, they kill deer for the sake of their flesh. They exert themselves in the great forest and collect many kinds of minerals, gems, jewels and gold. All those riches make men prosper. O Lakshmana! Everything thought of in the mind enhances Shukra's treasure house. O Lakshmana! If a person desires artha and goes around unhesitatingly collecting that artha, those who know the sacred texts about artha say that this artha is true artha. With me, the slender-waisted Vaidehi will be seated on half of this deer's golden and gem-encrusted hide. </p>

<p> But it does not refer to Lord Rama eating any meat. – Pe Dro Oct 26 '20 at 11:38 </p>
<p> The question here was about whether kings in general can hunt deer & eat it. It's not if Rama or Ikshvakus can eat meat. @PeDro – Say No To Censorship Oct 26 '20 at 19:04 </p>
<p> Bhishma in the 116th chapter of Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, declares that Kshatriyas don't commit any sin by eating meat: </p>
<p> "Bhishma said, 'It is even so, O mighty-armed one, as thou sayest. There is nothing on earth that is superior to flesh in point of taste. There is nothing that is more beneficial then flesh to persons that are lean, or weak, or afflicted with disease, or addicted to sexual congress or exhausted with travel. Flesh speedily increases strength. It produces great development. There is no food, O scorcher of foes, that is superior to flesh. But, O delighter of the Kurus, the merits are great that attach to men that abstain from it. Listen to me as I discourse to thee on it. That man who wished to increase his own flesh by the flesh of another living creature is such that there is none meaner and more cruel than he. In this world there is nothing that is dearer to a creature than his life. Hence (instead of taking that valuable possession), one should show compassion to the lives of others as one does to one's own life. Without doubt, O son, flesh has its origin in the vital seed. There is great demerit attaching to its eating, as, indeed, there is merit in abstaining from it. One does not, however, incur any fault by eating flesh sanctified according to the ordinances of the Vedas. The audition is heard that animals were created for sacrifice. They who eat flesh in any other way are said to follow the Rakshasa practice. Listen to me as I tell thee what the ordinance is that has been laid down for the Kshatriyas. They do not incur any fault by eating flesh that has been acquired by expenditure of prowess. All deer of the wilderness were dedicated to the deities and the Pitris in days of old, O king, by Agastya. Hence, the hunting of deer is not censured. There can be no hunting without risk of one's own life. There is equality of risk between the slayer and the slain. Either the animal is killed or it kills the hunter. Hence, O Bharata, even royal sages betake themselves to the practice of hunting. By such conduct they do not become stained with sin. Indeed, the practice is not regarded as sinful. </p>
<p> As per Lord Krishna the highest authority, any killing, especially animals, done by kshatriya is not exempt from sin. </p>
<p> We find multiple examples in Srimad Bhagavatam, e.g. King Prachinabarhi who killed animals during sacrifice and Narada showed him a dark future. </p>
<p> Narada says </p>
<p> All these animals are awaiting your death so that they can avenge the injuries you have inflicted upon them. After you die, they will angrily pierce your body with iron horns. </p>
<p> Srila Prabhupada gives a masterly commentary as always on Narada's words. </p>
<p> in this verse in Srimad Bhagavatam, Lord Krishna instructs Maharaja Muchkunda as follows: </p>
<p> Because you followed the principles of a kṣatriya, you killed living beings while hunting and performing other duties. You must vanquish the sins thus incurred by carefully executing penances while remaining surrendered to Me. </p>

<p> Whole30 Food List: What You Can and Cannot Eat </p>
<p> A fervid lover of the culinary arts and all things Instant Pot, Laurel has been writing about food for 10 years. One of her cookbooks was the #2 cookbook of 2017. </p>
<p> Whole30 is a popular one-month meal plan designed to reset your body. The basic philosophy is that by eliminating commonly problematic foods like alcohol, sugar, grains, and dairy, you will reset your body. Through gradual reintroduction of foods, you can discover what ingredients affect your metabolism, digestion, energy levels, mental health, and more. </p>
<p> Even though the creators of Whole30 don't consider it a "diet," something to keep in mind is that you can only eat certain foods during the 30 days with a list of specific foods that are forbidden. Unlike a normal diet, a single slip up means starting all over again, so it is best to know what you're getting into before you start. As always, it's important to consult with your healthcare professional before starting any diet. </p>
<p> What You Can't Eat </p>
<p> These foods are off-limits during the 30 days of a Whole30 eating plan. Don't eat them or drink them—even a bite or a sip will throw off the whole experiment. </p>
<p> A good general rule is if a food label has a long list of ingredients, it's probably not Whole30 compliant. The focus is on eating real, whole foods and ditching preservative-filled convenience foods. The meal plan also encourages you not to emulate junk foods like pancakes and pizza, even if they're made out of Whole30 compliant ingredients. This is to help change the way you think about food after the month is over. </p>
<p> Alcohol: No beer, wine, or liquor, not even for cooking. </p>
<p> Added sugar: Exclude added sugar and artificial sweeteners of any kind, including popular sugar substitutes like honey, agave, maple syrup, and Stevia. </p>
<p> Dairy: No milk products from any animals including cow, goat, and sheep. This includes cheese, cream, and butter. </p>
<p> Grains: Every kind of grain is out, even if it's gluten-free. This includes oats, wheat, rice, corn, quinoa, buckwheat, rye, barley, and more. Note that ingredients made from grains also count, like germ, starch, and bran. </p>
<p> Legumes: No beans or peas of any kind including soybeans and soy products like tofu, soy sauce, and miso. No peanuts or peanut butter, either. </p>
<p> MSG, Sulfites, or Carrageenan: Be sure to read all food labels carefully and avoid preservatives and highly manufactured ingredients. </p>
<p> Packaged Foods: Foods that may technically comply with Whole30, but are clearly unhealthy such as baked goods, chips, and French fries should be excluded from your diet. </p>
<p> What You Can Eat </p>
<p> While some key groups of foods are excluded while on a Whole30 meal plan, there are still plenty of delicious things you can eat. </p>
<p> Vegetables: All veggies, including carb-rich potatoes, are allowed during Whole30. A healthy mix of different vegetables both cooked and raw is recommended. Sugar snap peas, green beans, and snow peas are allowed. </p>
<p> Meat and Poultry: All meat, including beef and pork and poultry like chicken and turkey, are allowed. Watch out for processed meat like lunch meat and sausage, since they can sometimes have added ingredients like sugar. </p>
<p> Fish: Fresh and canned fish, including salmon and tuna, are perfectly fine to eat while on the diet. </p>
<p> Eggs: Protein-rich eggs are a Whole30 friendly food. </p>
<p> Fruit: Since added sugar is not allowed, fruit can help curb sweet cravings. Eat in moderation, though, since fruit contains lots of natural sugars. Unsweetened fruit juice is also allowed in small amounts. </p>
<p> Nuts: All nuts and seeds are allowed with the exception of peanuts. If you plan to consume nut butters or nut milks, carefully check the labels to avoid added sugars and preservatives. </p>
<p> Fats, Oil, and Vinegar: Extra-virgin olive oil, coconut oil, and even animal fat like lard and schmaltz are okay. Ghee is also Whole30 compliant—making it the only dairy allowed. Vinegar, as long it isn't malt vinegar, are also good to go. </p>
<p> Salt: Whenever possible, use non-iodized salt. </p>
<p> Coffee and Tea: The caffeinated beverages that many people can't live without are allowed on Whole30, but in moderation. Just don't use any sweetener or dairy. </p>
<p> Why Try Whole30? </p>
<p> Following such a strict meal plan with no room for cheating may seem like a daunting task, but it's just for 30 days. Once you get used to carefully reading labels and asking questions at restaurants, you'll get into the swing of things. Some Whole30 participants report better sleep, clearer skin, and more energy. And while it's not the focus of the program, some people lose weight. At the very least, you'll change the way you think about what you put in your body. </p>
<p> Whole30 Disclaimer </p>
<p> It's worth mentioning that Whole30 consistently ranks at the bottom of doctor and dietitians' diet rankings. Some experts consider the program to be unsustainable for most people and potentially unhealthy for others—Whole30 is high in sodium and cholesterol, but low in calcium and other nutrients. The diet may not be a good fit for individuals with hypertension, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. </p>

<p> Social Anxiety and the Fear of Eating in Front of Others </p>
<p> Arlin Cuncic, MA, is the author of "Therapy in Focus: What to Expect from CBT for Social Anxiety Disorder" and "7 Weeks to Reduce Anxiety." </p>
<p> Amy Morin, LCSW, is the Editor-in-Chief of Verywell Mind. She's also a psychotherapist, international bestselling author and host of the The Verywell Mind Podcast. </p>
<p> The fear of eating in front of others can wreak havoc on your social life, work prospects, and adjustment to college. Socializing usually includes some form of food and drink. Business meetings sometimes take place over lunch or dinner. College cafeterias can be crowded. </p>
<p> If eating and drinking in front of others causes you extreme anxiety, you may either endure these situations with great discomfort or avoid them altogether. Avoidance creates a vicious cycle in that the more narrow your life becomes, the harder you will find it to eat and drink in front of others. You may find yourself turning down invitations or making choices that don't require eating in front of others. </p>
<p> Triggers of Fear of Eating in Public </p>
<p> Fear of eating and drinking in front of others can be triggered by a wide variety of situations, foods, and dining companions. </p>
<p> Situation: Some people feel anxious in every situation in which they must eat or drink in front of others, while others fear specific settings such as formal banquets or dinner parties. </p>
<p> Company: Certain individuals become anxious only when eating in front of authority figures. On the other hand, some may be anxious even when eating in front of people whom they know well. </p>
<p> Atmosphere: Some may become more fearful if they are in a crowded restaurant as compared to dining in a quiet setting with only a few companions. </p>
<p> For most people with a fear of eating, the level of anxiety escalates in proportion to how difficult the food is to eat. Finger foods are usually the least threatening. Foods such as salads, soup, and dishes with sauces are usually the most anxiety-provoking. </p>
<p> Potentially messy foods such as spaghetti will be more anxiety-provoking because there is a greater likelihood of embarrassment while eating. Beverages do not usually influence the level of fear, although drinks that are more likely to stain, such as red wine, may provoke more anxiety. </p>
<p> Types of Worries </p>
<p> If you have a fear of eating or drinking in front of others, there is probably a long list of embarrassing events that you worry might happen in these situations. They may include some of the following: </p>
<p> You will choke and draw attention to yourself. </p>
<p> You will vomit or lose control of your bowels. </p>
<p> The Root Cause of Anxiety </p>
<p> Underlying all of this anxiety is the fear of being negatively evaluated by others. A 2015 study found that this fear of negative evaluation explained part of the relationship between social anxiety and aspects of disordered eating.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> In addition, a 2012 study found that social appearance anxiety (the fear that you will be negatively evaluated for your appearance) may predict symptoms of both social anxiety and eating disorder symptoms.﻿﻿ As a result, modifying those underlying negative beliefs or negative social evaluation fears is needed to treat this type of disordered eating, rather than a focus on specific issues with eating. </p>
<p> Treating a Fear of Eating in Public </p>
<p> If difficulty eating in front of others is causing significant impairment in your daily life, and you have not been diagnosed with a mental health disorder, consider making an appointment with your family doctor. Your doctor can help assess the situation and coordinate treatment. </p>
<p> CBT involves identifying negative automatic thoughts and replacing them with more rational thinking patterns. In addition, some form of exposure training usually complements this practice of cognitive restructuring. Exposure may mean actual eating and drinking scenarios in which other group participants act as dining companions. </p>
<p> If your anxiety about eating in front of others is due to an eating disorder, or a combination of an eating disorder and SAD, then treatment will need to be tailored to your unique situation. In addition, if you experience generalized SAD, or your symptoms do not respond to therapy, medication such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be advised. </p>
<p> A Word From Verywell </p>
<p> If you are experiencing difficulty eating in front of others, consider the source of your anxiety. Are you worried about how others will perceive you or more worried about eating the actual food itself? Ask yourself these questions to better understand your own disordered eating patterns and what the next steps may be. </p>

<p> Sometimes after long periods of going without food your immune system gets used to less food so when you beging to try to eat again your body rejects it with can cause you to throw up or just be full sooner so you might consider trying eating smaller portions it may help that's what I had to do </p>

<p> Honestly, there can be a wide variety of reasons why you aren't able to eat as much as you used to. It can be as simple as your hunger has subsided, or to the opposite end of the spectrum (depression). You can try to think about what is potentially causing this to happen. Try to think back to when it began and go from there! </p>

<p> Sometimes you can subconsciously develop an eating disorder without even knowing or wanting to. These types of eating disorders are generally associated with current or remembered traumatic events. The best way to figure out what caused your level of eating to diminish is by consulting a professional therapist. </p>

<p> You may have been eating less recently, so your stomach might have shrunk. If you have't been feeling hungry, you obviously will have eaten less than normal, so you can't expect your stomach to be able to be the exactly the way it was before. </p>

<p> This could be caused by many different reasons. If you are anxious/despressed, your appetite may decrease. This could happen too if you are recovering from an eating disorder. Or perhaps this could be from another underlying health condition, so is important to make an appointment soon with your doctor about this. </p>

<p> As we age our bodies slow down, we are no longer kids, we no longer burn so many calories and do so many things. our metabolisms slow down as we age, its completely normal, just try and balance what you eat with exercise and you should be good </p>

<p> If you have starved yourself before or just simply didn't eat as much, your stomach may have tightened a bit. When we eat lots of food, over time if we overeat our bodies get used to it and can handle the food without feeling pain. And for not eating as much food, our body learns that and so it learns to accept a smaller ammount. </p>
<p> November 6th, 2015 3:10am </p>
<p> Appetite really depends on your body functions. If you are a person who takes medications then lost of appetite can be caused by the side effects of that medication. If you gain weight faster than you used to then you will loss appetite as well. </p>

<p> If you once started to eat less your stomach started to shrink, you cam build up to eat more by adding small porportions! I hope this answer helped you. </p>
<p> August 12th, 2017 3:13pm </p>
<p> This can happen from losing weight and your stomach can not hold as much food anymore. A lot of the time if you have high anxiety your brain will consciously forget about eating and make food seem unappealing. </p>

<p> If you have been eating less your stomach gets used to it and it gets smaller so when you try to eat more food it is harder. Also if you have been excercizing less then you burn less of the calories from the food and as a result are usually less hungry. </p>

<p> Do you feel a loss of appetite? That sounds like a medical problem that needs to be checked out ! Also if it's more like you don't want to eat because you have feelings associated with food or think that you are fat (perceive your body that way) and that's why you don't want to eat.. then that hints at an eating disorder in it's nascent stages. It would be best to get medical attention ASAP. </p>

<p> It's most likely that your metabolism as well as the amount of physical activity you participate in have changed. </p>
<p> March 10th, 2017 8:37pm </p>
<p> Maybe you are in a stressful time period of your life. If you are starving yourself this is not healthy. Talk to some body right away and tell them how you are feeling. If you are truly not hungry then talk to your doctor about what is going on. </p>

<p> This could be answered in many ways, depending on your context. If you're feeling down, you may lose your appetite. If you're being told to eat less by a health professional, you may need less energy each day than you're currently consuming. If you're approaching a ripe old age, your digestive organs may be less functional and you can't digest as much food anymore. </p>

<p> Some people find it hard to eat the same amount every day. This can be due to the fact that your stomach size has shrunk. It could also be because you are dealing with personal stress which can cause you to not want to eat </p>

<p> There could be a number of reasons, as I've found out. You could be feeling a little more down than usual and not feel inclined to eat. Maybe you've lost weight and therefore your stomach has shrunk? There could be any number of reasons, but you should consider yourself as a person and what you've been through recently. </p>

<p> It could be for any number of reasons, from stress to your activity levels. Don't worry about it unless you get to a point where you feel that it is dangerous- if you stop eating completely- then go see a doctor. </p>
<p> July 20th, 2017 11:43am </p>
<p> It may simply be that your appetite has changed for whatever reason. Our appetites can change when we're feeling stressed, depressed, or anxious. Trying to eat small amounts throughout the day instead of big meals is one way of overcoming this problem. </p>
<p> August 13th, 2017 7:29pm </p>
<p> Sometimes you can't eat as much as you used to because your eating habits may have changed. Emotions can alter appetite levels and if you are not eating that much your body starts not asking for a lot of food. </p>

<p> Promoting a faith-based love for all creation. </p>
<p> Why did Jesus Eat Fish? </p>
<p> When it comes to whether God cares about animals, or more pragmatically speaking, whether we should care about animals enough not to hurt or destroy them, one of the most common questions asked is why Jesus ate fish. The logic is that if Jesus ate fish, this proves that God does not care about animals and hence as followers of Jesus we likewise have no reason to care about animals. I believe this line of reasoning is incorrect and serves to hinder the work of God’s holy spirit in the world today. As believers in God and ministers of the Gospel of Christ, I believe we ought to overcome this faulty logic by including animals in our love. In this article we will consider why Jesus ate fish and what bearing that should have on our attitude toward animals in general. </p>
<p> Let’s begin with the passage of Jesus eating fish: </p>
<p> “They [his disciples] gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence” (Luke 24:43). </p>
<p> The purpose of Jesus eating fish in this passage was to prove that he had really risen from the dead and was again alive in the flesh and not just a ghostly apparition. It was to prove that God really has the power to resurrect from the dead and that we would all someday likewise be raised from the dead. So regardless of where we end up regarding our stewardship of God’s creatures, it should at least be clear that the purpose of Jesus eating fish in this passage is not to provide us a license to disregard the welfare of animals but rather to prove that God had really raised him from the dead. </p>
<p> Setting aside the possibility that the Greek word translated “fish” may actually refer to dried seaweed as some scholars believe, even if we assume it was in fact a dead sea creature that Jesus ate, I believe there is still enough evidence that God wants us to care about animals. </p>
<p> Does God care about animals? </p>
<p> Why Jesus ate fish is admittedly one of the harder questions to answer, and there may be a better answer out there than the one I am about to give, but this one is the best I have come across and should hopefully be sufficient to motivate you to care about animals even if Jesus ate fish. </p>
<p> First off, if we assume that Jesus eating fish proves that God does not care about animals and that we thus have no reason to refrain from harming them, then many of the core ideas in the bible would be turned on their head. For instance: </p>
<p> The coming kingdom would be a hell for animals if they are not living at peace in the kingdom. </p>
<p> Fear is the direct result of sin (Genesis 3:10) and is the antithesis of love (1 John 4:18), so causing animals to be afraid by killing them (Gen 9:2, Habakkuk 2:17) would not be consistent with the love God has for all creation and instructs us to likewise have for all creation (Ephesians 1:4). </p>
<p> The prophecy in Isaiah (Isaiah 11:6, 65:25) would end up false, and God’s promise to the animals that one day bow and sword will be banished from the earth and they will lie down safely (Hosea 2:18) would never happen. </p>
<p> If animals are excluded from the new covenant commission “that you should love one another,” (John 13:34) then instead of the new covenant being good news for all creation (Romans 8:19, Mark 16:15), it would be terrible news for the animals since they were included in the original covenant (Genesis 9:9-10). </p>
<p> The many other passages that demonstrate God’s love for animals would no longer make sense. </p>
<p> God’s love would be weaker than the love many people in the world have since many people love animals enough to care about them and not harm them. I don’t believe it is possible to be more loving than God since God is love (1 John 4:8, 16). Therefore if humans are able to love animals and God’s love is at least as strong as the love any human has, then God’s love must also include animals. </p>
<p> So if we assume God does care about animals, then why did Jesus eat fish? </p>
<p> When we look at the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), we see Jesus instructing his followers to hold themselves to a higher standard than is required by the laws given to Moses and to the other Old Testament prophets. He said not only to refrain from adultery but also to refrain from lust (Matthew 5:27-28); not only to refrain from murder but also from hatred (Matthew 5:21-22); not only to love your friends but also your enemies (Matthew 5:43-44). The recurring theme throughout the sermon is to do more than what scripture requires of you, and to do so as an act of devotion to God (Matthew 6:3-4). Many people hear the words of Jesus and wisely put them into practice (Matthew 7:24-25). </p>
<p> Christians today not only have the Old Testament scripture for guidance but also have the instructions given by Jesus, including those spoken in the Sermon on the Mount. So if we carry that same principle that underlies the Sermon on the Mount, namely to do more than what scripture requires, and apply it not only to the Old Testament laws as Jesus did but also to the instructions in the New Testament given by Jesus, Paul, and the rest of the apostles, in what way can we do more than is required by the new covenant? </p>
<p> The new law that Jesus gives us is to love each other (John 13:34, 15:12), and Jesus makes it clear that no one should be excluded from our love – not the poor or needy (Matthew 25:40), not the strangers (Matthew 25:35, Luke 14:13), not those who do evil (Matthew 5:45), and not even our enemies (Matthew 5:44). In fact, our love should be impartial and complete, even perfect (i.e. all-inclusive) just as God’s love is impartial and all-inclusive (Matthew 5:48). </p>
<p> How is it even possible to do more than is required if what is required is to exclude no one from our love? </p>
<p> Well, one way to do more than is required is to not only include all people but also all animals in your love. We know that animals were at peace in the beginning before our disobedience to God caused fear and death to enter into the world (Romans 5:12, Genesis 1:31). We also know that animals will again be at peace as our fellow inhabitants of God’s holy kingdom when the world repents and returns to God and the kingdom comes (Isaiah 11:9, 65:25, Hosea 2:18). And given that Jesus prayed for God’s kingdom to come and his will to be done on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10), it would thus be inevitable that at some point the spirit would implore us to extend our love to animals in order for that kingdom to fully arrive. The good news is that, based on what I see going on in the world today, including within the church, that seems to be exactly what is beginning to happen! Hallelujah! Let your kingdom come! </p>
<p> Let’s consider one final passage that is otherwise very difficult to understand but is illuminated by this explanation of why Jesus ate fish even though eating fish is not part of God’s perfect plan for the kingdom. It comes from the Gospel of John where Jesus describes a sign of those who truly believe in him. He says, “Those who believe in me will do the works I do and will also do greater things because I go to my Father” (John 14:12). The works of Jesus that we are to replicate are the works of mercy (Luke 6:36), the works of humility (John 13:14, James 4:10), the works of devotion to God (Luke 4:8), and the works of love (John 15:13). The greater things must in some sense build on the foundation Jesus laid (Matthew 16:18, Matthew 7:24-25). And if the foundation Jesus laid is an all-inclusive love, then building on that all-inclusive love by including animals in our love would be one way to not only do the works of Jesus but also to do greater works. In other words, doing not only the things Jesus explicitly asks of us (love each other) but also doing more than what Jesus asks of us (love animals) proves that we truly believe in him, according to his own testimony, and it also proves that we are guided by God’s holy spirit (Matthew 7:16, Galatians 5:22-23). </p>
<p> And just so we’re clear, no one is greater than Jesus (John 13:15-16). It is not we who are doing these greater works but God who is doing them in us (Galatians 2:20, Philippians 2:13). We are collectively the living body of Christ on earth today (Romans 12:5, 1 Corinthians 10:16). We are his hands and feet (1 Corinthians 12:27). We are vessels for God’s holy spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19) to work in the world and lamps for God’s light of love to shine upon the world (Matthew 5:14-16). </p>
<p> This is what I believe Jesus means when he says he goes to the Father: just as the words of Jesus built upon what was given by God to Moses and to the other Old Testament prophets, the followers of Jesus, guided by the holy spirit (John 16:13), will build upon what was given by God to Jesus, and will thereby cause the world to come ever closer to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). This work being done in each of us will eventually culminate in the complete fulfillment of Jesus’ prayer of the kingdom coming and God’s will being done on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10). </p>
<p> With man it is impossible, but with God all things are possible (Matthew 19:26, Mark 10:27). We must have faith (Luke 8:25), but even more importantly we must have a love that proves our faith (1 Corinthians 13:2, James 2:18). </p>
<p> In short, I believe Jesus ate fish in order to leave room for his true followers to do more than what he explicitly asked them to do. </p>

<p> 8 thoughts on “Why did Jesus Eat Fish?” </p>
<p> This is lovely and much addresses love but lacks ANY reasonable explanation as to why God’s son would actually eat fish, dead animals that his Father created. As the Son of God we would assume and certainly hope that that would not be necessary, and he would be abstinent as a form of love, dedication and respect towards his Fathers creation. </p>
<p> The attempt to include the life after death theory for animals, as supposed hell, if God the Father doesn’t love or care for animals , lacks all reasoning or grounds. </p>
<p> Life after death, also Paradise is a different matter for all of us earthly creatures, than what we endure here on earth. He might love them enough to let them enter his Kingdom, since they have NO sin to begin with. But does he love and respect them enough to let them live out their lives in divinity, being treated by his earthly humans with respect? The answer is NO. </p>
<p> One can go much further, and certainly MUST go further, and ask why God the Father would allow animals in Asian counties to be skinned, boiled and torched alive in meat trade for human consumption. Cats and dogs. And why he would allow the Nepal Festival where drunken men slaughter every four years hundreds of thousands of animals in front of their wives and children to let a non extent Hindu God drink blood. Or why he would allow animals to be physically raped by humans, decapitated, shot, electrocuted and gassed in shelters, and why most dogs and cats in the United States die on the streets starving and being euthanized in shelters. </p>
<p> The answer is: he doesn’t care enough to have a system in place that protects these beings from the evil and deranged human soul. </p>
<p> As the ALMIGHTY he should care and respect ALL of his creatures enough to ensure that they live out their lives in dignity, love, care and respect. That is sadly not the case. </p>
<p> His son eating dead meat is certainly prove that not enough care is there to justify God’s love for his four legged creatures. </p>
<p> With all that being said, one would have hoped for a son that respects the life of those his father created that are clearly treated by God and his people as “third class citizens” on this planet and worse. </p>
<p> There is not much mentioning in the Bible of humans having to respect animals, nor are they part of the Ten Commandments. Sad reality. </p>
<p> Please be sure to research more before writing an article about such a topic. While religion wants us to believe God is Love, there is not much prove of that here on earth. Especially when talking about animals. </p>
<p> While Christian Orthodoxy prohibits eating meat during certain fasting periods prior to Christmas and Eastern, we would have hoped Christ himself goes as an example and is abstinent from meat of any kind, as a gesture of Divine respect towards his Fathers creation. </p>
<p> Excellent article, first of all! It is a unique perspective on a tough issue for Christian vegetarians. I usually answer it by first professing I don’t believe in Biblical inerrancy. Otherwise we have conflicting messages about animals in the Bible. God loves them, but permits his perfect son to eat them. He doesn’t want sacrifices, no wait he does. These things are much better explained by realizing that the Bible wasn’t written in a vacuum and that different people wrote different parts for different reasons. </p>
<p> This said, a Gospel written 3rd hand (Luke was Paul’s companion and didn’t seem to know any of the other Apostles first hand), I highly doubt he made a stringent record of what Jesus ate. For all we know (assuming the eating fish wasn’t a later insertion as has been posited) what Jesus actually ate after his resurrection was never mentioned. Luke just figured his Apostles used to be fishermen, they must have given him fish. Did he ever actually ask any of them? I doubt he specifically asked what Jesus ate after his resurrection. Especially, also, when Luke’s account of Jesus’s post-resurrection appearances conflict with those of the other Gospels. There is a good outline of this on all-creatures.org. </p>
<p> So Gary, please do not lose heart. God does indeed care about all animals. I think part of the reason pandemics like COVID exist is retribution for our abuse of animals. I highly suspect Jesus never ate animals. There are many scholarly sources that suggest this. </p>
<p> Enjoyed the article and comments posted. The one question I have is if God wants us to I appreciate and think of animals like humans than why did he prefer Abel’s sacrifice of a lamb over Cains farm goods? One the main purposes of Shepherd is to protect animals in order to be used later by humans. </p>
<p> It would seem if that what his teachings were than God would of prefer Cains grains and use of plants over Abel’s heard animal. </p>
<p> Romans 14:2, NIV: “One person’s faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables.” </p>
<p> Mark 7:15-19 “There is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man. [” If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”] When he had left the crowd and entered the house, His disciples questioned Him about the parable. And He said to them, “Are you so lacking in understanding also? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him, because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is eliminated?” (Thus He declared all foods clean.) NASB </p>
<p> 1 Timothy 4:1-5 “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.” KJV </p>

<p> Why do Catholics eat fish on Friday? </p>
<p> The Lent tradition is to abstain from meat, not necessarily to eat fish. Eating vegetables suffices. </p>
<p> Christians have fasted (gone without food) and abstained (gone without certain foods, especially meat) since the beginning. The Book of Genesis teaches that all the plants and animals that God created and entrusted to human beings are good, especially those given to us as food (Genesis 1:29). Jesus taught that nothing that a person eats makes him or her evil (Mark 7:18). So why then do Christians fast and abstain? </p>
<p> When the devil tempts Jesus in the desert with a comfortable life and a full stomach, Jesus recalls the wisdom of Deuteronomy: “One does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God” (8:3). Fasting and abstaining makes this real. It also hones our appetite, training us for the basic stance of a baptized person in this world: gratitude. Doesn’t something taste better once you’ve truly hungered for it? Aren’t we more grateful for what we’ve hungered and thirsted for? </p>
<p> Jesus recommended fasting, but not as a mere formality—and certainly not as a burden to be imposed on the poor who have to eat when they can, even if in violation of religious tradition. Instead Jesus recommended fasting when one fails to sense that God is near. </p>
<p> What then is the significance of abstaining from meat? And why eat fish? The tradition suggests a number of reasons. Some say that forgoing meat was forgoing a luxury, as meat was relatively rare for most people. This certainly would have been true in the ancient Mediterranean world in late winter—our time of Lent. Today this hardly seems true, since seafood is the luxury and hamburger costs pennies. And besides, the tradition is to abstain from meat, not necessarily to eat fish. Eating vegetables suffices. </p>
<p> The practice of eating fish is related to the day we typically abstain from meat: Friday. This is the day that Christ died, so abstaining from the shedding (and consuming) of blood seems appropriate. Friday, the sixth day, was also the day that God created animals, so abstaining from meat is a symbolic “stay of execution” for cows, pigs, and sheep—just as the cross saves us from eternal death. </p>

<p> The Hebrew scriptures also tell of Leviathan, a primordial gigantic enigmatic sea-creature (think Jonah’s whale) that represents death. So carving up and eating Leviathan on the day that Christ killed death makes great sense to the biblical imagination. Because of Christ’s victory, the great monster death is now nothing more than fish sticks on your plate! Think of that next time you skip that Friday hamburger for a tuna fish sandwich. </p>

<p> Why Do Vegetarians Eat Fish? Updated 2021 </p>
<p> Why Do vegetarians eat fish? </p>
<p> If you acknowledge a Lent in your company, then you may be familiar with the saying “No meat on Fridays, but fish is okay”. The thing I am trying to explain here is that fish is not considered as meat in various cultures. </p>
<p> For various people, fish is an underwater creature that is present in abundance, and it is not comparable to some cute-fluffy hen or a big-eyed cow. Because extinction of animals or killing them are the main reasons why someone opt for a vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> So the question is valid “Do vegetarians eat fish?”. For traditional vegetarians there is an obvious statement which they swear by. It states that they won’t eat meat of any kind including fish, no poultry, no game animal, and they also cannot eat any other aquatic life. </p>
<p> These days there are some vegetarians that eat fish too along with the floral diet. But they are not true vegetarians, there is another that is used for such a group of people and that is “Pesco-vegetarians”, or “Pesectarians”. </p>
<p> Sea food is rich in essential nutrients and vitamins which we do not find collectively in most of the food sources. It contains healthy proteins, full of healthy heart fats, and also consists of a lot of iron and a lot of Vitamin B. </p>
<p> Do vegetarians eat fish and eggs? </p>
<p> Yes! There are groups of people in the world that are vegetarians but they also eat fish. There are also those vegetarians who may not eat fish but they do consume eggs in their daily routine. </p>
<p> The vegetarians that eat eggs and other dairy items are known as “Lacto-ovo” vegetarians. However, the choice of eating eggs depends on a lot of factors like culture, religion, ethnicity and personal reasons. </p>
<p> Most nutritionists explain that consuming eggs and fish while being vegetarian is better than being a full-fledged vegetarian. Seafood and eggs provide all the nutrients that are found in chicken, mutton, and beef and other types of meat. So they not only satisfy the taste buds but they also complete the nutritional requirement of a person. </p>
<p> Why do some vegetarians eat fish? </p>
<p> Vegetarians eat fish because of the nutritional factors mainly, seafood provides healthy fatty acids like Omega-3, that is an excellent thing for people who are suffering with heart disease. </p>
<p> Eggs are one of those foods that are classified as “superfoods”. They are loaded with nutrients, which modern foods usually lack. There are some amazing health factors that even make vegetarians eat fish or eggs. They are incredibly nutritious, containing components like Vitamin A, B5, B12, Folate, Selenium, Phosphorus, Rich fatty acids, and Omega 3. </p>
<p> Another important aspect that makes vegetarians add fish in their normal diet is that it provides more variety and the food does not remain boring all the time. </p>
<p> Why do vegetarians eat fish but not meat? </p>
<p> Most of the vegetarians do not see fish meat as the proper meat. By definition, strict vegetarians do not consume any kind of poultry, meat and eggs. But fish is an exception. </p>
<p> The pescatarians believe that fish for them holds a place below meat but above bugs, and they also hold this stance that fishes are abundant animals as more than 3rd part of the Earth is covered in water. </p>
<p> So, there is not any chance of their extinction. Despite these reasons, they also want to bring more variety on the table instead of the boring lettuce and broccoli. </p>
<p> Moreover, many vegetarians also consume fish in their diet to supplement their nutritional requirements which a floral diet alone cannot fulfil. As we all know fish is jam packed with several essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. It provides healthy proteins, healthy heart fatty acids, and Omega 3 which is found in abundance in fish oil. </p>
<p> Do vegetarians eat chicken and fish? </p>
<p> Different people follow different trends and patterns of vegetarian diet. However, a true vegetarian swears by to not eat any kind of poultry, eggs, chicken or any kind of meat. </p>
<p> However, there are certain groups of vegetarians that do not follow this strict vegetarian diet. The people who consume only fish and do not eat any other meat are called “”Pesectarians”, while those who consume dairy products and eggs along with fish are known as “Lacto-ovo Vegetarians.” </p>
<p> Some people follow a strict vegan diet which can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, nutritionists always advise people to follow a moderate manner. </p>
<p> Do vegetarians eat fish and seafood? </p>
<p> Yes! Pesetarain vegetarians eat fish and other seafood diets. Vegetarians do so because in that way they can bring versatility to their diet and can also fulfil their nutritional deficiencies. </p>
<p> Fish is loaded with nutrients and if one does not eat other types of meat, eating fish is definitely a better and brilliant resource. Along with other nutrients and minerals fish provide Vitamin B12 and Zinc which are crucially essential for your immune and nervous system. </p>
<p> For instance if you eat a single oyster per day it fulfils 85% of your daily requirement of zinc and also fulfils 78% daily DV requirement. </p>
<p> Do vegetarians eat fish and shrimp? </p>
<p> Strict vegetarians do not eat any kind of meat including fish, crustaceans, or any shellfish. So, if you invite your vegetarian friends for dinner do not serve any chicken or fish meat unless you ask them if they are okay with it. </p>
<p> It is a simple fact that fishes live in water. Fish and any other meat diet is not for true vegetarians. However, pescetarians opt fish in their diet along with the vegetarian diet. </p>
<p> Being a vegetarian is a choice, and any true vegetarian does not eat any kind of fish, shrimp, lobster, or shellfish or any other seafood. Being vegetarian depends upon several factors like ethnicity, religion, cultural norms. </p>
<p> Do vegans or vegetarians eat fish? </p>
<p> As you know being a vegetarian is totally up to you, though you can eat whatever you want from chicken burger to potato fries. But when you say you are a vegetarian or vegan then you do not consume any type of dairy, poultry or meat diet. </p>
<p> There are several reasons for being a vegetarian, most of the people do it for animal welfare, betterment of the environment, saving animals from getting extinct, and to also decrease global warming. </p>
<p> However, some vegetarians simply just do not want to consume any kind of meat either chicken or fish, and when they make up their mind, they do the same for major portions in their lives. </p>
<p> Do some vegetarians eat fish? </p>
<p> Fish and other meat is not included in a vegetarian diet. However, there are some group of people that do consume fish, eggs and dairy products in their daily diet. </p>
<p> These people are known as “pescetarians”. The diet of these people contain major portions of plant diet and they also consume fish and seafood along with the plant diet. </p>
<p> People who follow a pescetarian diet do so to have more variety in their diet and they are also inspired by the nutritional benefits of marine diet. </p>
<p> Do vegetarians eat fish and chicken? </p>
<p> There are also some vegetarians that consume chicken along with fish in their daily diet. Such groups of people are known as ” Pollotarians”. There are several reasons for choosing this pattern of diet. For the majority being a Pollotarian, is considered as the first step towards a vegan diet. </p>
<p> However, some people may opt for this diet because of the environmental and health effects of consuming red meat. </p>
<p> Pollotarian diet is a a semi-vegetarian diet, in which some forms of animal meat are allowed and other animal products are prohibited. The word “pollo” means “Chicken” in Spanish, Pollotarians eat all kinds of poultry that include turkey and ducks as well. </p>
<p> People following this diet do not consume red meat or any pork products. However some may include eggs or dairy diet in their routine while others won’t. </p>
<p> Do vegetarians eat tuna fish? </p>
<p> Pesetarians eat fish along with their vegan diet to fulfil their nutritional requirements and also to bring colors on their table. People eat different kinds of fishes mainly for their health benefits. Vegetarians also believe that fish is an abundant animal present on the Earth which does not face dangers of extinction. </p>
<p> That is also one of the reasons why vegetarians shift to a Pesetarians diet. </p>
<p> Do any vegetarians eat fish? </p>
<p> Yes some vegetarians do eat fish and they are known as “Pesetarians”. Though a true vegetarian diet does not include any kind of poultry or meat. However, choosing either kind of diet is a personal option. </p>
<p> Fishes are a treasure of vitamins, protein and several other essential nutrients. Therefore, most of the vegetarians do so by adding fish to their diet so that they can be healthy and active. </p>

<p> Why do we eat fish on Good Friday? </p>
<p> EASTER comes around every spring and brings with it a number of traditions. </p>
<p> While thousands of chocolate eggs and rabbits get scoffed over the bank holiday weekend, another thing that many eat is fish on Good Friday. But why? </p>
<p> Why do we eat fish on Good Friday? </p>
<p> Christians believe that Jesus was crucified on Good Friday, sacrificing his flesh for our sins. </p>
<p> For centuries, those who follow the religion have abstained from eating meat on the day. </p>
<p> Meat was seen as a delicacy in ancient cultures, and was generally linked with celebrations and feasts. </p>
<p> So instead, Christians choose to eat fish on Good Friday. </p>
<p> The rule of not eating meat does not extend to fish, as the Church order states "land animals". </p>
<p> Fish shapes were also used a secret symbol by Christians to identify each other when their religion was temporarily banned, and many of Jesus' followers were fishermen. </p>
<p> What happened on Good Friday? </p>
<p> Easter is a Christian tradition that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus and marks the end of Lent. </p>
<p> Those who follow the Bible believe that Christ was crucified at Calvary on Good Friday. </p>
<p> Accounts of the Gospel state that the son of God was betrayed by Judas, before he was sentenced to death. </p>
<p> Christians believe Jesus sacrificed himself to save mankind from sin. </p>
<p> After the crucifixion, the scriptures say that Jesus’ body was taken from the cross and placed in a tomb guarded by Roman soldiers. </p>
<p> When does Lent end? </p>
<p> Lent began on Ash Wednesday – which in 2021 was February 17. </p>
<p> Its exact date changes each year because it is determined by when Easter is. </p>
<p> Easter falls on the first Sunday following the first full moon after the vernal equinox. </p>
<p> Ash Wednesday is always the day after Shrove Tuesday, or Pancake Day. </p>
<p> Lent lasts 40 days with the Sundays seen as celebrations and not counted. </p>
<p> It officially ends on Maundy Thursday, which in 2021 is April 1. </p>
<p> Maundy Thursday marks Jesus Christ’s last supper and the initiation of the Eucharist. </p>
<p> It was a tradition for the monarch in England to wash the feet of the poor and kiss them on Maundy Thursday. </p>
<p> Nowadays the monarch hands out Maundy Money on the day. </p>
<p> Despite its significance in the Christian calendar it is not a bank holiday. </p>
<p> We test Easter eggs from supermarkets including Aldi, Tesco and M&S to see which ones are best </p>

<p> Why you CAN eat food after it's been dropped on the floor: Doctor busts the five-second rule myth (and reveals the kitchen counter is much dirtier) </p>
<p> Indiana professor Aaron Carroll says he eats food that's been on the floor </p>
<p> He says kitchen counter is 'dirtier' but we don't worry if food has touched it </p>
<p> Agrees with recent study that says food can pick up bacteria immediately </p>
<p> But explians we shouldn't be concerned as our immune systems are hardy </p>
<p> Do you follow the five-second rule - the guideline that says it's okay to eat food from the floor if you pick it up straight away? </p>
<p> If so, then you may welcome the advice of one doctor, who says we shouldn't be remotely worried about eating anything that's been on the floor - no matter how long it's been there. </p>
<p> Aaron E Carroll, Indiana University's professor of pediatrics, says he eats food that's been on the floor - rejecting the advice of a recent study that suggests food dropped on the floor will pick up any bacteria in just one second, rather than five. </p>
<p> Indiana university professor Dr Aaron E Carroll says we shouldn't be too worried about dropping food on the floor - as other household surfaces are much dirtier </p>
<p> Dr Carroll told the New York Times that we should instead be more concerned with how much bacteria is on other household surfaces compared to the floor. </p>
<p> He says there are far dirtier places in a typical house than the floor - such as the handle of a fridge, the kitchen sink and the kitchen counter, highlighting several studies that back up his claims. </p>
<p> And while he acknowledges that food does pick up bacteria as soon as it's come into contact with it, he says food could be contaminated just as easily as the floor by touching other household items before handling food. </p>

<p> But before you reach for the bleach and anti-bacterial wipes in a panic, the professor says this revelation is no cause for alarm. </p>
<p> Dr Carroll wrote: 'People react to news like this in one of two ways. </p>
<p> 'One is to become paranoid about everything...The alternative is to realize that for most of us, our immune systems are pretty hardy. </p>
<p> 'We've all been touching this dirty stuff for a long time, without knowing it, and doing just fine.' </p>
<p> To back up his point, he pointed to a study by Charles Gerba, a professor of microbiology and environmental sciences at the University of Arizona. </p>
<p> Relax if you've dropped food on the floor and eaten it - Dr Carroll says our immune systems are hardy enough to cope with any bacteria picked up from the ground </p>
<p> In 1998, he and a team of researchers ran tests to see how dirty common household surfaces and items were. </p>
<p> While the kitchen floor harboured, on average, about three colonies of coliform bacteria, the fridge handle had just over five colonies per square inch, while the kitchen counter had even more at 5.75 colonies per square inch. </p>
<p> So while the floor does harbour bacteria, we should probably be more worried about food touching our disgusting kitchen counters before eating it, he says. </p>
<p> Dr Carroll says the same principle applies to the bathroom. </p>
<p> Most people believe the toilet seat is the dirtiest surface in the bathroom. </p>
<p> But the same study found that it only harboured 0.68 colonies per square inch on average, while the the flush handle had a disgusting 34.65 colonies per square inch, with the tap on the sink harbouring 15.84 colonies per square inch. </p>
<p> Dr Carroll says the best way to ensure you don't get ill from these bacteria is to simply wash your hands before eating food. </p>
<p> He wrote: 'If I drop food on the floor, I still eat it. </p>
<p> 'I do that because the harm I might get from the floor is not worth my concern compared with many, many other things. You may feel differently. </p>
<p> 'Either way, make an informed judgment based on relative risks, not on any arbitrary span of time that one thing has been touching another.' </p>

<p> Why you should EAT water, not drink it - If you're obsessed with rehydrating, drop that bottle and reach for the fruit and veg </p>
<p> Experts believe we should turn off the tap and start eating our water </p>
<p> Doctor says that healthy hydration is about the water you hold in the body, not the water you drink that passes straight through </p>
<p> Fruit and veg can hydrate the body twice as effectively as a glass of water </p>
<p> We are always being told that we don’t drink enough water - the recommended amount is two litres, or eight large glasses, a day - which has led many women to try to dramatically increase their consumption. </p>
<p> Indeed, a lot of people today seem to be ‘aquaholics’, rarely separated from their bulging plastic bottles as they sip, slurp and glug their way through the day. </p>
<p> But now it seems they could be wasting their time. </p>
<p> The ‘drink more water’ health message might have been somewhat over-played. In an average day, a quarter of our liquid comes from our food. Almost all food has some water in it (even a slice of bread can be as much as 33 per cent H2O), but fruit and vegetables are the most water-laden (stock image) </p>
<p> That’s because experts believe we should all turn off the tap and start eating our water instead. </p>
<p> It is clear our bodies need water to function - anything from 1½ litres to three litres a day depending on body size and exertion. </p>
<p> It is essential for keeping moist delicate tissues (such as those in the mouth, eyes and nose), it lubricates joints, carries nutrients around the body, regulates body temperature and digestion, and helps flush out toxins and waste products. </p>
<p> Many beauty experts also say that getting plenty of water is the secret to plump, glowing skin - particularly in middle age. </p>
<p> It is clear our bodies need water to function - anything from 1½ litres to three litres a day depending on body size and exertion. It is essential for keeping moist delicate tissues (such as those in the mouth, eyes and nose) </p>
<p> This is because while we’re made up of 75 to 80 per cent water at birth, the cells throughout our body gradually dry up with age, and by the time we reach 50 we are closer to 50 per cent water. </p>
<p> However, the ‘drink more water’ health message might have been somewhat over-played. </p>
<p> In an average day, a quarter of our liquid comes from our food. Almost all food has some water in it (even a slice of bread can be as much as 33 per cent H2O), but fruit and vegetables are the most water-laden, with cucumbers, lettuce, courgettes and radishes boasting more than 95 per cent. </p>
<p> Now health enthusiasts are arguing we should be eating more of these water-rich foods and drinking less. </p>
<p> ‘Healthy hydration is about the water you hold in the body, not the water you drink that passes straight through,’ says Dr Howard Murad, associate clinic professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of The Water Secret. </p>
<p> A tomato contains 109ml of water and a portion of Iceberg lettuce contains 300ml. The water you eat is different to the water you drink because the water in food is surrounded by other molecules that help it get into our cells more easily, and ensure it stays in our system for long enough to be put to good use (stock image) </p>
<p> Drinking too much water can, he says, actually deplete your body of vitamins and minerals if they are flushed out of the body too quickly. </p>
<p> ‘There’s nothing wrong with drinking water, but if we don’t improve the capacity to get it into our cells and keep it there, it goes straight into the toilet without doing us any good,’ he says. </p>
<p> ‘You can drink eight glasses of water - and while that is still a way of putting water into your body, it could mean eight trips to the bathroom without it actually reaching your cells.’ </p>
<p> He warns that puffy eyes, swollen ankles and a bloated stomach are signs of a body that is not handling water efficiently. </p>
<p> ‘It floats between our cells, ageing us and making us feel fat and sluggish.’ </p>
<p> Many beauty experts also say that getting plenty of water is the secret to plump, glowing skin - particularly in middle age. This is because while we’re made up of 75 to 80 per cent water at birth, the cells throughout our body gradually dry up with age, and by the time we reach 50 we are closer to 50 per cent water (stock image) </p>
<p> However, the water you eat is different. This is because the water in food is surrounded by other molecules that help it get into our cells more easily, and ensure it stays in our system for long enough to be put to good use. </p>
<p> ‘When we eat water-rich foods, we absorb water more slowly because it is trapped in the structure of these foods,’ says Dr Murad. ‘That slow absorption means the water in food stays in our bodies longer, and brings a multitude of additional benefits.’ </p>
<p> In fact, studies show that fruit and vegetables can hydrate the body twice as effectively as a glass of water. </p>
<p> One study, by researchers at the University of Aberdeen Medical School, found that the natural sugars, proteins, mineral salts and vitamins in water-rich fruits and vegetables means they also supplement the nutrients lost through exercise. Dr Murad calls this type of hydration ‘structured water’. </p>
<p> A cucumber contains 100ml of water in it. ‘Foods with a high water content tend to be low calorie,’ says dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker, explaining that substituting water-based foods for high-calorie foods is one clever way to subtract calories and fat from your diet (stock image) </p>
<p> So an entire cucumber (which weighs 100g and is 96 per cent water) might deliver only just under 100 ml of liquid (just over a quarter of a pint). </p>
<p> However, by ‘drinking’ your water in cucumber form, you’ll get 100ml of liquid that your body can really use, and you’ll be stocking up on fibre and plant nutrients at the same time. </p>
<p> As a further bonus, if you set out to eat as much water as you can and opt for a variety of plant sources, you’ll be massively increasing your consumption of fruit and vegetables beyond the minimum five portions a day recommended by cancer experts to protect you against disease. </p>
<p> You might also lose weight. </p>
<p> Healthy hydration is about the water you hold in the body, not the water you drink that passes straight through </p>
<p> ‘Foods with a high water content tend to be low calorie,’ says dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker, explaining that substituting water-based foods for high-calorie foods is one clever way to subtract calories and fat from your diet. Furthermore, studies show that watery foods keep you feeling fuller for longer. </p>
<p> ‘The water content aids the digestive process, which keeps you sated,’ says Dr Schenker. ‘Water-rich foods can help bulk up your diet while delivering nutrients and water.’ </p>
<p> She recommends putting the consumption of water-filled vegetables before fruit, as eating too much fruit can push your blood sugar levels up. </p>
<p> She also advises eating them raw or only lightly cooked. </p>
<p> This is because the cooking process breaks down the cell membranes of plants and allows water to leak out, depleting your potential water supply and leaching precious nutrients, too. </p>
<p> But before you throw away your water filter and fill the fridge with salad instead, Dr Schenker warns that you might want to ease yourself slowly from drinking water to eating it. </p>
<p> A too swift switch could give your body an unfamiliar fibre boost, which could see you running to the lavatory for an entirely different reason... </p>

<doc id="file21599875" filename="why-i-eat-fruit-first-thing-in-the-morning" parent_folder="web2" url="http://fromscratchmostly.com/from-scratch-mostly-home-page/why-i-eat-fruit-first-thing-in-the-morning">
<p> I haven't mentioned yet that a few weeks ago I decided to start eating fruit before anything else in the morning. I basically wake up and start the day with my daily routine. While making everyone's meal I nosh on mango or a few chunks of watermelon (2 of my favorites) and head over to Selah's room for her morning routine. This totals up to about 30 minutes before I actually eat my meal, which gives me plenty of time to digest the fruit I had just eaten. </p>
<p> So why am I being so particular with fruit, you ask? </p>
<p> Well, there are countless of rumors going around the health community stating that the consumption of fruit first thing in the morning, or simply on an empty stomach, is beneficial for weight loss, cancer prevention, and the treatment of chronic illnesses! Although I may not be an RD, I have done some research on the benefits of eating fruit before anything else. Much to my dismay, I ended up with a "virtual" headache due to the myriad of contradicting information which almost had me give up on the whole idea. Thankfully that didn't happen! </p>
<p> In order to break it down for us, I will talk about the few things I have found on the internet so we can look at it collectively--then we can make a judgment call on the topic and decide whether or not we even want to follow this practice. Ultimately, I just want to share how the consumption of {certain} fruits first thing in the morning has affected me personally, because we are all suckers for real-life testimonies, aren't we? :) </p>
<p> Mixing fruit with other things cancels its benefits due to lack of nutrient absorption, therefore leading to lack of proper nutrition and vitamins. But something is still better than nothing and the only truth that this claim holds up to is the fact that some foods can make us more indigested than others. </p>
<p> Fruit on an empty stomach promotes a higher metabolism and produces a detoxifying effect. However, there isn't too much scientific proof on this claim. </p>
<p> My Experience with Eating Fruit First Thing in the Morning </p>
<p> Although my experience with this shows me that mayyyyybe the above bits of information might have some truth to them, I can't say for sure that they are 100% responsible for the changes in my body and health. This is my personal experience though, so please remember to take it in with a grain of salt, as with anything. </p>
<p> I only eat fruits that are non-acidic when I have an empty stomach, as in they don't make my intestines burn, especially due to my indigestion problems. </p>
<p> I eat a main meal shortly after because of my sensitive stomach. </p>
<p> Fruit is beneficial in any form, in my opinion, so I still mix it with my food as I please because it can't hurt. That is, unless, the fruit is extremely sour like an underripe orange or strawberry. Cant eat those! Blechhh. </p>
<p> Noticed a boost of energy and I don't feel as tired throughout the day. I still need my 3 PM java fix, though. :) </p>
<p> Easier time digesting food! </p>
<p> People have noticed that I have dropped some weight, although it's hard for me to tell personally. I can't say that it is exclusively due to this way of eating fruit (as the articles state), but I noticed that my appetite is a bit more under control. By the time I start my meal I don't feel ravenous, thus, I don't end up eating as much as usual and I feel more attuned to my body's signals. </p>
<p> Finals Thoughts to Take Home </p>
<p> I realize that this is an overwhelming amount of information, and trust me....this is nothing compared to the hundreds of articles out there! </p>
<p> My thought is this...As with anything related to dietary practices, please do what feels good for your body. While I do believe that the above statements might have some truth to them, I do not think that they can dramatically change our health or help us shed 100 lbs. Sure, they can always be beneficial and they certainly can't hurt...but if you have a hypersensitive stomach then eating sour fruit probably isn't the best idea. On the other hand, you might be lucky to be able to control your appetite a lot better if you were to eat fruit on an empty stomach. </p>
<p> So do trial and error if this is of interest to you. Don't do it just because Victoria Beckham swears by this way of eating, and don't do it just because it has benefited me. Try it out and see for yourself if it helps you thrive, or whether it makes things more complicated for you. </p>
<p> Although I hate extreme dietary practices, adding a bit of fruit before anything else in the morning has done preeettyyyy good things for me! I just treat it like regular supplements. And whether or not you try this out, do so with wisdom and discretion. I like what Michael Pollan says: "Eat Food. Not too Much. Mostly Plants (In Defense of Food)". Simple is good! </p>
<p> Cheers to health, guys! </p>
<p> Have you ever heard of these claims? What are your thoughts on them? </p>
<p> Do you eat strategically? </p>
<p> What are some "different" ways of eating that have helped you in the long run? </p>

<p> Feeding your children is our ‘bread and butter’ </p>
<p> There’s everything in place for a safe return to school, from special training to a ‘grab and go’ menu. </p>
<p> What we do </p>
<p> Serving meals with the right nutritional balance boosts children’s development, behaviour and ability to learn. Our eats development chef creates two exciting menus per academic term, taking into account freshness, seasonality of ingredients, tastes, and trends. Reducing sugar and fat is a priority, as is ensuring ingredients are ethically sourced from local suppliers with the highest standards. Increasing fruit and vegetable intake is another commitment, and we often use natural sweetness (eg from parsnips and beetroots) in our delicious desserts. We have been nationally recognised at the Cost Sector Catering Awards with short listings in the Innovation and Education categories for our ‘Pick & Mix’ offer, allowing children to create a bag or box suiting their individual tastes. </p>
<p> How we do it </p>
<p> Highly experienced </p>
<p> Our catering management team bring over 100 years worth of experience to eats. Meet us and you’ll experience our passion for school meals first hand. </p>
<p> Home baked </p>
<p> The majority of meals are freshly prepared in our kitchens. Visit our kitchens to experience the aroma of homemade bread and pizza bases made with flour from a family-owned local producer. </p>
<p> Healthy meals </p>
<p> All of our menus follow the School Food Standards and are made with the healthiest ingredients. Sample our food to see how we cut sugar and saturated fat without compromising any taste or enjoyment. </p>
<p> Why choose Eats? </p>
<p> Sustainable </p>
<p> Through reduced packaging, spot-on portion sizes, local procurement, and initiatives such as converting used cooking oil into biodiesel, we reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. </p>
<p> Consistent </p>
<p> We have an award-winning team of brand champions who work hard to ensure our unashamedly high standards are met every day, throughout all our schools. </p>
<p> Integrity </p>
<p> We deliver on our promises. We will work with you to build your bespoke catering package for your school and if we say we can do it, we will get it done. </p>
<p> Partnership </p>
<p> Our curriculum-enriched theme days and events tie in with your school’s calendar. We become part of your learning environment, supporting with parents evenings, sports days and hosting school barbecues. </p>
<p> Agility </p>
<p> Our success is built upon offering the flexibility to make changes within our kitchens as and when you need it, quickly with the minimum of fuss. </p>
<p> Our food </p>
<p> Our award-winning development chef works to the School Food Standards and Food for Life guidelines to hand-craft menus that are nutritious and tasty. Our experienced, dedicated catering teams then prepare and cook these meals knowing that your children will love them. </p>
<p> Here at eats, we are proud to have pledged our commitment to the Peas Please initiative. We have pledged to develop our menus to ensure that a minimum of six varieties of vegetables and salads are available each week in children’s meal experiences. </p>
<p> OUR MENUS </p>
<p> WHAT OUR LOVELY CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING </p>
<p> We have been delighted with the service provided by Vertas to date. </p>
<p> The children are raving about the increased range of choice and quality of food provided each day and comment that the staff are always really smiley! Vertas definitely offered a ‘can do’ solution to our catering requirements. </p>
<p> Headteacher at Barnabas Oley Primary School, Cambridgeshire </p>
<p> We are excited to be working in partnership with Vertas. </p>
<p> They share the same values as we do and are committed to creating fresh, healthy and innovative food to support the health and well-being of our children. We chose Vertas as they listened to the children and worked to meet the school’s needs; positively encouraging us to visit other schools they provide for. The difference in the quality of the food and the eating environment was immediate. </p>
<p> Headteacher at Mile Cross Primary, Norfolk </p>
<p> Vertas has worked closely with us and our pupils to support our dining experience. </p>
<p> We are delighted with the increase in meal uptake with both our staff and pupils, encouraging healthy eating. </p>

<p> Ate my first meal tonight. I had the orecchiette pasta with broccoli rabe, prosciutto and farm eggs.... So easy to make and this is something I would never be able to cook myself. It was delicious and a generous portion, so I will bring the rest of it to work for lunch tomorrow. </p>

<p> Best Fruits to Eat If You Have Diabetes </p>
<p> Tips for Incorporating Fruit Into Your Meal Plan </p>
<p> Barbie Cervoni MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, is a registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist. </p>
<p> Ana Maria Kausel, MD, is double board-certified in internal medicine and endocrinology/diabetes and metabolism. She works in private practice and is affiliated with Mount Sinai St. Luke's/Mount Sinai West. </p>
<p> You may have heard at some point that you cannot eat fruit if you have diabetes. Perhaps someone even told you that watermelon and bananas are off limits because they are too sweet. Neither of these is entirely true. You can enjoy fruit, you simply need to make smart decisions about which fruits and how much you eat. </p>
<p> Fruits and Diabetes </p>
<p> Fruits have many health benefits—they contain vitamins, minerals, filling fiber and antioxidants. Fruit can be beneficial to a diabetes meal plan if eaten in moderation. The key to eating fruit is to make sure you eat the right kinds in the appropriate portions. </p>
<p> The fiber found in fruit can help to prevent blood sugar spikes, may aid in pulling cholesterol away from your heart, and increase feelings of fullness, resulting in less food intake. Fruit is also an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, such as potassium, which can help reduce your blood pressure.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> On the flip side, fruit is a carbohydrate and it contains a natural sugar called fructose. Carbohydrates, whether from bread, milk, yogurt, potatoes, or fruit, get broken down during digestion and turn into sugar or glucose. For this reason, it's recommended that people who have diabetes monitor how many carbohydrates they eat, including fruit servings.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> When choosing fruit you'll want to take a few tips into consideration: </p>
<p> Avoid Dried Fruit and Fruit Juices </p>
<p> Dried fruit, especially if it is sweetened, is higher in carbohydrates per serving than natural whole fruit. It also contains more sugar because sugars are often added for flavor and can be lower in fiber if the skin has been removed. Just four tablespoons of raisins (1/4 cup) will cost you: 120 calories, 32 grams of carbohydrates, and 24 grams of sugar.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> It's also best to avoid all fruit juices. Even 100% fruit juice causes instant spikes in blood sugars because the flesh of the fruit, which contains fiber, is discarded. It is also easy to drink an excess amount of calories without realizing it. For example, 1 cup of 100% fruit juice contains 130 calories, 33 grams of carbohydrates, and 28 grams of sugar.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Instead of dried fruit or fruit juice, opt for whole fruit—fresh, frozen, or canned—without added syrups or sugars. </p>
<p> Keep Portions in Check </p>
<p> The American Diabetes Association recommends about 45% of total daily calorie intake come from carbohydrates.﻿﻿ If you are following a fixed, consistent carbohydrate meal plan, you need to factor in fruit as a carbohydrate choice. When choosing fruit, try to stick with one fruit serving per meal or snack and limit your fruit servings to no more than about two to three per day.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Keep in mind that one fruit serving is about 15 grams of carbohydrates. How much of each fruit you can eat within that one-serving limit will depend on the type of fruit. Here is a list of what is considered one serving for common whole fruits:﻿﻿ </p>
<p> 1 small-sized (4 ounces) apple, orange, peach, pear, or plum </p>
<p> 1 cup raspberries and blackberries (contains 8 grams of fiber) </p>
<p> There are some fruits that you should be more cautious about. For instance, it's recommended that bananas, cherries, grapes, mango, and pineapple be eaten only in the limited quantities noted, as they can cause a fast spike in blood sugars due to their higher carbohydrate content. </p>
<p> If you are looking to get the most value for the biggest portion, you will want to choose fruits that are very high in fiber, such as berries. For example, you can eat 1 1/4 cup of strawberries for 15 grams carbohydrates.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Choose Fruits With a Lower Glycemic Index </p>
<p> The American Diabetes Association suggests that you choose fruits that have a low glycemic index.﻿﻿ The glycemic index, or GI, is used as a reference to measure how a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose. </p>
<p> Foods are rated based on how they raise blood sugars in comparison to a reference food such as sugar or white bread. A food with a high GI will raise blood glucose more than that of a food with a medium or low GI.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Most fruits have a low to moderate GI, with the exception of pineapple and watermelon.﻿﻿ That doesn't mean you can never eat pineapple and watermelon, but if you notice that your blood sugar spikes after eating either, it's best to avoid them in the future. It's also important to note that the GI of a food is different when eaten alone than it is when combined with other foods. For example, if you are eating a high GI fruit, such as watermelon, pairing it with a low GI index food, such as low-fat cheese can help to balance out the effect on blood sugar levels. Here are some examples of low, moderate, and high GI fruits: </p>
<p> Low GI fruits (55 or less): apples, pears, mango, blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, grapefruit, pear, nectarine, orange </p>
<p> High GI fruits (70 or greater): watermelon, pineapple </p>
<p> Note this information, while also keeping in mind that everyone has their own trigger foods which will spike blood sugars more than others. Additionally, the riper a fruit is, the more it affects your blood sugar. </p>
<p> Lastly, consider this: some nutritious foods have a higher GI than foods with little nutritional value. For example, oatmeal has a higher GI than chocolate. When using the GI, balance it with basic nutrition principals and eat a variety of healthy foods and less of foods with few nutrients. </p>
<p> Pair it With Protein </p>
<p> Some people find that pairing fruit with a protein can help slow down a rise in the blood sugars.﻿﻿ You can do this by incorporating fruit into your meal allotment for carbohydrates or add protein to your fruit snack. </p>
<p> For example: </p>
<p> 1 4-ounce apple slice with 1 tablespoon almond butter </p>
<p> 1 cup raspberries with 1 small non-fat Greek yogurt </p>
<p> 1 small peach with 1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese </p>
<p> Get the Most Out of Your Fruit Choices </p>
<p> When choosing fruit, you'll want to think about portion size, convenience, cost, and flavor, but also health benefits. Certain types of fruit, such as berries and citrus fruits, can be beneficial for people with diabetes. </p>
<p> Berries are rich in vitamin C, folic acid, fiber, and disease-fighting phytochemicals. Vitamin C is an important water-soluble vitamin that is involved in repairing cells (particularly important for wound healing), slowing down aging, and boosting immunity.﻿﻿ Additionally their rich color—red, blue, and black comes from anthocyanins. Research suggests that anthocyanins may help fend off certain chronic disease, including cardiovascular disease.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Citrus fruits, such as tangerines, also contain vitamin C, and potassium (which can reduce blood pressure) and are a good source of fat soluble vitamin A, an important vitamin for eye health. Citrus fruits, also contain phytonutrients which can protect cells from damage, reduce inflammation, lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, and provide other health benefits.﻿﻿ But, if you are on a potassium restricted diet or take cholesterol-lowering medication you may have to watch your intake of citrus fruits so make sure you discuss intake with your physician before adding them to your meal plan. </p>
<p> A Word From Verywell </p>
<p> The notion that you have to avoid fruit on a diabetic diet is a myth. However, it is important that you make the best choices and always consider the carbohydrates in fruits, which will convert to sugar and may cause a spike in your blood sugar. Choose wisely and keep your portions under control and you should be able to enjoy some fruits. If you have questions, be sure to ask a member of your healthcare team. </p>

<p> Growing up with a Chinese mother and a Jewish father, I was exposed to a range of practices and beliefs that varied in their levels of hilarity and veracity. One custom from the Chinese side stated that at mealtime, in the event that a whole fish—head and tail on for good luck and fortune—was on the table, the most honorable guest received the eyeballs to eat. Thanks to my voracious appetite and my sister's total disinterest in munching on slimy fish eyes, that honor was bestowed upon me. (I still felt special, even if I won by default.) </p>

<p> After scooping the eye from the socket of whichever unlucky mackerel or sea bass that landed on our table, I'd hold it in my mouth and savor the gooey outer layer before biting into the crispy, wafer-like center, letting the rich umami flavor of the ocean floor dance across my tongue. Slurp, yum. Hungry yet? </p>
<p> I know how it sounds. Outside the home, I was embarrassed to admit to my classmates or friends that I ate eyeballs—I thought they might see it as gross or barbaric. The eyes are part of the face, which cradles the brain, the ultimate provider of identity; eyes are the windows into the soul. I figured people would squirm at the prospect of consuming something that reminded them of being human. </p>
<p> But my days of hiding the unconventional stuff I eat are over, and I urge you to give eyeballs a hearty go. </p>
<p> Beyond the best reason to eat fish eyes—they're delicious—Chinese folks swear by their nutritional advantages as well. The eyeball is said to stimulate brain cells and stave off memory loss, courtesy of a pair of unsaturated fatty acids called DHA and EPA. My mom, of course, fully bought into this theory: "Eat the eye and you'll be smart!" Additionally, the head itself (another part you should eat) is chock full of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and protein. </p>
<p> The Chinese aren’t the only ones throwing back eyeballs. Russians use fish heads—peepers and all—in a soup called ukha. In Iceland, they serve a traditional dish called svio, or boiled sheep’s head, and every appendage must be consumed by the end of the meal. Any Sri Lankan will tell you it’s customary to eat the entire fish to avoid waste, and yes, that includes the eyes. </p>
<p> Maybe they'll make you smarter. You'll likely feel a little more cultured. But you'll definitely stimulate your tastebuds with saline flavor like you’ve never experienced before. So the next time you’re presented with a whole fish, tell the plebs sitting around you to fall back, because you’re the honorable guest, and this eye’s for you. </p>
