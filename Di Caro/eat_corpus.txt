<p> Leviticus 11:1-17 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, … </p>

<p> Deuteronomy 14:1-29 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead… </p>
<p> (14) Not so, Lord . . .--The emphatic resistance even to a voice from heaven is strikingly in harmony with the features of St. Peter's character, as portrayed in the Gospels, with the "Be it far from thee, Lord," when he heard of the coming Passion (Matthew 16:22), with "Thou shalt never wash my feet," in John 13:8. He had been taught that that which "goeth into the mouth cannot defile the man" (Mark 7:15), but he had not taken in that truth in its fulness, either in its literal or symbolic meaning. </p>
<p> Any thing that is common or unclean.--"Common" is used, as in Mark 7:2, in the sense of "defiled" or "impure," that which excludes the idea of consecration to a special service. </p>
<p> Verse 14. - And unclean for or unclean, A.V. and T.R. It is rather a striking testimony to Peter's religious character as a Jew before his call to the apostolate, that, poor Galilaean fisherman as he was, unlearned and ignorant, he had yet always conscientiously obeyed the Law of Moses in regard to things clean and unclean (comp. Daniel 1:8-15). The address, Lord (Κύριε), seems certainly to recognize the voice as that of Christ, which also agrees with the descent of the vessel from heaven. The answer is very similar to the refusals in Matthew 16:22; John 13:8. </p>

<p> The most common reason for a tingling mouth after eating is a food allergy. </p>
<p> Image Credit: yourstockbank/iStock/GettyImages </p>
<p> Many people enjoy the tingling and burning sensations in your mouth triggered by eating spicy dishes with a lot of heat. On the other hand, uncomfortable oral burning and tingling not due spicy food often signals an underlying medical or dental problem. Possible culprits include allergies, nutritional deficiencies and diseased or broken teeth, among others. </p>
<p> Oral Allergy Syndrome </p>
<p> People with hay fever — an allergy to pollen from plants or trees — sometimes experience an oral reaction to certain fruits and/or vegetables, especially if eaten raw. This special type of food allergy called oral allergy syndrome (OAS) or pollen-food allergy syndrome typically causes burning and tingling of the mouth, tongue and possibly the lips and throat after eating a triggering food. These symptoms occur because the immune system confuses some of the proteins in the offending foods with plant pollens that provoke hay fever symptoms. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The foods that cause OAS differ from one person to another based on the specific types of pollens to which you are allergic. For example, people who are allergic to birch pollen commonly experience OAS symptoms after eating apples, pears and pitted fruits like cherries, apricots and plums, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. In contrast, those with a ragweed allergy often experience OAS symptoms after consuming melons, bananas, zucchini, cucumbers or chamomile tea. </p>
<p> True Food Allergy </p>
<p> Whereas an underlying pollen allergy is responsible for the symptoms of OAS, mouth burning and tingling along with other symptoms can also occur in people with a "true" food allergy — meaning an allergy specifically to the proteins found in certain foods. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, the foods most likely to trigger a food allergy include cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy and wheat. </p>
<p> Swelling beneath the skin surface called angioedema, especially around the eyes and lips </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> A food allergy sometimes triggers a severe reaction called anaphylaxis, characterized by throat tightness, wheezing, difficulty breathing and dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical care. </p>
<p> Other Causes </p>
<p> Irritation of your mouth and/or tongue tissues can cause sensitivity to hot, spicy, sour or acidic foods leading to mouth burning or tingling. Many conditions can potentialy lead to mouth irritation, including: </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Recurring canker sores, also known as aphthous ulcers </p>
<p> Diagnosis </p>
<p> Seeing your primary care doctor is usually the best way to start an evaluation if you experience burning or tingling in your mouth triggered by eating or drinking. In some cases, seeing your dentist first makes more sense if you suspect your symptoms might be caused by a dental problem. </p>
<p> After performing a physical examination and collecting information about symptom triggers and the frequency and duration of your symptoms, your doctor might order some blood tests. You might also get a referral to an allergist for testing if your doctor suspects a food allergy or oral allergy syndrome. </p>
<p> Treatment </p>
<p> Treatment for oral burning and tingling after eating depends on the cause. With OAS, the primary treatment involves avoidance of the offending food(s). Some people can tolerate triggering foods if they've been cooked because the heat often breaks down the food proteins that lead to an oral reaction. Scrupulous avoidance of the food(s) to which you are allergic is typically the cornerstone of treatment for a true food allergy. </p>
<p> Treatments for other causes of oral burning or tingling might include one or more of the following: </p>
<p> Dental treatment </p>
<p> Medicinal mouth rinses </p>
<p> Vitamin or mineral supplements </p>
<p> Medication to treat an underlying medical disorder, such as Crohn disease </p>
<p> Warning </p>
<p> Call 911 immediately if you experience any signs or symptoms that might signal an anaphylactic reaction, including difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, throat or chest tightness, and dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting. </p>

<p> Psalm 119:97,103 MEM. O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day… </p>
<p> (3) It was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.--That is, the first impression made upon him by his prophetic call was one of delight. Such it must always be to those whose high privilege it is to bear God's message to their fellows. He does not expressly add, as St. John does (Revelation 10:10) after a similar first sensation, "as soon as I had eaten it my belly was "bitter;" but it may easily be inferred from Ezekiel 3:14 that such was his experience also, when he went with his heavy message to a people indisposed to give ear. (Comp. Jeremiah 15:16; Jeremiah 20:7-18.) </p>
<p> Verse 3. - It was in my mouth as honey, etc. The words remind us of Psalm 19:10; Proverbs 24:13; and again of those of Jeremiah in the darkest hour of his ministry (Jeremiah 15:16). They are reproduced yet more closely by St. John (Revelation 10:9). There is, after the first terror is over, an infinite sweetness in the thought of being a fellow worker with God, of speaking his words and not our own. In the case of St. John, the first sweetness was changed to bitterness as soon as he had eaten it; and this is, perhaps, implied here also in ver. 14. The first ecstatic joy passed away, and the former sense of the awfulness of the work returned. </p>

<p> Shaky Before Eating </p>
<p> ABOUT THE AUTHOR </p>
<p> Laura Niedziocha began her writing career in 2007. She has contributed material to the Stoneking Physical Therapy and Wellness Center in Lambertville, N.J., and her work has appeared in various online publications. Niedziocha graduated from Temple University with a Bachelor of Science in exercise science. She also has her Associate of Arts in communications from the Community College of Philadelphia. </p>
<p> If you skip breakfast, you may start feeling shaky before lunch. </p>
<p> A symptom such as shakiness before eating is your body telling you something is not right. There are several reasons that your body may be getting shaky between meals. Hypoglycemia -- too little glucose in your blood -- is probably the main reason. Preventing hypoglycemia may help reduce shakiness and can offer some other health benefits too. </p>
<p> Glucose </p>
<p> Your body converts the carbohydrates you eat into glucose. Circulating glucose in the blood stream enters into cells with the help of insulin. Inside the cells, glucose is used to make energy. If energy is not needed then your cells store it for later. All of your cells run on glucose, and without adequate glucose your cells may not be able to function. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Hypoglycemia </p>
<p> Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood glucose runs low. It is also known as blood sugar and generally varies in a normal, healthy person between 70 and 110 mg/dL. One major symptom of hypoglycemia is shakiness. Other symptoms include hunger, sweating, nervousness, confusion, fatigue, trouble speaking and anxious behavior. </p>
<p> what it is </p>
<p> Causes </p>
<p> There are several reasons why your blood sugar may be running low, causing you to be shaky before eating. Low blood glucose could mean that you are waiting too long between meals. A condition known as reactive hypoglycemia can occur four hours after eating. If you do not snack between meals and you wait four hours for your next meal, this could be the cause. It might also mean that you are eating too few calories or too few carbohydrates. Without enough calories or carbs, your body cannot keep an adequate amount of glucose in your blood. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Prevention </p>
<p> To prevent shakiness before eating, try eating more frequently. It is best to eat three meals per day and have healthy snacks in between. You may think this is counterproductive to maintaining a healthy weight, but eating frequently gives your body energy. Eating more frequently may not only reduce shakiness; it can also improve your health. </p>

<p> Pain on the Right Side After Eating </p>
<p> ABOUT THE AUTHOR </p>
<p> Diane Marks started her writing career in 2010 and has been in health care administration for more than 30 years. She holds a registered nurse license from Citizens General Hospital School of Nursing, a Bachelor of Arts in health care education from California University of Pennsylvania and a Master of Science in health administration from the University of Pittsburgh. </p>
<p> It may seem odd that you would only develop pain on one side of your body after eating, but if you have gallstones, you may only feel pain on your right side. Gallstones are clusters of deposits that form in your gallbladder that can cause severe pain in your right side if a stone becomes lodged in the duct. If you develop pain in your right side, you need to make an appointment with your doctor or a general surgeon to determine whether or not you have gallstones. </p>
<p> The Gallbladder </p>
<p> Gallbladder disease symptoms typically develop suddenly because you may not expereince any discomfort leading up to a gallbladder attack. The gallbladder is a sac that's under the liver and is a reservoir for extra bile created by your digestive system. When you eat, bile is released into your stomach to help digest the fat content in the food you ingested. When you eat highly fatty foods, such as french fries, ice cream or chocolate, your digestive system needs more bile. The gallbladder contracts and releases extra bile to help the body digest the extra fat. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Gallbladder Disease </p>
<p> Gallbladder disease occurs when your gallbladder develops gall sludge or gallstones or when the gallbladder becomes inflamed from infection. You can live without any symptoms until the stones become large enough that they either cause infection or pain when one is forced through the gallbladder duct. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, common symptoms of a gallbladder attack include nausea, vomiting, pain in your right side of your abdomen, loss of appetite and pain following meals. </p>
<p> Treatment </p>
<p> The treatment of pain in your right side from gallbladder disease will be determined by your doctor. If your gallbladder is infected, your doctor will most likely refer you to a general surgeon to have the gallbladder removed. An infected gallbladder could lead to further infections and eventually death. If an ultrasound shows the evidence of gallstones, your doctor may prescribe certain medications that will help dissolve the gallstones. These medications can take a few years before the stones reduce in size, according to PubMed Health. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Dietary Considerations </p>
<p> The University of Maryland recommends certain dietary adjustments to treat gallbladder disease. Avoid food allergens such as wheat, soy and dairy as well as refined foods; eat foods that are high in iron and vitamin B, low in fat, high in fiber and rich in antioxidants such as cherries and blueberries; and choose lean meats. Do not change your diet without first talking with your physician. </p>

<p> Subnautica </p>
<p> Okay, so maybe this is a dumb question, but how do I eat? I've gathered up a bunch of Acid Mushrooms, but when I left click on them in my inventory, nothing happens. I just started the game and now I'm (quickly) starving to death. </p>
<p> First (no offense intended) do you really think ACID mushrooms are edible? You need to gather fish and bring them to the fabrocator to be cooked or salted for preservation. Cause if you leave them in your inventory for too long the will spoil except for preserved fish. </p>
<p> Best source of water is using bleach (coral chunk+salt deposit). It makes the biggest source of water. </p>
<p> Raw fish last indefinitely. Cured fish last indefinitely. Cooked fish don't last very long at all. </p>
<p> As far as I can tell water also has no degradation. </p>
<p> Thanks for the advice, gang. With 1% on my hunger meter, I caught a fish, cooked and ate him (or her) and saved my bacon. </p>
<p> np jason ;p btw...are all the fish in subnautica genderless/omnigendered? </p>
<p> Not sure what you mean, William. In general, fish are either male or female. And to answer your question where you mocked me concerning the acid mushrooms: the answer is, according to an older guide, those kinds of mushrooms were previously edible, hence my confusion and the reason I started this thread in the first place. </p>
<p> You can also eat raw fish, but there's a hit to thirst and they aren't nearly as filling to your hunger. You can also eat creepvine, but that's even worse food wise, and it decomposes very quickly. </p>
<p> One of my earlier encounters with acid mushrooms was when I accidentally slashed one with my knife. It released a cloud of acid which brought down my health somewhat. So, I was rather shocked to heard that Subnautica once had acid mushrooms as a food source. But I have heard that before; it's unfortunate there's a old guide out there with outdated information. </p>
<p> You can also eat creepvine, but that's even worse food wise, and it decomposes very quickly. </p>
<p> And note: DO NOT EAT DECOMPOSING CREEPVINE. In the last update they made it so that it *lowers* your food and thirst meters. </p>
<p> And yes I learned this the hard way (before the update you could still eat decomposing Creepvine) - I almost killed myself cramming down a bunch of decomposing Creepvine immediately after the update. </p>
<p> First find some titanium and quartz and craft an air tank to give you more diving time. Then catch some slow fishs like the bladder fish to turn into water and another slow one into cooked food until you're full. </p>
<p> Then try to get the resources to craft the gravball and use it to trap fish. The knife for cutting corals and gather salt to get better water with bleach. You also might want fins for speed. </p>
<p> The stillsuit and the rebreather are more difficult to get, as well as the builder tool. You need to find the right resource places. But they are most important. </p>
<p> The stillsuit will get you practically free water and only needing to care about eating. </p>
<p> The build tool will allow you to build new bases where fish and resources are. Very important. The rebreather is for the deeper diving using less oxygen. </p>
<p> When you have those things, set up a base at the coral tree biome, where you can hunt slow and meal rich fish without predators around. A few minutes hunting and you get food for days stored in your aquarium (don't tell this Nemo or your kids). </p>

<p> Accidentally Ate Moldy Bread? Here’s What to Expect </p>
<p> Bread can be a healthy addition to your diet, as it’s loaded with great ingredients that supply your daily protein intake and also help you cut down on sugars. So what’s the big deal? Purchasing bread with few preservatives usually means loaves of bread tend to have a shorter shelf life. Unfortunately, however savory these loaves can be, they usually become moldy, which results in us accidentally taking bites from slices of moldy bread. </p>
<p> Worry not, as eating these fuzzy green mold spots on slices of bread will cause us no harm. However, there is no greater scare than realizing you’ve eaten mold. Although it may make you gag, being grossed out is probably the worst thing that can happen. “In all likelihood, nothing bad will happen to you, especially if you have a healthy immune system,” said SciShow host Michael Aranda in a YouTube video. </p>
<p> However, let’s not forget that mold is a type of fungus that some people can be allergic to. According to Aranda, these allergies aren’t very serious, but there have been situations where eating mold-infested food has been fatal. Aside from the allergy concern, the separate issue with eating mold is the mycotoxins it contains. “These are chemicals various molds make under certain conditions that are toxic to humans and other creatures,” said Aranda. “For the most part, if you consume a little bit once or twice, you’ll probably be okay. But in larger doses, or over longer periods of time, they can become an issue.” </p>
<p> So how do you handle moldy food? Well, it depends on the type. Mold is easier to spread in soft foods because of the way it grows. Whether it’s on cheese, bread, meat, or dips, it should be tossed out immediately. With denser foods like carrots, strawberries, or hard cheeses, it doesn’t spread as easily, so mold is only present in the visible areas. Since mold hardly spreads, it makes it easier to cut out the spoiled parts and eat the remaining part of the food. </p>
<p> “If you see mold on food, there’s a good chance it’s also loaded with bacteria by that point, which means, mycotoxins or not, you could still get sick. It’s better to play it safe and find another snack,” Aranda explained. </p>
<p> Comment </p>
<p> Overall, if you find you’re eating moldy bread or food, don’t panic; you’ll be fine. However, you might want to look twice at your food selection next time. </p>

<p> A Sick Feeling That Can Only Be Eased by Eating </p>
<p> In many cases, when you feel ill, you also don’t feel like eating. However, certain symptoms can actually improve when you eat something. Nausea, dizziness and other ill feelings might get better if you eat something. When in doubt, eat a few soda crackers or something light, like a small cup of soup, and see if you feel better. Don’t start with a large, heavy meal. </p>
<p> Low Blood Sugar </p>
<p> sweating </p>
<p> nausea </p>
<p> Low blood sugar can be cased by a medical condition such as kidney failure or diabetes mellitus, but it can also be due to crash dieting or simply skipping meals. Once you eat, your blood sugar should go back and the symptoms and feeling of sickness will dissipate. </p>
<p> Low Blood Pressure </p>
<p> Symptoms of low blood pressure can be easily confused with symptoms of low blood sugar or other health problems 3. One of the best ways to fix low blood pressure is to eat regular small meals throughout the day and to make sure you don’t skip meals or spend too many hours without eating something. Caffeine also raises blood pressure, so you might see the symptoms disappear if you have a cup of coffee or eat some chocolate. </p>

<p> Morning Sickness </p>
<p> According to the American Pregnancy Association, about half of all pregnant women experience morning sickness 2. For some, this might be one of the earliest symptoms of pregnancy. Morning sickness is often just nausea, although some women might also experience vomiting. The best way to deal with morning sickness is to eat. Soda crackers, watermelon and salty potato chips can all help relieve the ill feeling. </p>

<p> Stress </p>
<p> People who eat for emotional issues might feel a physical need for food. When they feel stressed, depressed or upset, their bodies and minds might ask for food. Although the ill feeling is more mental than physical, it’s likely they will feel better after eating comfort foods. These can be sweets or salty foods, but they’re likely to be high in calories and fats. </p>

<p> Avoiding Shortness of Breath When Eating </p>
<p> Deborah Leader RN, PHN, is a registered nurse and medical writer who focuses on COPD. </p>
<p> Sanja Jelic, MD, is board-certified in sleep medicine, critical care medicine, pulmonary disease, and internal medicine. </p>
<p> One of the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is dyspnea, difficulty breathing that often interferes with many activities, including eating. Mealtimes can become frustrating. You may find you feel energy-depleted and malnourished because of this dyspnea, not to mention the sheer physical work it takes to finish eating your food. </p>
<p> If you are finding it difficult to complete your meals because of shortness of breath when eating, try these seven tips. And if this continues to worsen, be sure to mention it to your physician. </p>
<p> Eat for Energy </p>
<p> Because some people with COPD are thin or even malnourished, it's best to choose foods that are high in calories to keep your energy levels soaring, which will positively impact your breathing.﻿﻿ Try filling your plate with plant-based fats like coconut, olives, avocado, and nuts and seeds. </p>
<p> Likewise, be sure to include lots of fruits and vegetables in your diet, as they will give you the nutrients you need to fight infection and minimize inflammation.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Choose Easy-to-Chew Foods </p>
<p> Foods that are hard to chew are also difficult to swallow. This puts you at greater risk for choking, aspiration pneumonia, and even death. Excess chewing can also zap your energy levels during meals, making it impossible for you to finish your meal. </p>
<p> Eating foods that are easy to chew will help you conserve energy so you retain more for breathing. Choosing tender, well-cooked meat, rather than tougher cuts, and well-cooked fruits and vegetables (rather than raw) may help. On the days you are exceptionally fatigued, consider a liquid meal, like a whole-food, protein-rich smoothie, or a liquid meal replacement or nutritional supplement, such as Ensure or Boost. </p>
<p> Opt for Smaller, More Frequent Meals </p>
<p> Eating more frequently means you'll require less food at each sitting, resulting in less labored breathing while you eat. Shifting to smaller meals can also reduce the pressure in your stomach after eating, making it easier to breathe while also reducing the risk of heartburn. </p>
<p> Clear Your Airways Before Dining </p>
<p> Effective airway clearance is an important part of COPD management and can be especially beneficial before meals. When done on a regular basis, airway clearance techniques can help remove sputum (mucus) from the lungs.﻿﻿ This can help you breathe more easily and feel better overall. </p>
<p> There are a few different airway breathing techniques you can perform, including: </p>
<p> Postural drainage (which is usually coupled with chest physiotherapy) </p>
<p> Go Slow </p>
<p> Eating too fast not only interferes with your digestion and causes you to eat more than you should, but it can drain you of essential energy, making breathing during meals that much more difficult. The next time you sit down to eat, try making your meal last at least 20 minutes. </p>
<p> Take small bites and chew your food slowly. Make a conscious effort to breathe while you are eating. Put your utensils down between bites to ensure that you take your time. </p>
<p> Eat While Sitting Upright </p>
<p> Lying down or slumping while eating can place added pressure on your diaphragm. Proper posture, especially during meal times, will benefit your breathing by keeping excess pressure off your diaphragm, the major muscle of respiration. </p>
<p> Use Pursed-Lip Breathing </p>
<p> Pursed-lip breathing is a breathing technique that is very helpful to use when you become short of breath. It can also help reduce the anxiety associated with dyspnea and allow you to finish a meal.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Perform pursed-lip breathing when you feel short of breath during meals and you may be surprised at what a difference it can make. </p>
<p> To perform pursed-lip breathing, first, relax your shoulders by dropping them down. Then follow these three steps: </p>
<p> Take a normal breath through your nose with your mouth closed for two seconds. </p>
<p> Pucker your lips like you are about to give someone a kiss or blow out a candle. </p>
<p> Very slowly breathe out through your mouth for four seconds. </p>
<p> Save Beverages Until You're Done </p>
<p> When you drink liquids during your meals, you may fill up quickly and feel full or bloated, which can then lead to difficulty breathing. Try waiting until the end of your meal to drink your beverages. But, of course, if you need to sip water while you eat to make food go down easier, do so. </p>
<p> In addition, avoid bubbly drinks, especially sugary sodas, as sugar may cause inflammation and carbonation may worsen your breathing.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> A Word From Verywell </p>
<p> Eating should be a pleasurable activity, and nutrition is an essential component of living well with COPD. If you are finding it difficult to eat because of shortness of breath from your lung condition, speak with your doctor in addition to trying these strategies. You may need to be tested for supplemental oxygen use and you may benefit from seeing a dietitian or nutritionist. </p>

<p> Cannibalism at sea: the starving Victorian sailors who ate a cabin boy </p>
<p> When, in 1884, the starving crew of the ill-fated yacht Mignonette sacrificed a man in order to survive, the horrific killing became immortalised in legal history, relates Carl Thompson </p>
<p> On 19 May 1884 four men set sail from Southampton in a small yacht. They were professional sailors tasked with taking their vessel, the Mignonette, to its new owner in Australia. As men reared to the sea, born and raised in coastal communities, they were under no illusions as to the dangers of an ocean voyage. Yet none of the Mignonette’s crew can have anticipated the full horror that lay ahead. And they certainly could not have imagined that their voyage, and the ordeal they would endure, would leave a lasting legal and cultural legacy – a legacy that extends right down to the present day. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The Mignonette’s captain, Tom Dudley, was 31 years old and a proven yachtsman. Of his crew, Ned Brooks and mate Edwin Stephens were likewise seasoned sailors. The final crew-member, cabin boy Richard Parker, was just 17 years old and making his first voyage on the open sea; however, he came from a seafaring family and had sailed extensively on inshore waters. </p>
<p> On 5 July, sailing from Madeira to Cape Town, the Mignonette was sunk by a giant wave. Its crew escaped in the yacht’s dinghy but found themselves in a desperate situation. Adrift in an open boat in the South Atlantic, hundreds of miles from land, they had little in the way of provisions. They had no water, and for food, only two 1lb tins of turnips grabbed during the Mignonette’s final moments. </p>
<p> Over the next 12 days, these turnips were scrupulously rationed out, with Dudley using his penknife to divide precisely the tiny portions. This meagre fare was supplemented for a while by the meat of a turtle, caught as it swam by the boat. For water, however, the crew could do little more than catch rain drops whenever a squall blew up. They therefore resorted to drinking their own urine, although this too was a diminishing resource as their bodies became increasingly dehydrated. </p>
<p> By 17 July all supplies on board the little dinghy had been exhausted. After a further three days, the inexperienced Richard Parker could not resist gulping down sea water in an attempt to allay his thirst. It is now known that small quantities of sea water can help to sustain life in survival situations, but in that period it was widely believed to be fatal. Parker also drank far in excess of modern recommendations and he was soon violently unwell, collapsing in the bottom of the boat with diarrhoea. </p>
<p> Even before Parker fell ill, Tom Dudley had broached the fearful topic of the ‘custom of the sea’, the practice of drawing lots to select a sacrificial victim who could be consumed by his crew-mates. Over the coming days, as Parker’s condition deteriorated, Dudley raised the idea again. As he insisted to Stephens in the early hours of 25 July, when the men had been adrift for almost three weeks: “The boy is dying. You have a wife and five children, and I have a wife and three children. Human flesh has been eaten before.” </p>
<p> A grisly decision </p>
<p> Stephens put off any decision, but at daybreak Parker seemed weaker than ever. Significant looks were exchanged between captain and mate. According to their subsequent depositions, however, no lots were drawn. Instead, Dudley told Stephens to hold Parker’s legs should he struggle, before kneeling and thrusting his penknife into the boy’s jugular. A chronometer case was used to catch the oozing blood and this was quickly passed between Parker’s three crew-mates, to moisten their parched mouths. Parker’s body was then stripped and butchered. The heart and liver were eaten immediately; strips of flesh were cut from his limbs and set aside as future rations. What remained of the young man was heaved overboard. </p>
<p> Dudley, Stephens and Brooks survived on this grisly diet for several days. But when the meat cut from the cabin boy began to rot, the crew again faced the grisly prospect of following the custom of the sea. This time, however, no sacrifice was required. On 29 July, when the men had been adrift for 24 days, a ship was sighted on the horizon. The Moctezuma, a German vessel bound for Hamburg, spotted the dinghy and came to the aid of its emaciated crew. The Mignonette’s survivors were soon being cared for, and a month later they arrived back in England, disembarking at Falmouth. </p>
<p> At this point the Mignonette’s unlucky crew must have thought that their suffering was over. But for Dudley and Stephens a new ordeal was just beginning. From the moment he was rescued, Dudley made no attempt to hide or gloss over the sad fate of Richard Parker. He was a forthright, honest man and to his mind killing and consuming Parker was a tragic necessity. However repugnant it was to take such drastic measures, they were justified, he would always maintain, by well-established maritime traditions. </p>
<p> Dudley made no attempt to hide or gloss over the sad fate of Richard Parker. He was a forthright, honest man and to his mind killing and consuming Parker was a tragic necessity </p>
<p> The authorities in Britain viewed matters differently. Public opinion in Falmouth was mostly sympathetic to the crew’s action. However, the local shipping master was required by law to notify the Board of Trade of a violent death on a British ship. He duly sent a telegram to London, then reluctantly arrested the survivors pending further investigation. </p>
<p> Dudley and the others were amazed at this turn of events. Little did they know that they were now caught up in a legal process less concerned with their specific case than with reaching a general ruling on the legitimacy of the custom of the sea. Ten years previously, lots had been drawn and another hapless victim cannibalised after the wreck of the Euxine, and at that date the legal establishment had sought to prosecute the perpetrators. However, the case had collapsed due to procedural problems. A decade on, the Home Office saw a new opportunity to define the law’s stance on these tragic episodes. </p>
<p> The crew of the Mignonette duly appeared before local magistrates. Brooks was exonerated, being deemed to have played little active part in either the killing of the boy or the prior discussions about his fate. But Dudley and Stephens, to their surprise and horror, were arraigned for murder. </p>
<p> Outside the courtroom, public sympathies ran strongly in favour of the Mignonette survivors. Parker’s eldest brother, Daniel, also a sailor, twice shook hands with Dudley and Stephens, as if to offer the family’s pardon for their actions. </p>
<p> Yet when the trial began in Exeter in November 1884, it was soon apparent that the outcome was largely predetermined. Addressing both the jury and a packed chamber, Judge Baron Huddleston opened the trial with a detailed explanation as to why the law could not recognise necessity as justification for killing. The defence case was thus invalidated before it had even been delivered. </p>
<p> Listen: Journalist Andrea Pitzer discusses a compelling story of survival in the Arctic during the 16th century on this episode of the HistoryExtra podcast: </p>
<p> Guilty verdict </p>
<p> Despite this steering by the judge, the jury was reluctant to pronounce Dudley and Stephens guilty. Murder was a capital offence, and a guilty verdict would automatically condemn the men to execution; only if their sentence was commuted would they be saved this fate. At this juncture, in another preplanned gambit, Huddleston offered the jury the option of returning a ‘special verdict’, an unusual judicial procedure which referred the case up to a higher court. </p>
<p> So it was that Dudley and Stephens were ultimately convicted of murder not by a jury of their peers but by a panel of five judges. This verdict required the senior judge, Justice Coleridge, to sentence the seamen to death, although it was assumed in the press that a pardon would quickly follow. For several agonising days, however, no pardon was forthcoming, as the Home Office hesitated over an appropriate response to this unusual case. Two convicted murderers, it was felt, could not walk completely free of punishment, whatever the mitigating circumstances. In the end the home secretary settled on a sentence of six months’ imprisonment, and the hapless Dudley and Stephens were duly despatched to Holloway prison to serve out this term. </p>
<p> Professor and historian of law Brian Simpson has described the Mignonette trial as “procedurally, a complete mess”. Yet it gave a definitive ruling on the custom of the sea, and Regina vs Dudley and Stephens remains to this day the case used to introduce students of common law to the complexities involved in pleading necessity as a defence for murder. In this way the crew of the Mignonette have achieved a degree of immortality – although doubtless it is a fame none of them would have wished for. </p>
<p> Away from law courses and schoolrooms, the greatest victim in the whole sorry episode has also achieved another sort of afterlife. Richard Parker lives on, albeit strangely transformed, in Yann Martel’s bestselling novel Life of Pi (2001) and director Ang Lee’s later 3D film. But here, in an act of poetic justice, Parker’s grisly fate has been reversed. Similarly adrift in an open boat, Martel’s Parker is in no danger of being killed and eaten by his companions. Instead, being a full-grown Bengal tiger, it is he who now represents the force of nature and of ravenous appetite. </p>
<p> An unlucky name? </p>
<p> Seafarers called ‘Richard Parker’ seem to suffer from a curse </p>
<p> It seems inadvisable for anyone called Richard Parker to go to sea. As commentators at the time noticed, the Mignonette victim shares his name with an ill-fated character in Edgar Allan Poe’s masterpiece of maritime horror, the Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (1837). Poe’s character Parker leads a mutiny on board the Grampus. When the ship is wrecked, he finds himself adrift with the novel’s eponymous hero and two other characters. Just like the crew of the Mignonette, the survivors are racked with hunger and reduced to following the custom of the sea. Unlike real life, here it is Richard Parker who proposes that lots be drawn. But in an eerie anticipation of actual events, it is then Parker who draws the short straw and ends up being eaten by his companions. </p>
<p> Forty years before Poe’s novel, another sailor called Richard Parker also met a violent end. One of the ringleaders of the naval mutiny at the Nore in 1797, this Parker was subsequently hanged from the yardarm of HMS Sandwich. Poe named his mutineer after this historical figure, while author Yann Martel’s Richard Parker in Life of Pi (2001) arguably channels all three precursors, to evoke both the spectre of cannibalism and the mutinous impulses in the body which drive us to such repulsive acts. </p>

<p> TRY OUR SEARCH! </p>
<p> Whenever I try to eat anything I get so sick to the point I regret putting anything into my mouth. I always feel nauseous and hate the smell of food in the morning, it gives me diarrhea just smelling food. I can only drink coffee in the morning but even coffee makes my stomach hurt but still is okay to deal as long as I don't eat anything with it. Whenever I eat something I feel like I will throw up but I don't I feel like I got punched in the stomach and the food js does not want to go through my stomach. I can only eat small snack but my stomach can only accept so little that I mostly live on beverages and fiber bars know. I don't really go to the bathroom only for number #1 I don't have any bad bowl movements but I do have a lot of gas at times when trying to eat something. This has been happening for so long now that I really don't like eating anything at all I drink a lot of water and have the smallest snacks possible my stomach doesn't accept anything else. If I try to eat I end up feeling the worse cramps ,not cramps but literally like someone has punched me so damn hard in the stomach that I can't breath and I js want to vomit but can't. Is this something I should worry about?? I'm 19 and a female </p>

<p> Diarrhea After Eating: Why It Happens and How to Stop It </p>
<p> Diarrhea that happens after you eat a meal is known as postprandial diarrhea (PD). This type of diarrhea is often unexpected, and the feeling to use the restroom can be quite urgent. </p>
<p> Some people with PD experience painful bowel movements (BMs). In most cases, this pain resolves after the BM. </p>
<p> The condition isn’t uncommon, but getting to a diagnosis can be difficult. That’s because PD is sometimes the symptom of another condition. </p>
<p> For example, some people experience only diarrhea with irritable bowel syndrome. This is called IBS-diarrhea or IBS-D. PD can be a symptom of IBS-D. </p>
<p> In other cases, PD occurs for no diagnosable reason. </p>
<p> The conditions or issues that can cause PD fall into two primary categories: acute, which lasts for a short duration, and chronic, which lasts long term. Keep reading to learn more. </p>
<p> Some conditions or issues may cause a brief bout of PD. Time may put a stop to the PD symptoms, or medicine may be required. These causes include: </p>
<p> Viral infection: Viral infections, like stomach bugs, can cause temporary PD and make your digestive tract extra sensitive. The PD may last for a few days, even after other symptoms have eased. </p>
<p> Lactose intolerance: People with an allergy to lactose, a type of sugar found in dairy products, may experience PD if they eat foods containing lactose. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. </p>
<p> Food poisoning: The human body does a good job of knowing it has eaten something it shouldn’t. When it detects the bad food, your body will probably try to expel it immediately. That may cause diarrhea or vomiting within a few minutes of eating the contaminated food. </p>
<p> Sugar malabsorption: This condition is very similar to lactose intolerance. Some people’s bodies can’t properly absorb sugars like lactose and fructose. When these sugars enter the intestine, they can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues. </p>
<p> Toddler’s diarrhea: Toddlers and young children who drink a lot of fruit juice may develop PD. The high amounts of sugar in these drinks can draw water into the bowels, which can cause watery stools and diarrhea. </p>
<p> Parasites: Foodborne parasites can cause PD. The most common type of foodborne parasite is the tapeworm. Symptoms, including PD, will last until the parasite is removed from your body or dies. </p>
<p> Magnesium overdose: High levels of magnesium can cause diarrhea. However, getting too much of this mineral is difficult unless you’re taking a supplement. </p>
<p> Chronic causes of PD are conditions that may need ongoing treatment in order to prevent PD symptoms. These conditions include: </p>
<p> Irritable bowel syndrome: IBS is a disorder that causes a variety of gastrointestinal issues. These include diarrhea, bloating, gas, and abdominal cramping. It’s not clear what causes IBS. </p>
<p> Celiac disease: This autoimmune condition causes damage in your intestines each time you eat gluten. Gluten is a protein found most commonly in wheat products. </p>
<p> Microscopic colitis: This condition causes inflammation of your large intestine. In addition to diarrhea, symptoms include gas and abdominal cramping. The inflammation isn’t always present, however. That means symptoms of PD can come and go. </p>
<p> Bile acid malabsorption: Your gallbladder produces bile to help break down and digest fats in your food. If these acids aren’t properly reabsorbed, they may irritate your large intestines. This can lead to watery stools and diarrhea. </p>
<p> Gallbladder removal: People who have their gallbladder removed may experience frequent diarrhea in the first few weeks and months after the surgery. In most cases, the diarrhea will eventually stop, but some people will continue to have chronic diarrhea or PD after the surgery. </p>
<p> Dumping syndrome: This complication of weight loss surgery isn’t common, but it can be a cause of PD. With this condition, your stomach empties very quickly after eating. This triggers the reflex that manages bowel movements, so diarrhea may be more common. </p>
<p> If your doctor diagnoses you with IBS-D or PD, ask if it’s possible another condition is responsible for your symptoms. In some cases, an IBS-D diagnosis may prevent some doctors from considering other conditions. </p>
<p> Many of the conditions that cause PD require medical treatment, but these four lifestyle treatments may also ease the condition: </p>
<p> Avoid trigger foods: Certain foods may contribute to PD. If you aren’t sure what your trigger foods are, keep a food diary. Make note of what you eat and when you experience PD. Look for food commonly associated with PD, such as fatty foods, fiber, and dairy. </p>
<p> Practice food safety: Keep bad bacteria at bay by washing fruits and vegetables before eating them, cooking meat to the proper temperature, and properly refrigerating foods that need to be kept cold. </p>
<p> Eat smaller meals: Eat five to six small meals a day instead of three big ones. This may help your intestines more easily digest food, and that could reduce symptoms of PD. </p>
<p> Reduce stress: Your mind has a lot of power over your gut. When you’re stressed or worried, you may make your stomach upset more easily. Learning to manage your stress and anxiety is good not only for your mental health, but also for your digestive health. </p>
<p> Diarrhea happens from time to time. It’s not often a serious concern. However, serious complications are possible, so check with your doctor if you experience any of these additional symptoms: </p>
<p> Frequency: If diarrhea occurs several times a week for more than three weeks, or if you have diarrhea for three days in a row, make an appointment with your doctor. </p>
<p> Fever: If you have diarrhea and a fever over 102°F (38.8°C), seek medical treatment. </p>
<p> Pain: If the diarrhea is common but you start experiencing severe abdominal pain or rectal pain during a BM, talk with your doctor. </p>
<p> Dehydration: It’s important you stay properly hydrated when you have diarrhea. Drinking water or drinks with electrolytes can help you stay well despite the diarrhea. However, if you start showing signs of dehydration, seek medical attention. Signs of dehydration include: </p>
<p> extreme thirst </p>
<p> confusion </p>
<p> muscle cramps </p>
<p> dark-colored urine </p>
<p> Discolored stool: If you start having black, gray, or bloody stools, talk with your doctor. These can be signs of a more serious gastrointestinal problem. </p>
<p> There isn’t one single tool or test that can help doctors identify and diagnose the source of PD. Because of this, they often recommend certain treatment options one at a time until they find one that works consistently. </p>
<p> When a treatment works, it helps your doctor understand what’s responsible for PD. From there, they can continue to narrow down the potential causes and come up with a full treatment plan. </p>

<p> Causes of Diarrhea After Eating </p>
<p> Barbara Bolen, PhD, is a licensed clinical psychologist and health coach. She has written multiple books focused on living with irritable bowel syndrome. </p>
<p> Priyanka Chugh, MD, is a board-certified gastroenterologist in practice with Trinity Health of New England in Waterbury, Connecticut. </p>
<p> Experiencing diarrhea right after you eat is known as postprandial diarrhea.﻿﻿ It may just have started occurring, in which case it is acute, or you may have had it for a long time and it is a chronic condition. Learning about the common causes of diarrhea after meals will help you be able to work with your doctor on an effective treatment plan. </p>
<p> Any new or ongoing digestive symptom should be brought to the attention of your doctor so that you can obtain an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Although diarrhea after eating may be the result of one of the health conditions described here, it can also be a sign of other serious diseases. </p>
<p> Acute Diarrhea After Meals </p>
<p> Acute diarrhea is a sudden onset of diarrhea episodes. Diarrhea due to any cause may occur after eating, as the simple act of eating stimulates muscle movement within your large intestine to empty your bowels. When you have an underlying cause such as an infection, food poisoning, or IBS, these contractions may be stronger and more painful than usual and come with a sense of urgency.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Causes </p>
<p> These may be causes of acute diarrhea: </p>
<p> Bacterial infections such as Salmonella or E. coli </p>
<p> Food poisoning </p>
<p> Viral infections (commonly referred to as the "stomach flu") </p>
<p> Parasites such as Giardia </p>
<p> Medications such as antacids, antibiotics, chemotherapy </p>
<p> Lactose intolerance (may also be a chronic cause) </p>
<p> Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D), which may also be a chronic cause </p>
<p> What to Do for Acute Diarrhea </p>
<p> Follow these tips when you have a bout of diarrhea: </p>
<p> Stay hydrated. You will need to replace the fluids and minerals that your body is not absorbing due to the rapid transit of stool through your system. Try to drink water and clear fruit juice and sip broth. </p>
<p> Don't rush to use an over-the-counter diarrhea product such as Imodium or Kaopectate. These products should not be used if you have a fever or there is mucus or blood in your stools. Pepto Bismol may be an option but check with your doctor first. None of these medications should be given to children without prior approval from the child's doctor.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> When to Call Your Doctor </p>
<p> You should call your doctor immediately if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Dehydration symptoms including decreased urine, dry mouth, sunken eyes </p>
<p> Fever above 100º F or that lasts more than three days </p>
<p> Severe stomach pain </p>
<p> Worsening of diarrhea symptoms, or if diarrhea is still present two days later in an infant or child, and five days later for an adult </p>
<p> Know the red flag digestive symptoms, which are especially dangerous symptoms to watch out for that call for an immediate medical consultation. These include rectal bleeding, vomiting, lack of appetite, significant weight loss, fever, abdominal pain and cramping at night, and anemia. </p>
<p> Chronic Diarrhea </p>
<p> An ongoing problem with diarrhea after meals may be due to a wide variety of health problems that have chronic diarrhea as a symptom. If you have one of these disorders, the simple act of eating a meal may serve as a trigger for diarrhea episodes. </p>
<p> Common Causes </p>
<p> Addressing the underlying illness can help to bring about relief from the symptom of running to the bathroom after meals: </p>
<p> Infection: As with acute diarrhea, there are infections that can cause chronic diarrhea.﻿﻿ These include Giardia lamblia, strongyloidiasis, and amoeba. </p>
<p> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Just the simple act of eating can be enough to set off the symptom of diarrhea in some people who have IBS. It is not clearly known why there is such a hyperreactivity of the digestive system in this disorder. </p>
<p> Bile acid diarrhea (BAD): Researchers are starting to find evidence that some people who are diagnosed with IBS actually have BAD.﻿﻿ Bile acids are secreted by your gallbladder in order for your digestive system to digest fats. When these acids are not reabsorbed properly, they serve to stimulate contractions in your large intestine, resulting in diarrhea. Sometimes the cause of BAD is unknown; other times it occurs following surgery or illness involving your digestive organs (your gallbladder, pancreas or your small intestine, for example). </p>
<p> Gallbladder removal: Without a gallbladder, some people experience a problem with poor regulation of bile acids into the small and large intestines, causing similar symptoms as BAD. Although this symptom usually resolves itself quickly after the surgery date, for some people it remains an ongoing problem. </p>
<p> Lactose intolerance: People who have lactose intolerance lack sufficient amounts of the enzyme necessary to break down lactose, a sugar found in milk and milk products. This can cause the symptom of diarrhea after consuming dairy foods.﻿﻿ Lactose intolerance can be identified through the use of a breath test or an elimination diet. </p>
<p> Sugar malabsorption: In addition to lactose, some people are unable to digest the sugars fructose and sorbitol. Fructose is found in many fruits and high fructose corn syrup. Sorbitol is also found in some fruits as well as artificial sweeteners. Like lactose intolerance, fructose or sorbitol malabsorption can be identified through the use of breath testing or an elimination diet. </p>
<p> Celiac disease: People who have celiac disease experience an autoimmune reaction in response to ingesting gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Diarrhea from celiac disease is often odorous, and stool may be more likely to float rather than sink. Celiac disease has serious health consequences and you should be screened for this disease if you are experiencing chronic diarrhea. </p>
<p> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): The two forms of IBD—Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis—can both cause the symptom of diarrhea after eating.﻿﻿ Unlike any of the above health problems, the diarrhea of IBD may include signs of blood in the stool. Any sign of blood in the stool needs to be immediately brought to the attention of your doctor. </p>
<p> Dumping syndrome: This syndrome is most commonly experienced by people who have undergone bariatric surgery for weight loss. Dumping syndrome is also known as rapid gastric emptying because the contents of the stomach empty too quickly into the small intestine. Eating can trigger symptoms such as diarrhea, especially eating meals with high sugar content. </p>
<p> Microscopic colitis: This type of colitis is a distinctly different illness than ulcerative colitis. With microscopic colitis, inflammation of the cells lining the intestines can only be seen when tissue is looked at under a microscope. The cause of microscopic colitis is not well known. Its symptoms include persistent or intermittent episodes of watery diarrhea.﻿﻿ </p>
<p> Colon cancer: Chronic diarrhea is not typically a sign of colon cancer (constipation may be more likely), however any change in the frequency of bowel movements has been associated with the presence of cancer. Other symptoms of colon cancer include blood in or on the stool, fatigue, anemia, and unexplained weight loss. If you have any of these symptoms alongside chronic diarrhea, you need to see your doctor immediately. </p>
<p> Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency: In this condition, the pancreas does not produce enough digestive enzymes to fully digest the foods that you eat.﻿﻿ Although there is a test for pancreatic exocrine functioning that involves measuring the amount of fat in stools, researchers have theorized that this test may not be accurate in detecting a mild insufficiency that causes postprandial diarrhea. Research in this area is quite limited. A review found one study that showed a small percentage of IBS-D patients do suffer from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. In another small study, IBS-D patients who were given pancrelipase, a form of pancreatic digestive enzymes, reported a reduction in episodes of postprandial diarrhea. </p>
<p> What to Do for Chronic Diarrhea After Eating </p>
<p> Follow these tips if you have ongoing problems with diarrhea after eating: </p>
<p> Tell your doctor. Any unusual symptom should always be brought to the attention of your doctor. This helps to ensure that you receive a proper diagnosis and therefore a helpful treatment plan can be developed. </p>
<p> Follow your doctor's orders to best manage your underlying health problem. </p>
<p> Eat small meals throughout your day and avoid fatty foods, such as fried food, fatty meats, and thick gravy. Large meals and fatty foods can increase the strength of intestinal contractions and thus prompt a diarrhea episode. </p>
<p> Use relaxation exercises to calm your body. Due to the close connection between your brain and your gut, stress can be a trigger for diarrhea.﻿﻿ Many people deal with a lot of stress in their lives, not to mention the fact that having diarrhea after your meals is stressful. Both deep-breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation skills can be effective in calming your body and therefore offer the potential for slowing down the emptying of your bowels. </p>
<p> Theories on Postprandial Diarrhea Syndrome in IBS </p>
<p> New theories are emerging to suggest that something else might be going on for some patients who have been diagnosed with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Research on postprandial diarrhea is quite limited. Here are avenues that preliminary research has identified. </p>
<p> Postprandial Diarrhea Syndrome </p>
<p> Two IBS researchers, Drs. Money and Camilleri, have proposed three possible causes for what they call "postprandial diarrhea syndrome." They acknowledge that diagnostic markers are limited, and suggest that positive response to treatment of the theorized problem might serve as confirmation of the diagnosis. </p>
<p> They believe three diagnoses should be considered: bile acid malabsorption (BAM), pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and glucosidase deficiency. </p>
<p> Excessive Gastric Acid </p>
<p> Excessive amounts of gastric acid have long been associated with the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A small study found that GERD medications given to a group of IBS-D patients resulted in a significant decrease in symptoms of diarrhea and postprandial urgency. However, this finding has not been replicated. </p>
<p> Small Bowel Water Content </p>
<p> A group of researchers found that, compared to healthy control subjects, IBS-D patients have lower amounts of water in the small intestine and it passes through quicker to the large intestine, which may contribute to postprandial diarrhea. </p>
<p> This research dovetails with the FODMAPs theory for IBS as foods with high osmotic value (meaning they produce higher volumes of fluid) are particularly troublesome for people with IBS. If true, the development of medications that would slow transit time and thus better regulate the flow of liquid into the large intestine may be of value. </p>
<p> Clearly, research into the factors behind postprandial diarrhea in IBS is quite limited, and therefore no definitive conclusions can be drawn. In addition, despite the variety of plausible theories explaining the problem, data regarding treatments for this condition don't exist, so it's unclear thus far which treatments will help patients, and which do not. </p>
<p> Hopefully, further research will shed more light on the subject and offer some effective treatment options. In the meantime, if you tend to experience urgent diarrhea episodes after eating, discuss the subject with your physician to see if any of the proposed interventions would be a safe option for you. </p>
<p> A Word From Verywell </p>
<p> When diarrhea happens right after eating it becomes hard to enjoy a meal. You may become wary of what to eat and anxious about eating anything at all. You are not alone. Many people have this symptom. Work with your doctor to find the underlying cause. You may be able to find solutions so you can enjoy your meals without fear of needing to rush to the restroom. </p>

<p> What Should You Do If Your Dog Ate a Squirrel? </p>
<p> Did you see your dog catch and eat a squirrel? Or have you found some rather suspicious fur scattered in the backyard and noticed that your dog has a rather guilty expression? If you’re pretty sure that your dog has eaten a squirrel, you’re probably anxious about the consequences and next steps. </p>
<p> If your dog killed the squirrel himself before eating it, there’s usually no need to panic but there are things you need to do. If the squirrel bit your dog, clean the wounds with hydrogen peroxide. </p>
<p> If your dog ate a squirrel that was already dead, you will have to try to find out whether the squirrel was poisoned. Contact your dog’s veterinarian for advice and bring the animal in for testing to make sure that he didn’t catch any parasites or bacterial infections from the squirrel. </p>

<p> What Should You Do If Your Dog Kills And Eats A Squirrel? </p>
<p> If you see that your dog has caught a squirrel, it’s probably best to try to stop him from eating it. Use the “leave it” command. If your dog doesn’t already know this command and how to obey it, teach it so that you will be able to deal with things more effectively if the situation arises again. </p>
<p> If you have a yard where you can bury the squirrel, do so but choose an area that your dog does not go into (as he will try to dig it up). If this is not possible or you don’t have a yard, wrap the dead squirrel in garbage bags, at least two layers of them. </p>
<p> Once you’ve done that, contact a vet clinic in your area to ask if they can take it. If they cannot, contact Animal Control. They should be able to pick up the dead squirrel. You should do this as quickly as possible. </p>
<p> Can Dogs Get Sick from Killing a Squirrel? </p>
<p> If your dog killed and ate a squirrel, the only negative effects your pet will probably experience will be bites from the squirrel and the possibility that he has caught ticks. Dogs can catch ticks just from being out in the garden, though, so make sure your dog is always being given a preventative tick treatment. </p>
<p> This is important because ticks can carry Lyme Disease. Lyme Disease is a serious disease and has symptoms such as loss of appetite, fever, joint pain, and lameness. If you think your dog could have contracted Lyme Disease, bring him to the vet. If he tests positive, he will need to be given antibiotics. The treatment usually lasts 30 days. </p>
<p> In some regions of the United States, squirrels carry leptospirosis. This is a species of bacteria that adversely affects the internal organs, especially the kidneys and liver. Leptospirosis can be carried in the squirrel’s urine. If your dog is exposed to that urine, for example, if the urine is released while he is killing the squirrel, he could catch it. </p>
<p> It’s extremely rare (or even unheard of) for rabies to be contracted as a result of contact with a squirrel. Rabies usually kills squirrels very quickly, most often before they’ve had a chance to spread the disease. Still, if your dog is bitten or scratched by a squirrel or eats a squirrel, you should call your vet for advice. </p>
<p> Why Do Dogs Chase Squirrels? </p>
<p> Dogs chase squirrels because of their natural instincts as a predator, as well as their love of fun and exercise! Certain breeds of dogs have stronger instincts in this area than others. </p>
<p> For example, terriers are especially enthusiastic hunters of all kinds of rodents, including squirrels. This is because they were originally bred to hunt vermin. </p>
<p> Some pet owners worry that if their dog had killed a squirrel it might mean that they are aggressive or dangerous. There is no need to be concerned about this. Your dog’s desire to catch a squirrel is perfectly natural and something he does instinctively. </p>
<p> A dog that killed a squirrel is not dangerous to you or other people. The two things are entirely unrelated. Your dog would never see you or another person as prey. It might mean, however, that you should be careful about letting your dog be around small animals. </p>
<p> What Could Happen If Your Dog Eats a Dead Squirrel? </p>
<p> If your dog has eaten a squirrel that was already dead when he found it, there is more of a risk to your pet’s well-being, in fact, if the squirrel has been rotting for several days, it could have an infestation of parasites. Also, your dog will end up with food poisoning that will involve a lot of diarrhea. </p>
<p> Poisoning </p>
<p> The most worrying part of your dog eating an already dead squirrel is the possibility that the squirrel could have been poisoned. If the squirrel has poison in its system, this will end up inside your dog. </p>
<p> While it’s against the law for people to poison squirrels, there is a possibility that your neighbors might have done so anyway because they have a problem with squirrels nesting in their attics. </p>
<p> This is why if your dog eats a dead squirrel, you need to diplomatically ask your neighbors to confide in you if they have used poison on squirrels. If they tell you that they have, you must bring your dog to the vet immediately. </p>
<p> If your dog has ingested any poison as a result of eating a dead squirrel, he will probably become very ill. The dose of poison he will have ingested probably won’t lead to death, but it will cause a significant level of sickness that will need veterinary treatment. </p>
<p> Parasites </p>
<p> Two of the parasites that your dog can become infected with if they eat a dead squirrel are roundworm and coccidia. Your dog will get roundworm if the squirrel he eats is infected with roundworm larvae. </p>
<p> When your dog has roundworms, the worms consume the nutrients your dog gets from his diet. This means that your pet will end up malnourished. It is essential that roundworm is promptly treated to prevent your dog from becoming dangerously ill. </p>
<p> Some of the symptoms of roundworm can include lethargy, abdominal swelling, vomiting, loss of appetite, abnormal feces, colic, and coughing. The coughing indicates that the larvae have entered the lungs. If you think your dog might have roundworm, seek veterinary treatment. </p>
<p> Some of the symptoms of coccidia include vomiting, dehydration, diarrhea (this can even include blood and mucus if the illness is especially severe), and loss of appetite. Immunosuppressed and young dogs tend to be most susceptible to coccidia. </p>
<p> While it’s very rare for death to occur as a result of coccidia, it can cause dehydration and other effects that can be dangerous in themselves. Be aware that some dogs that contract coccidia are asymptomatic and act as carriers of the parasite. You should have your dog tested if he eats a squirrel. </p>
<p> How to Stop Your Dog From Eating a Dead Squirrel </p>
<p> The best way of stopping your dog from eating a dead squirrel is through the use of the “leave it” command. Of course, in order for this command to be effective, your dog must know it and be used to obeying it long before he sees and wants to eat the dead squirrel! </p>
<p> Get started on teaching your dog the “leave it” command so that you have that tool at hand if he ever wants to eat a dead squirrel. There are several different methods of teaching “leave it.” </p>
<p> One popular way is to place a treat on the floor. As your dog comes over to investigate or tries to eat it, use your foot to cover the treatment. Keep your foot resolutely in place until your dog gives up on getting the treat. Giving up means generally means walking away and becoming interested in something else. </p>
<p> After your dog finally gives up, say the word “yes” or use a clicker, and then give your dog a reward. This reward will be another (specifically a different) treat. Go through this entire process over and over until your dog understands when he needs to leave something alone and the fact that he will be rewarded if he obeys. </p>
<p> Once this milestone has been met, try putting the treat on the floor but not covering it, only saying “leave it” to tell your dog that he shouldn’t try to eat it. After your dog has demonstrated that he can obey this, try it on walks, as well. </p>
<p> Are Squirrels Dangerous For Dogs? </p>
<p> A squirrel is much smaller than a dog. You’re not likely to see one trying to chase around your big German Shepherd! In all seriousness, however, squirrels can carry certain parasites and have ticks that can lead to health problems for your pet. </p>
<p> As we discussed earlier, squirrels can carry parasites (for example, roundworms) and they can have ticks on their body that can travel over to your dog. Ticks carry a host of diseases, such as Lyme Disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, tularemia, American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH), and others. </p>
<p> This is why it’s essential that you treat your dog with preventative tick treatments on a regular basis. Talk to your vet for more information. Your dog can pick up ticks even from being in the same yard as an animal (such as a squirrel) that has them. </p>
<p> Are Squirrels Droppings Dangerous For Dogs? </p>
<p> Squirrel droppings often contain salmonella bacteria and leptospirosis. They are very tiny, often around the size of a grain of rice. Leptospirosis can be found in squirrel urine, as well. Leptospirosis is often referred to as “lepto.” </p>
<p> Leptospirosis is most likely to thrive in damp environments, especially where there are puddles. Make sure that your dog is vaccinated against leptospirosis. </p>
<p> Can Dogs Eat Squirrels? </p>
<p> Dogs can eat squirrels, but they shouldn’t, in fact, as we have seen there are few risks related to eating squirrels especially if they are already dead. </p>
<p> Squirrels are bound to visit many places and eat many things and even if they don’t get poisoned, you never know what your dog might end up ingesting when they eat one. </p>
<p> That’s why if your dog ate a squirrel, the first thing to do is always to call the emergency hotline or a professional and ask how to proceed. </p>

<p> If you've never eaten an artichoke before, this strange vegetable may present some unique challenges when you finally try to prepare or eat one. The process for eating an artichoke is somewhat non-intuitive - the fruit can't be eaten in its raw form because its tough fibers and sharp leaf tips can wreak havoc on your digestive system. However, if approached correctly, an artichoke can be a delicious, healthy and unusual addition to nearly any meal. </p>
<p> Cut off the sharp leaf tips with an artichoke knife or scissors. This is optional, but it makes eating the artichoke "much" easier later on. </p>
<p> Don't boil the artichoke. Artichokes are steamed. You may place it in a few inches of water and bring the water to a low boil, but only a low boil, then cover. Do not cover them entirely, just a few inches. If you cover them too much with water they will turn brown. Steam for about 50 minutes. You will know when it is done when you can pierce the stem with a fork quite easily - it should feel like you are piercing a soft fruit. You can also microwave them, individually wrapped in plastic, for 8-15 minutes, or put them in a pressure cooker for 20 minutes. You know it is done when you pull at a leaf and it comes away with little resistance. </p>
<p> Take the outer leaves off one by one and hold like a potato chip. Take a look at it - you should be able to see the edible part pretty clearly. It's lighter in color and down at the base of the leaf, where it was attached to the heart. </p>
<p> Coat the tip (the part that was attached to the heart of the choke) in whatever dip has been offered. Some common dips are: </p>
<p> Mayonnaise (try mixing with a little bit of balsamic vinegar or soy sauce) </p>
<p> Gently nibble or scrape off the tender bits of the bottom of the leaf by putting the leaf in your mouth, closing your teeth on it, and pulling the leaf outwards. The "good part" will detach from the more woody, fibrous part of the leaf easily and leave the tasty bit for you to savor. </p>
<p> Continue until you get to the smaller center leaves that don't have much meatiness to them. These leaves look a bit different than the outer leaves and often have a translucent quality with a bit of purple on them. </p>
<p> Pull off the center leaves. Depending on how well-cooked the artichoke is, you can sometimes lift off the smaller inner leaves all together for one last dip in the sauces and bite the ends off delicately (but don't eat the sharp tips). They cover a finer, almost hairy growth just on top of the heart of the artichoke. Some people call this part the "choke," which is what you will do if you eat it, as it is very prickly. </p>
<p> Remove the choke using gentle strokes with a spoon. If cooked well, the choke will scrape off easily. What remains after the choke is removed is the coveted heart. Many people will try different implements, but a spoon is best and leaves a clear clean heart with no choke left on it. </p>
<p> Eat your heart out. The heart of the artichoke is the most prized portion and often the only part restaurant chefs use in their recipes, but at home you can savor the whole artichoke experience. Enjoy. </p>

<p> Community Q&A </p>
<p> Artichoke leaves have little spikes on the ends. Cutting these off will ensure that they don't prick you. Some people also find that cutting the tips off makes it easier to season the artichoke. </p>
<p> Artichokes are best grown in damp weather, with cool summer temperatures and mild winters. They are grown commercially in coastal areas of Northern California. Artichokes are perennials that can survive for up to 6 years in mild-winter areas. Northern gardeners can grow them as an annual by starting indoors early and then harvest in the fall. </p>
<p> Artichokes should be grown in areas with mild winters and cool summers, but they can be grown in other climates as well. </p>
<p> How do I eat artichokes from a jar? Are there any recipes? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> You can eat the whole thing as is. They are made from younger artichokes and prepared in such a way as to make the whole portion edible. They are nice with bread, and often eaten as a snack or as an appetizer with cured meats. </p>
<p> This is for all artichokes. You can just pick an artichoke and follow the directions! </p>
<p> Asparagus with a slight nutty flavor. It's rather like a cross between celery/citrus celeriac. </p>
<p> The 'choke' is an almost hairy growth just on top of the heart of the artichoke. It can cause you to choke if you aren't paying attention. </p>
<p> The whole artichoke plant is completely edible. You can cook it until it is soft enough to eat the leaves. </p>
<p> What is the ideal weight that the artichoke should reach before it's picked? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> It should be nearly a quarter to a half of a pound. You will also find that the spiked leaves reach all the way to the stem and even down the stem itself. </p>

<p> Tips </p>
<p> Make sure you provide a discard bowl, about one medium-sized bowl per two people, when serving the full cooked artichoke. </p>
<p> If you're not allergic to dairy, try artichoke with some Parmesan cheese. It tastes good! </p>
<p> Steaming artichoke in a large pot on a steaming rack with about an inch of water on medium will hold the flavor in more. </p>
<p> Chop up a clove of garlic and cook in a little EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) until golden brown, drain onto a paper towel, mix garlic pieces with some mayo...dipping sauce! </p>
<p> Don't discard the stem, as it can be nearly as tasty as the heart when cooked. Just take a look at it once it's cooked and cut off any really stringy or woody bits, and eat the rest with the heart! </p>
<p> Warnings </p>
<p> Don't confuse what's described here, a globe artichoke, with Jerusalem artichokes and Chinese artichokes, which are completely different plants from which the roots are eaten. </p>
<p> Do not put the discarded parts in the garbage disposal. Compost if possible; otherwise, simply deposit these in the garbage (or yard/food waste, if your trash removal provides this). </p>

<p> To eat an artichoke, start by steaming it for 50 minutes or microwaving it for 10 minutes. After you've cooked the artichoke, peel the outer leaves off and use your teeth to scrape off the tender, edible parts at the base of the leaves. Then, remove and discard the smaller, translucent leaves that are near the center of the artichoke and use a spoon to scrape off the prickly fibers that are beneath them. You'll be left with the artichoke heart, which you can eat as is or add to your favorite recipes. If you want to learn how to drain the artichoke after you cook it, keep reading the article! </p>

<p> Tooth pain can have many different causes, including tooth decay, sensitivity caused by acidic foods, and braces. No matter why your teeth hurt, it is likely to make eating hard foods a challenge. If you can't stick to your soft food diet any longer, there are a few tricks you can use to make hard foods easier to eat. </p>
<p> Chew more carefully. The easiest thing you can do to reduce the amount of pain you experience when eating hard foods is to be more careful about the way you chew. This is especially important if you plan on eating hard foods. </p>
<p> Chew very slowly to avoid causing sharp pain. </p>
<p> Avoid chewing with the affected teeth. For example, if the left side of your mouth is bothering you, try chewing all of your food on the right side until the pain subsides. </p>
<p> Cut your food into small pieces. Hard foods are even more difficult to chew when you put large pieces of them into your mouth at once. Make chewing easier for yourself by taking an extra moment to cut all of your food into smaller pieces. </p>
<p> Foods that you need to bite into with your front teeth, like whole apples, large carrots, and corn on the cob, are especially bad. Be sure to cut these to prevent more pain and damage to your teeth.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> Cook food thoroughly to soften it. Cooking food in specific ways can also help make it softer and easier to chew, which means you can still eat the foods you want while experiencing less pain.[2] X Expert Source Pradeep Adatrow, DDS, MS Board Certified Dentist & Oral Surgeon Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. The more tender the food, the less it will bother your teeth. </p>
<p> If you want to eat beef, consider preparing it in a slow cooker instead of grilling it. This will make it nice and tender, while still preserving the flavor. </p>
<p> Try eating steamed or sauteed vegetables instead of raw vegetables. </p>
<p> Puree or juice food. Another way to enjoy the foods you love without enduring pain is to puree or juice them. You'll still get all the flavor you were longing for, without the pain.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> For example, if you want to eat carrots, but your teeth are too sore, consider drinking some carrot juice or eating some carrot soup. </p>
<p> See a dentist for persistent pain. If your pain is severe or lasts for more than a few days, schedule an appointment with a dentist right away.[4] X Expert Source Pradeep Adatrow, DDS, MS Board Certified Dentist & Oral Surgeon Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. You may have tooth decay, a loose filling, or a cracked tooth, all of which need to be addressed by a dentist.[5] X Research source </p>
<p> If your pain is only occasional and not confined to a single spot, you probably have nothing to worry about, but you should still see your dentist regularly for cleanings. </p>
<p> The sooner you see a dentist, the less likely your problem is to become more serious, so don't put it off.[6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source </p>
<p> Try a night guard. If several of your teeth suddenly begin to ache, it may be caused by teeth grinding, which people often do in their sleep. Wearing a night guard to bed will prevent you from grinding your teeth, which should make the pain go away.[7] X Research source </p>
<p> If you are experiencing more stress in your life that you are used to, you may suddenly begin grinding your teeth. </p>
<p> Address sinus congestion. Intense sinus congestion can sometimes cause pain that is easy to confuse with a toothache because it compresses nerves that are very close to the roots of your upper teeth. If your teeth have only started hurting since you have been congested, consider taking an over-the-counter remedy to relieve your congestion. You may just find that your tooth pain goes away as well.[8] X Research source </p>
<p> If your congestion is persistent or accompanied by other symptoms, see a doctor. </p>
<p> Think about recent changes in your diet. If your teeth just suddenly started causing you pain, it may be due to a change in your eating habits. If you have added any new acidic foods into your diet (like citrus fruits, coffee, or tomato sauce), you may want to cut back on them. Acidic foods are known to break down tooth enamel, which can lead to pain and a variety of dental problems. </p>
<p> If you don't want to give up acidic foods, try to rinse your mouth out with water after you eat them. This will help prevent the acid from sticking around on your teeth after you've finished eating. </p>
<p> Take an over-the counter pain reliever. For severe pain, try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin. Be sure to always read the bottle and follow the dosing instructions carefully.[9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source </p>
<p> Try a cold compress. Place an ice pack on your face near the affected tooth. Hold it there for up to 15 minutes. This should temporarily alleviate swelling and pain, making it easier to eat normally.[10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source </p>
<p> If you don't have an ice pack, wrap some loose ice in a thin piece of paper or plastic. A bag of frozen vegetables will also work. </p>
<p> Try home remedies. Another way to temporarily relieve tooth pain so that you can eat the foods you want is to try using some natural home remedies. You may already have all of the ingredients you need to create one of these remedies in your kitchen. </p>
<p> Mix one teaspoon of warm mustard oil with a pinch of turmeric powder until it forms a paste. Apply to your sore tooth and let it sit for five minutes before rinsing your mouth with warm water. </p>
<p> Mix one teaspoon of asafoetida powder with a few drops on lemon juice until it becomes a paste. Apply to the tooth and let it sit for five minutes before rinsing your mouth with warm water. </p>
<p> Heat a teaspoon of coconut oil in a frying pan and fry three cloves in the oil. Take the pan off of the heat, let the mixture cool, and then grind it to create a paste. Apply it to your tooth and let it sit for up to ten minutes before rinsing your mouth with warm water. </p>

<p> If you want to eat hard foods when you have tooth pain, chew your food very slowly, and avoid chewing with the affected teeth if possible. Make large food like apples or large carrots easier to chew by cutting them into very small pieces before you eat, instead of using your teeth to take bites. You can also cook certain foods, like vegetables and meat, to make them softer and easier to chew. To avoid chewing some foods altogether, like fruits and veggies, use a blender or food processor to puree them into a juice.

<p> Important Tips for Eating and Drinking with Invisalign </p>
<p> As you look forward to starting Invisalign, you’ll probably think a lot about what your smile will look like when your treatment is done. </p>
<p> It’s exciting to imagine what it will feel like to have that perfect smile finally! But don’t forget that you’ll only get that new smile after spending many months in clear teeth aligners. </p>
<p> So while it’s fun (and motivational) to dream about your Invisalign results, you also need to think about what to expect during your treatment journey. </p>
<p> Diet is a critical concern during clear aligner treatment. After all, you’ll be wearing your aligners all day long, and you need to eat every day. </p>
<p> So how does Invisalign affect what you eat and drink? </p>
<p> As you peruse one Invisalign review after another, you’ll notice that most of them briefly talk about foods you can have during Invisalign treatment. </p>
<p> In this post, we’re dishing out all the delicious details to prepare you for eating with Invisalign. </p>
<p> Can You Eat with Invisalign in? </p>
<p> We’ll begin by addressing the big question: </p>
<p> Can you eat with Invisalign in your mouth? </p>
<p> The short answer is no. We’ll go into more detail in just a moment. </p>
<p> When comparing braces vs Invisalign, one of the biggest differences is that you can take Invisalign out whenever you have to eat. </p>
<p> Braces are stuck to your teeth until an orthodontist takes them off, so they’re going to be there at all times, whether you’re eating, drinking, or sleeping. But Invisalign aligners are removable, so you can take them out for meals and snacks. Not only that, but you’re supposed to remove them when you eat. </p>
<p> Can You Eat with Invisalign? </p>
<p> Eating with aligners is not recommended for two reasons: </p>
<p> Chewing on hard foods can damage your aligners. </p>
<p> Bits of food can get trapped between your Invisalign aligners and your teeth for hours. This kind of long-term food exposure can start eroding your enamel, which is the first step in the cavity formation process. </p>
<p> One of Invisalign’s best features is the fact that you can take out the aligners when you eat. This means you’re free to eat whatever you want as long as the aligners are out. </p>
<p> Can You Drink with Invisalign? </p>
<p> You can relax the no-eating-with-Invisalign rule a bit for beverages since you don’t have to chew liquids. </p>
<p> Although it’s generally safe to sip on a drink without having to remove your aligners, there are a few caveats: </p>
<p> You should avoid sipping on hot beverages since the heat can warp oral appliances like clear aligners. </p>
<p> You may wish to avoid dark-colored drinks that can stain your clear aligners. </p>
<p> Sweetened and/or alcoholic drinks can encourage the growth of cavity-causing bacteria and enamel-eating acids on your teeth below the aligners, so avoid sugary beverages. </p>
<p> If your drink has small solid pieces that can get stuck under your aligners (like boba tea tapioca balls, seeds, and fibers in smoothies, etc.), then you should take your aligners out to enjoy the drink. </p>
<p> After reading all of those limitations, you’re probably wondering: </p>
<p> At the very least, can I drink water with Invisalign? </p>
<p> Yes, you are good to drink water with Invisalign! In fact, plain water is the only drink that’s safe for Invisalign. </p>
<p> Invisalign Instructions: How To Eat with Invisalign </p>
<p> Eating with Invisalign couldn’t get any easier: simply take out your aligners and chow down! </p>
<p> With your aligners out, you’ll be able to chew on any foods you wish. </p>
<p> The most important thing to remember here is that you need to put your aligners in a safe place when you take them out for meals and snacks. </p>
<p> NEVER wrap your aligners in a napkin or leave them on a food tray. It’s way too easy to toss them out by accident if you do that. Instead, keep your Invisalign aligner case with you wherever you go and put them in it. </p>
<p> The case will keep your aligners clean, safe, and easy to locate when you’re done eating. </p>
<p> After the meal, you’ll just pop your Invisalign aligners right back in and go about your day. </p>
<p> The Invisalign Diet: What Foods Are and Are Not Allowed </p>
<p> Is there any food or drink prohibited during Invisalign treatment? </p>
<p> Technically, no. </p>
<p> As long as your aligners are out of your mouth, you can eat anything you normally would. There aren’t any off-limits foods like there are for braces. </p>
<p> But in just a minute, we’re going to explain why you may want to make some adjustments to your diet anyway while wearing Invisalign. </p>
<p> Can You Drink Coffee with Invisalign? </p>
<p> It’s best to avoid drinking coffee while wearing Invisalign. </p>
<p> A few sips of hot coffee can make your aligner soften and change shape, as we discussed earlier. Invisalign aligners are precisely designed to fit your teeth in a very specific way. If that fit is altered by coming in contact with a piping-hot beverage, then the aligner will stop working, and you’ll have to get a new one. </p>
<p> The same goes for drinking tea with Invisalign. Hot teas can warp your aligners, and even cold teas can cause discoloration because they often contain pigments. </p>
<p> Your best bet is to remove your aligners before eating anything except plain water! </p>
<p> Tips for Eating with Invisalign </p>
<p> When wearing regular braces, you have to be very careful about what you eat since you don’t want to snap any wires. </p>
<p> Invisalign treatment is much less fussy; all you have to do is take out your aligners every time you eat or drink something. </p>
<p> However, there are some other things you can do to make sure your Invisalign treatment is successful. </p>
<p> Reduce Your Coffee Consumption </p>
<p> In case you didn’t get the memo by yet, we’ll repeat it: Invisalign and coffee do not mix. If you have a habit of sipping on a couple of (read: four) coffees throughout the day, now may be a good time to cut back. You shouldn’t drink coffee while wearing your aligners. And you definitely shouldn’t leave your aligners out of your mouth for hours on end while you drink your coffee. Try to limit your coffee consumption to mealtimes only. This way, you can enjoy your java fix while your aligners are already out. </p>
<p> Brush Your Teeth Frequently </p>
<p> Daily oral hygiene is an extremely important aspect of your Invisalign treatment. Cleaning your teeth after each meal (before putting your aligners back in) will keep your teeth healthy and prevent food residue from staining your aligners. If your brushing or flossing routine could use some improvement, then do that now before starting treatment with clear aligners. Ask your dentist for personalized oral hygiene instructions and advice. Make it a habit to clean your teeth daily, and it will be easier to maintain that habit later while wearing Invisalign. </p>
<p> Don’t Eat While Wearing Invisalign </p>
<p> Wearing Invisalign is easy and convenient, for the most part. But once in a while, you might find yourself in a situation where it could be socially off-putting to take out your orthodontic aligners in front of others. It could be tempting to act like you aren’t wearing Invisalign and eat with your aligners, anyway. Don’t take chances. If you are planning to attend an event where you’ll be eating around others, and you don’t everyone to see you take out your Invisalign aligners, just leave them at home for that one event. </p>
<p> Avoid Food Dyes with Invisalign </p>
<p> Some patients have reported that their Invisalign aligners turned funny colors after eating foods with strong colorants in them. Boxed macaroni and cheese with its bright orange-colored cheese powder, for example, or curries and other foods with the spice turmeric can also discolor your aligners if you don’t carefully clean your mouth after eating. </p>
<p> Clean Invisalign Retainers Daily </p>
<p> Whether you’re wearing the aligner trays that move your teeth or the retainers that help save your progress, you need to clean your Invisalign appliance every day. Check with your dentist or orthodontist if you aren't sure how to clean Invisalign trays. </p>
<p> Rinse your retainer with warm water after each meal </p>
<p> Brush your retainer with a soft toothbrush to remove stubborn debris </p>
<p> Use gentle dish soap to clean your retainer. </p>
<p> Soak your retainer in a denture cleaning solution or an Invisalign tray cleaning solution </p>
<p> No Gum Chewing! </p>
<p> Gum chewing is a big no-no with Invisalign. It can very quickly unseat your trays and get stuck in all the little tooth-shaped grooves. You could damage your aligner trying to get all the gum off, and any left residue can attract more debris. Just like coffee and any other food, enjoy a piece of chewing gum while your Invisalign trays are out of your mouth. </p>
<p> Plan Your Meals to Avoid Snacking </p>
<p> You don’t have to go on a diet with Invisalign. But you do have to maintain excellent oral hygiene while wearing clear aligner trays, so it may be best to keep your snacking to a minimum. Carefully planning your meals for each day or even on a weekly basis can help you resist the urge to snack. </p>
<p> Getting used to Invisalign takes a little time and may require a couple of changes in your eating habits. But once you see that new smile, you’ll definitely agree that it was all worth it! </p>

<p> Many people have faced the problem of having to eat something that they absolutely hate. It might be due to flavor, texture, personal preferences or dietary beliefs. Whatever the cause, if you really have to eat that hateful piece of food, here's how to get it down (and with any luck, keep it down too). </p>
<p> Pretend that the food before you is a food you really like. For example, pretend it's mushed-up cheeseburger or blended ice cream. Be creative in your imagined change to your usual favorite food type and then just go for it. </p>
<p> Pretend it's just weird candy. So if it's sugar-coated ants, just pretend it's sugar-coated candy. </p>
<p> Try not to think about it. Do not stare at the food, sniff the food or indulge in thinking about it. Instead, just focus on the fact that you need to eat, that a meal is present and that there are some great things to be getting on with after eating. </p>
<p> Come up with distracting thoughts, such as things you can't wait to be doing, favorite games you enjoy playing or destinations you'd like to visit. </p>
<p> Psych yourself to eat it. Tell yourself that the food is just fine and that you're going to be fine too. Tell yourself: "I can do this. If I eat this, I am a superhero." </p>
<p> Think about starving people. Okay, it's depressing but it will remind you that there are people who are going without while you're fussing about the food. </p>
<p> Remember that what is "foul" when it comes to food is often personal. There are some foods that do smell bad to most people, such as stinky tofu and cod-based lutefisk, or stinky cheeses but many other food odors are fairly much tailored to your own experience. For example, a vegetarian might find the odor of meat unappealing, while a non-gourmet cheese lover might detest the odor of blue cheese. </p>
<p> Hold your nose when eating. This might help to reduce the odor. </p>
<p> Open the windows and let a nice, fresh breeze flow through. Sometimes the build-up of strong odor is what makes you feel sick, and if air flow can dissipate this, it might help you manage to eat the food... just. </p>
<p> Avoid sniffing the food or being too close to it for too long if you can't stand its odor. </p>
<p> Avoid chewing if you can't abide the texture. Instead, cut the food into tiny bits that are safe to swallow quickly, then toss them down your gullet as fast as you can. Wash them down with water, juice or a beer. </p>
<p> If you don't like it because it's slimy or squashy, eat it without putting it on your tongue. </p>
<p> Hide the food inside something else. This is a great way of hiding bad tastes or horrible textures. If it's swimming or tucked inside some food that you do like, it'll be much easier to get it down. </p>
<p> If you're the chef, even better. Be creative and find ways of hiding the foul food well and truly deep inside your baked or cooked concoction. Shave/grate/chop/peel, etc. the food to minute size and hide away. </p>
<p> Strong seasonings might help make the food's flavor "disappear" when eaten. </p>
<p> Blend it into a drink. Add juice, milk or other liquids that you do like and a dollop of sweet or savory flavoring, then gulp it all down. </p>
<p> Chase it up with delicious food. Eat the offending food first. This gets it out of the way. Then bombard your taste buds with food that you really do like. The more of the delicious food you finish up with, the more the offending item will be but a foul memory. </p>
<p> Tell the chef or cook that you're allergic to the food. This is hard to refute unless you're at home with family who knows better. Even then, if you're visiting from interstate after being away some time, tell them you've since developed an allergy. </p>
<p> Tell the chef or cook that you're on a special diet. This could be anything from gluten-free to fruitarian. </p>
<p> Tell people that you tried it once and found it not to your liking. And state that you categorically refused to ever eat it again. </p>
<p> You will probably need to be over 16 or so to get away with this one. </p>
<p> Hand it to a sibling or parent who adores the food. Plant a big smile on your face and make a show of saying how much you know they love the food and you're letting them have some more. It probably won't work but you'll make your point well and truly. </p>
<p> Find a pot plant. Shove said awful food into the soil and hope all goes unnoticed. </p>
<p> Hide the food inside your napkin/serviette. Without being seen, slide the offending food into the outdoor garbage disposal late at night. </p>
<p> Feed it to the dog. Only do this if the food is safe for the dog to eat and you don't mind creating a bad habit (dogs should not learn to eat from the human plate or table). </p>

<p> Community Q&A </p>
<p> What if I don't want to eat it but my parents force me to? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Just close your eyes and tell yourself that you have gotten through many things before and this is just a small obstacle you need to cross and gulp the food down. </p>
<p> My parents are making me eat vegetables and other stuff because I'm doing sports. I don't really hate vegetables but I'm not very fond of them either. Is there a way to like make them less bland? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Ask them to put the veggies in to a flavorful soup or to add more spices. Usually just sauteing them with some salt and fat (olive oil, butter, etc.) makes them far more appetizing. Use condiments like mustard, vinegar, pepper, lime juice, etc. to add more taste. </p>
<p> I get very anxious about going with my dad to aunt Nancy's because she makes weird concoctions, like once we had this lemon jello dessert. I hate jello. How can I reduce my anxiety? </p>
<p> Audrey </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Just tell yourself that you have been through worse things in your life. If you really don't like it, just come clean, she probably won't be mad. Remember, you will only be eating for a bit, and it might not be as bad as you think. </p>
<p> Tips </p>
<p> If it's a pizza or a corn dog or something but there are bad toppings, just pretend it's the regular version. </p>
<p> Try to match features from the bad food to the good food. For example, if you had to eat a worm, pretend it's a gummy worm. </p>
<p> Warnings </p>
<p> Sometimes your aversion may have other reasons; if it's ruining your life, seek counseling. </p>

<p> German Verb Conjugations of Essen (To Eat) </p>
<p> Hyde Flippo taught the German language for 28 years at high school and college levels and published several books on the German language and culture. </p>
<p> No matter where you are in the world one thing will always be true, everyone loves to eat! Most people never want to accidentally say they've eaten when they haven't but if you don't use the proper verb tense that's just the kind of mistake you can make. Learning all the ways to conjugate the word essen or to eat can help you never miss a meal in Germany. </p>
<p> Stem-Changing Verbs </p>
<p> Essen is a regular stem-changing verb. German, like many other languages, has these stem-changing verbs. This means that the stem or ending of the word is what changes based on who the action is referring to. These endings will remain consistent throughout the language for regular stem-changing verbs. Unlike in English, where I take and we take uses the same form of the verb; in German, the stems of the verb would change. This can make learning the language easier because you only need to remember the roots of most verbs. Verbs that are irregular will not follow these rules or will only follow them some of the time. Thankfully essen is one of these regular verbs. </p>

<p> What to Do If You Eat Before a Blood Test That Requires Fasting </p>
<p> A fasting blood test requires you to avoid eating or drinking anything for some time before your test. The amount of time to fast varies for different tests. It’s generally in the range of 8 to 12 hours. </p>
<p> Fasting allows a doctor to get accurate readings for measurements that are influenced by the food you eat, such as your blood sugar levels or cholesterol levels. </p>
<p> If you accidentally ate before a fasting blood test, you should let your healthcare provider know right away so that you don’t receive incorrectly interpreted results. </p>
<p> In some cases, you may still be able to receive your test as scheduled, but in other cases, you may need to move your test to a different day. </p>
<p> Let’s look at why fasting is necessary for some tests, what type of tests require fasting, and what you can do to make the fasting process easier. </p>
<p> Some blood tests require you to fast because the results can be easily influenced by the foods that you eat. The micronutrient, carbohydrate, protein, and fat levels in your food can all skew the results of some tests. </p>
<p> An example of a test that requires fasting is a blood glucose test, which measures your blood sugar levels. Eating foods high in carbohydrates can significantly raise your blood sugar levels within 15 minutes. </p>
<p> The following are some types of blood tests that require fasting in at least some circumstances: </p>
<p> The amount of time you need to fast depends on the type of test you’re receiving. A doctor will tell you how long you should abstain from eating. </p>
<p> Blood glucose test. A fasting blood glucose test usually requires an overnight fast that lasts for about 8 to 10 hours. </p>
<p> Blood cholesterol test. Some types of cholesterol tests don’t require fasting. Some like a direct LDL cholesterol test may require up to a 14-hour fast. </p>
<p> Triglyceride level test. You likely won’t need to fast for a triglyceride test, but a 12-hour fast may be required in some situations. </p>
<p> Serum iron test. You may be requested to fast for 12 hours and to avoid taking iron supplements for 24 hours before this test. </p>
<p> Vitamin B12 tests. You’re often not required to fast before a vitamin B12 test. In some situations, a doctor may recommend a fast that’s about 6 to 8 hours. </p>
<p> Vitamin B complex test. A blood test looking at all your B vitamins is typically performed the morning after an overnight fast. </p>
<p> Renal function panel. You may be told to fast for 8 to 12 hours before a renal function test. </p>
<p> Gamma-glutamyl transferase test. A doctor may instruct you to fast overnight and avoid alcohol for 24 hours. </p>
<p> If you break your fast, the results of your test may be inaccurate. You can call your doctor to see if the test can still be done. </p>
<p> Some tests may be still be analyzed knowing that you’re not in a fasted state. It’s important to be honest with the test administrator so they can interpret your results properly. Some types of tests may need to be rescheduled. </p>
<p> There are many conditions a doctor might want to test for using a fasting blood test. Just three of many examples include diabetes, high cholesterol, or low iron. </p>
<p> The following early symptoms may indicate you have one of these conditions: </p>
<p> Many types of blood tests don’t require you to fast. A healthcare provider will let you know if, and for how long, you need to avoid eating. </p>
<p> For all types of blood tests, including fasting tests, you can still drink plain water. You should avoid other drinks like coffee, tea, juices, and alcoholic beverages. </p>
<p> The following tips may help make fasting for your blood test easier: </p>
<p> Stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water before your test makes your blood vessels easier to find. </p>
<p> Schedule a morning test. If your blood test is in the morning, you’ll likely only need to skip one meal. </p>
<p> Eat before fasting. Eating directly before your fasting window reduces the amount of time you need to avoid food. For example, if your test is at 9 a.m. and you need to fast for 12 hours, you may want to eat your last meal around 8:30 p.m. the night before. </p>
<p> Avoid exercising during your fast. Exercise speeds up digestion and causes you to burn extra calories. </p>
<p> Keep yourself distracted. Keeping yourself busy may help take your mind off your hunger. </p>
<p> You can eat and drink immediately following your blood test. You’ll likely be hungry after fasting, so you may want to pack a snack with you to eat directly after your test. </p>
<p> Some blood tests require you to fast in order for your healthcare provider to get an accurate reading. </p>
<p> If you eat during your fast, you should let your doctor know so they can decide if you should reschedule. In some cases, you may still be able to have your test at the scheduled time. </p>

<p> Intermittent Fasting: What You Can Eat & Drink During a Fast </p>
<p> “I’m doing Intermittent Fasting. What can I eat and drink during my fast?” </p>
<p> “Can I eat/drink [insert food/drink] during my fast?” </p>
<p> “Does x number of calories break a fast?” </p>
<p> “Will drinking BCAAs break my fast?” </p>
<p> “Do artificial sweeteners break a fast?” </p>
<p> All these are commonly asked questions by people who engage in different types of intermittent fasting, whether that’s alternate day fasting, the Lean Gains protocol, 5:2, and so on. And all are perfectly valid questions to ask, mind you. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, however, the answers to the questions above are a little more complicated and less straightforward than you may think. Don’t you worry, though, because, by the end of this article, your questions will be answered! </p>
<p> By the way, big shout out to the IF Facebook group, if that’s what brought you here! </p>
<p> Key takeaway points </p>
<p> If you’re in a rush and don’t have time to go through the entire article, here are some of the key takeaways: </p>
<p> Intermittent fasting is, essentially, an eating pattern which involves alternating periods of little or no energy intake (i.e. caloric restriction) with intervening periods of normal food intake, on a recurring basis. </p>
<p> There are three types of intermittent fasting: alternate day fasting (ADF), whole day fasting (WDF), and time-restricted feeding (TRF). </p>
<p> Fasting can mean one of two things: 1. completely abstaining from food, and 2. eating sparingly or abstaining from some foods. </p>
<p> Different people fast for different reasons, including to lose weight, to improve their health, to test their mental toughness, and for religious reasons. </p>
<p> Fat loss is the result of a caloric deficit. According to research, when calories and protein are controlled for, fasting per se doesn’t seem to increase fat or weight loss. This means that you don’t, technically, have to fast to maximize fat loss, which makes the question of what you can eat or drink during a fast when your goal is fat loss kind of irrelevant to begin with. </p>
<p> Most research on intermittent fasting for improved health and longevity suffers from serious methodological limitations. What we currently know from research is that there MAY be health and longevity benefits to fasting, but that there is, currently, no strong evidence from research in humans in the absence of caloric restriction to support this. This also makes the question of what you can eat or drink during a fast when your goal is better health and longevity kind of irrelevant to begin with. </p>
<p> Despite the above, there are still good reasons why you should try intermittent fasting, such as better caloric control, improved hunger awareness, the ability to have bigger and more satisfying meals, more social flexibility, potentially improved sustainability and better dietary adherence, and improved productivity during the fasted state. </p>
<p> A good general rule is that ingesting calories breaks a fast. While a splash of milk or cream in your coffee will, technically, break your fast, it won’t interfere with your results as long as those calories are accounted for. </p>
<p> BCAA products (all of them, despite what the nutritional label on the product says) contain calories and will break your fast. </p>
<p> Okay, so let’s get right into it! </p>
<p> What is Intermittent Fasting? </p>
<p> Before we talk about what you can eat during a fast, let’s first briefly explain what intermittent fasting is. </p>
<p> Simply put, intermittent fasting is, essentially, an eating pattern which involves alternating periods of little or no energy intake (i.e. caloric restriction) with intervening periods of normal food intake, on a recurring basis. </p>
<p> There are, generally, three different types of intermittent fasting according to research: </p>
<p> Alternate day fasting (ADF), which involves a 24-hour fasting or very low calorie period, alternated with a 24-hour ad libitum eating period. </p>
<p> Whole day fasting (WDF), which usually involves 1-2 days of fasting or very low calorie periods per week, with the remaining days of the week eating at maintenance. </p>
<p> Time-restricted feeding (TRF), which involves a fasting period of 16–20 hours and a feeding period of 4–8 hours daily, and includes the Leangains protocol by Martin Berkhan. This is probably the most popular of the three types of intermittent fasting. </p>
<p> An example of a TRF protocol is as follows: you may set your fasting period to be from 10 pm on one day until 4 pm on the following day. This gives you 18 hours of fasting and an eating window of 6 hours (from 4 pm until 10 pm every day). This is known as the 18:6 protocol among those practicing intermittent fasting. </p>
<p> Other protocols are 14:10 (fasting for 14 hours), 16:8 (fasting for 16 hours), 20:4 (fasting for 20 hours) and so on. </p>
<p> Which leads us to our next question. </p>
<p> What exactly is fasting? </p>
<p> As you can understand, since fasting can, technically, mean both completely abstaining from food AND eating a little/not eating some foods, we’re in a bit of a pickle. </p>
<p> Remember when, at the start of this article, we said that things are not as straightforward as you may think? Well, this is partly why. </p>
<p> Hold your horses, though, because this is going to get a little more complicated. </p>
<p> Why would someone fast in the first place? </p>
<p> The motives behind why people fast are also something important to consider when trying to decide what you can eat and drink during a fast, as this can affect what you are technically “allowed” to have. </p>
<p> So why do people fast? </p>
<p> Well, different people fast for different reasons, the most common ones being: </p>
<p> to lose fat and weight, </p>
<p> to improve their health and increase longevity, </p>
<p> for religious reasons, and </p>
<p> to test their “mental toughness”. </p>
<p> What you can eat and drink during a fast </p>
<p> Okay, so let’s consider the reasons we listed above for why people fast and try to figure what you can eat and drink during your fast for each of these reasons. </p>
<p> 1. Fasting for fat loss and weight loss </p>
<p> To answer the question of what you can eat and drink during your fast when your primary goal is weight loss, we must first consider how fasting helps with weight loss in the first place. </p>
<p> In short, the general line of thinking goes like this: When doing IF, the fasting periods result in lower insulin levels and higher human growth (HGH) hormone levels which, in turn, cause increased fat burning and, consequently, weight loss. </p>
<p> Is this, however, an accurate description of what happens? Well, according to scientific research, it’s true that, when we fast, our insulin levels drop and our HGH levels increase. What does research show, however, with regards to the end result, i.e. actual fat and weight loss? Do fasting-related lower insulin levels and higher growth hormone levels really result in more fat loss? </p>
<p> With regards to insulin, we can look at research comparing low carb/ketogenic diets with energy- and protein-matched higher carb diets for the answer, since these were designed to examine whether insulin per se plays a key role in fat loss. In short, a number of well-controlled studies such as this metabolic ward study, this metabolic ward study and this meta analysis provide good evidence to support the idea that low carbohydrate diets and ketogenic diets don’t seem to work better for fat loss when caloric and protein intakes are controlled for. </p>
<p> With regards to human growth hormone, research on intermittent fasting can shed some light. In short, studies that have compared intermittent fasting approaches to continuous energy restriction while controlling for caloric and protein intakes, such as this one, this one, and this one, have shown that, overall, the two diet types result in identical outcomes in terms of body weight and body fat reduction. </p>
<p> Why is that, however? If lower insulin levels and higher growth hormone levels aren’t the reasons why intermittent fasting works for fat loss, then how does intermittent fasting work? </p>
<p> And this is, essentially, how intermittent fasting (and every other diet approach) works for weight loss – by helping you eat less, overall. </p>
<p> So where does this leave us with regards to what you can eat and drink during your fast? </p>
<p> Well, in reality, if your only goal is weight (and fat) loss, you can technically eat and drink anything you want at any time of the day, provided that you are maintaining a caloric deficit. </p>
<p> Eating throughout the day, of course, means that you won’t be doing intermittent fasting. And, yes, this means that you don’t HAVE TO do intermittent fasting if it isn’t practical for you and if it doesn’t help you adhere to your diet. </p>
<p> Remember, intermittent fasting is merely a meal timing tool which is supposed to help you control your caloric intake. </p>
<p> Take home point: </p>
<p> If your primary goal is to lose weight, the answer to the question “can I eat/drink [whatever] during my fast?” is “you can, technically, do whatever you want, as long as you are maintaining a caloric deficit consistently over time. </p>
<p> However, if you are consuming foods/drinks with calories, you wouldn’t be fasting. But it doesn’t really matter, since it’s not the fasting per se that causes fat and weight loss, but, instead, the fact that intermittent fasting helps most people eat less overall.” </p>
<p> 2. Fasting for better health </p>
<p> Next on our list is fasting for better health. </p>
<p> Okay, so you don’t, technically, have to fast to lose weight, but fasting can improve health and increase longevity, right? After all, scientific research has shown that fasting results in a number of health benefits, including: </p>
<p> Well, unfortunately, if you take a closer look at the studies most health blogs usually cite, you will realize that the available scientific research suffers from a number of serious methodological problems, including that it is mostly limited to: </p>
<p> animal studies – a number of systematic reviews such as this one, this one, this one, this one, and this one, have demonstrated poor clinical utility of animal experimentation, </p>
<p> in vitro studies – i.e. with microorganisms or cells outside their normal biological context, usually in a test tube or petri dish, </p>
<p> mechanistic studies – i.e. studies discussing how one thing might affect another, but not actually trying it and seeing it happen in real life, and </p>
<p> studies that don’t control for caloric intake – caloric restriction and weight loss have been shown to have a multitude of health and anti-aging benefits in countless of studies. Since intermittent fasting tends to result in caloric restriction, it’s difficult to attribute the health benefits found to fasting per se, when there is the confounding variable of energy balance. </p>
<p> In short, what we currently know from research is that there MAY be health and longevity benefits to fasting without caloric restriction, but that there is, currently, no strong evidence from research in humans to support this. </p>
<p> “But this article/study says that fasting has health benefits”. </p>
<p> Okay, before you rush to any conclusions, investigate further! </p>
<p> Don’t just accept what the news website reports or what the abstract of a study says as facts just because they tell you what you want to hear. More often than not, claims are, at best, exaggerated by news websites, while study abstracts usually don’t tell the full story. </p>
<p> Remember to check the four points above, i.e. that the study referenced: </p>
<p> is not in animals, </p>
<p> is not in vitro, </p>
<p> is not mechanistic in nature, and </p>
<p> that it controls for energy intake. </p>
<p> So where do the above us with regards to what you can eat and drink during your fast when fasting for increased health and longevity? </p>
<p> Well, simply put, focusing on just fasting to improve your health is missing the forest for the trees, since it doesn’t look like it’s fasting per se that has health benefits but, instead, the overall decrease in energy intake as well as the accompanied fat loss. </p>
<p> Take home point: </p>
<p> Fasting MAY have some health benefits, but there is no strong scientific evidence to support this yet, so don’t stress about x food/drink breaking your fast or not. Remember that there are a few things that you can do that are much more important than fasting. </p>
<p> If you want to improve your health, make sure that, above all, you are: </p>
<p> maintaining a healthy weight, </p>
<p> eating a diet that is based on plants, lean proteins and healthy fats, </p>
<p> not drinking excessively, </p>
<p> not stressing, and </p>
<p> 3 & 4. Fasting for religious reasons and to test mental toughness </p>
<p> Fasting for these reasons is more of a personal matter and beyond the scope of this article. If your religion says that you have to completely abstain from foods for so many hours or from some foods for so many days, it’s entirely up to you to decide whether you want to do it or not. </p>
<p> The same applies to fasting for mental toughness. If you want to test your limits and see how long you can fast for, it’s your decision to make. </p>
<p> Just bear in mind that prolonged fasts can be dangerous and should, preferably, be done under the close supervision of a licenced health professional. </p>
<p> Why do Intermittent Fasting then? </p>
<p> So if fasting per se isn’t what results in weight loss and health improvements, why then do intermittent fasting in the first place? </p>
<p> Well, although fasting doesn’t seem to have any “magical” properties in and of itself, there are a number of good reasons why you should consider doing intermittent fasting! This is, after all, why we often use this approach with many of our online fitness coaching clients! </p>
<p> 1. More structured eating </p>
<p> How often have you found yourself mindlessly snacking between meals? A couple of cookies with your coffee, a small piece of cake that Suzy brought for her birthday at work, a few nuts and dried fruits before dinner, some popcorn with a movie at night. When you think about it, little snacks here and there can add up to quite a few calories. Well, the more structured eating that is a result of intermittent fasting can eliminate this problem and can help people better control their diet. </p>
<p> 2. Bigger, more satisfying meals </p>
<p> Eating every 2-3 hours sucks. For one, it’s impractical and makes you think of food all day. It also means that you never really get to eat big meals, especially if you are a smaller, physically inactive person. On the other hand, more infrequent meals that are larger in volume and provide more calories are usually much more satisfying and may help you feel fuller for longer. </p>
<p> 3. Sustainability and adherence </p>
<p> Diets that control calories over the long term lead to weight loss success. Eating larger meals less frequently usually tends to increase adherence to the diet over the long haul. </p>
<p> 4. Social Flexibility </p>
<p> Humans are social creatures and most of us nowadays tend to build social occasions around food, with these occasion usually taking place in the evening. By fasting throughout the day, you enable yourself the freedom to eat the foods served at social gatherings while still staying within your calorie goals for the day. Remember, a diet that doesn’t promote social flexibility is really hard to maintain. </p>
<p> 5. Improved hunger awareness </p>
<p> When eating throughout the day, it’s not uncommon to eat for reasons other than hunger. For example, many people tend to eat because of boredom, sadness, stress, or happiness. Also, even the smell of food can make us think we’re hungry and cause us to want to eat (walk by a bakery and listen to your stomach growl!). Well, fasting can help improve hunger awareness, making you realize what real physical hunger feels like and how to differentiate it to “hunger” arising from environmental or psychological factors. </p>
<p> 6. More productivity </p>
<p> Since eating takes up time, having fewer meals can often help people get more stuff done during the day, thereby, increasing productivity. </p>
<p> Let’s recap </p>
<p> Okay, so with all the above in mind, let’s recap and try to answer all the questions asked at the beginning of the article. </p>
<p> “I’m doing Intermittent Fasting. What can I eat and drink during my fast?” </p>
<p> If you are doing intermittent fasting to lose fat and weight, you can technically eat and drink whatever you want at any time of the day, provided that you are maintaining a sustained caloric deficit over the long term. This means that IF may help you lose fat if it makes it easier for you to reduce overall energy intake, but that you don’t HAVE TO do IF to lose fat and weight. </p>
<p> If you are doing IF for the purported health and longevity benefits of fasting, you may be disappointed to hear that we don’t know for certain if these exist in humans yet. There are a few things you can do that will have a much larger impact on your health anyway, such as maintaining a healthy body weight, eating a diet that is based primarily on plants, lean meats, fish and healthy fats, exercising, not smoking, not drinking excessively, not stressing too much, and maintaining healthy social relationships, so it’s a better idea to focus your energy on these instead. </p>
<p> “Can I eat/drink [insert food/drink] during my fast?” </p>
<p> Does eating/drinking that food or drink make it easier for you to improve your overall diet in terms of better food quality and lower calorie intake? If yes, go for it. If no, don’t. </p>
<p> “Does x number of calories break a fast?” </p>
<p> There’s no set number of calories that breaks a fast. The person who first came up with this probably did so to allow people to have a splash of milk or cream in their coffee without stressing about it, but to also keep them from going overboard with the calories and not managing to create a caloric deficit by the end of the day. </p>
<p> “Will drinking BCAAs break my fast?” </p>
<p> Despite what most people think (and what the nutritional info label on your BCAA product says) ALL BCAA products contain calories. Leucine and isoleucine contain 4.65 calories per gram, while valine contains 4.64 calories per gram. With the typical 2:1:1 ratio of most BCAA products, this means that 10g of BCAAs contain around 46.5 calories. </p>
<p> So yes, BCAAs break your fast. However, it doesn’t really matter if they do or don’t in the first place. </p>
<p> “Do artificial sweeteners break a fast?” </p>
<p> Artifical sweeteners contain, practically, no calories, so they don’t break a fast. For example, a typical can of aspartame-sweetened soda contains less than half a calorie. </p>
<p> Also, contrary to what many people think, artificial sweeteners don’t cause insulin secretion (diabetics would be dropping dead everywhere if this was the case) or somehow make you gain fat or weight (the association between artificial sweetener consumption and obesity in research doesn’t imply causation – it most likely means that people who are overweight tend to switch to diet soda in an effort to lose weight). </p>

<p> As you will notice, the studies were done on mice and, unfortunately, nutrition and supplementation research almost never translates well from mice to humans. </p>
<p> Here’s a quote from our article: </p>
<p> “You see, although it has been claimed multiple times that fasting can improve health and increase longevity, the research showing these benefits is limited to: </p>
<p> – animal studies (which 99.9% of the time don’t translate to humans in drug/nutrition/supplementation research) – in vitro studies (i.e. in a test tube) – mechanistic studies (i.e. studies discussing how one thing might affect another, but not actually trying it and seeing it happen in real life) – studies that don’t control for caloric intake (caloric restriction and weight loss have been shown to have a multitude of health benefits in countless of studies)” </p>
<p> Anyone who watched interviews on Dr Longo (or read his book on the fasting mimicking diet) the medical scientist who conducted early clinical studies on intermittent fasting using mice and humans he explains how the body and cells reacts to fasting and refeeding and the benefits will know that the concept for their studies was not based on the dictionary’s definition of fasting but rather on cellular changes that occurs when the body is in the fasting stage but more importantly the refeeding phase that generates weight loss and a multitude of health benefits. </p>
<p> It’s funny that you are mentioning Valter, as I have read pretty much all of his research on fasting 🙂 </p>
<p> What I would encourage you to do is to read his actual research rather than just listen to podcasts and interviews, as the former goes through a peer-review process which ensures that he is less likely to make exaggerations that can easily be made outside of the peer-review process. </p>
<p> If you focus on the research that is in humans, you’ll notice that the effects of IF can’t really be separated from those of caloric restriction. As we’ve mentioned in the article above, “caloric restriction and weight loss have been shown to have a multitude of health and anti-aging benefits in countless of studies. Since intermittent fasting tends to result in caloric restriction, it’s difficult to attribute the health benefits found to fasting per se, when there is the confounding variable of energy balance.” </p>
<p> Here are a few quotes from the study that you may find interesting: </p>
<p> On insulin sensitivity: “Thus, IF has been reported to have variable effects on peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity which may be different in obese and normal weight subjects and may be gender-specific. Further studies are required using more robust measures of insulin sensitivity e.g. insulin clamp or other techniques.” </p>
<p> On cardiovascular disease: “However, there have been few studies that have evaluated the relative effects of IF and Continuous Energy Restriction on cardiovascular risk markers. The randomized comparisons of IF and Continuous Energy Restriction have reported equivalent reductions in blood pressure (Hill et al., 1989a; Harvie et al., 2011, 2013a) and triglycerides (Hill et al., 1989a), (Ash et al., 2003). (Harvie et al., 2011, 2013a), and increased LDL particle size (Varady et al., 2011).” </p>
<p> On cancer risk: “Thus, although limited,the available biomarker data suggest that IF leads to comparable changes in most cancer risk biomarkers to Continuous Energy Restriction, with the possible exceptions of insulin resistance and adiponectin which require further study using robust methodologies. ” </p>
<p> Caloric restriction itself induces autophagy. In fact, it may be that the reason fasting induces autophagy is because it usually results in a decrease in energy intake. </p>
<p> Animal studies 99.9% don’t translate to humans in drug/nutrition/supplementation research? That’s an extremely high failure rate. I’m assuming this figure was pulled from a peer-reviewed journal, since it’s such an exact value? Would you mind posting a link to the source in which you pulled this figure from? Much appreciated! </p>
<p> That was, indeed, an exaggerated statement on our part, and it has been edited to be more accurate. </p>
<p> I am curious if you have had a chance to look at some of the studies that claim fasting can: – Decrease insulin resistance – Increase HGH levels – Increase testosterone levels – Increase sirtuin production </p>
<p> Are they founded? Has calorie control been known to trigger these same effects? </p>
<p> Also, you address fat-loss but are vague to what that entails and if that keeps in mind body composition. Are there not studies that show body composition can be improved by ketosis? And that ketosis triggers muscle sparing that contributes to body composition during weight loss? </p>
<p> Would love to hear what you/the-body-of-science think! </p>
<p> OK, so perhaps the biggest “problem” with research on IF is that it often doesn’t control for caloric intake – and people aren’t taking this into account when looking at research. </p>
<p> Think about this – We know that caloric restriction (and the associated weight loss): – results in improvements in insulin sensitivity (in overweight people) – results in improvements in testosterone levels (in overweight people) – results in increased sirtuin production and longevity </p>
<p> So if a group of subjects are doing IF while also eating a hypocaloric diet, then can we attribute the beneficial outcomes to IF, when we know for a fact that caloric restriction also has the same beneficial effects? 🙂 In my opinion, no. </p>
<p> You can check out this narrative review on the topic, for example, (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5371748/), which looked exclusively at studies that matched caloric intake between groups (TRF and CER) and which concluded that the available research hasn’t yet shown any definitive benefits of IF with regards to weight loss, insulin sensitivity, RMR, etc. </p>
<p> You’ll notice that the review above also looks at lean body mass retention, and essentially concludes that IF doesn’t seem to have any LBM sparing benefits when calories, protein and physical activity are controlled. </p>
<p> Regarding HGH, I think most people are misunderstanding what exactly is happening and why. In simple terms, HGH increases during fasting simply as a normal physiological response to help substrate mobilization. It’s the same as, say, insulin increasing when we eat in order to increase the uptake of glycogen and amino acids in muscles, increase the synthesis and absorption of lipids in fat tissue, etc. There’s nothing “good” or “bad” about these. They are just normal physiological responses that happen for a reason and, outside the context of the overall surpluses and deficits that happen all the time, don’t really mean much. </p>
<p> Regarding ketosis, again, when calories and protein are controlled for, there’s little reason to believe that it should result in improved body composition relative to a higher carb diet. To learn more about this, I would urge you to read the “Carbohydrates” part of this paper: https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-20. </p>
<p> Would be interested in hearing your thoughts! </p>
<p> P.S. I’ve written an article for another big fitness website discussing much of what you’re asking here, which should be published sometime this month! We’ll share it through our social media accounts when it does, so keep an eye out for it! 🙂 </p>
<p> Thank you for such a quick and thorough response, I’ve learned a lot ! Looking forward to your next article. </p>
<p> The important thing about a ketogenic diet is not that it somehow magically increases metabolism, (it obviously doesn’t,) but rather that it puts your metabolism in a different “mode” (burning fat when you run out of sugar and deplete glycogen stores.) </p>
<p> Yes, a calorie is a calorie. BUT, prolonged low blood sugar states (induced by reducing carb intake via keto diet) COMBINED with intermittent fasting will burn more fat than intermittent fasting combined with a typical diet including carbs. In the latter, during which the metabolism will be in it’s default glucose-burning mode, much of the “fasting” period will be spent burning through glycogen stores in the muscles. Only after the glycogen stores are depleted and the subject maintains fasting will actual fat loss occur. The studies provided only looked at energy expenditure, which misses this very important point entirely. </p>
<p> Again, this is not a disagreement. A calorie deficit is the only way to burn fat. It’s just that a ketogenic diet will set your metabolism from it’s default glucose-using state to the fat-using state (ketosis) BEFORE fasting begins, so that when it’s time to fast you spend more hours physically burning fat than having to burn through sugar first. </p>
<p> It’s true that ketogenic diets will cause the body to burn more fat. What you’re not considering, however, is that most of the extra fat burned is dietary fat and not body fat, since ketogenic diets are inherently high in fat. </p>
<p> This is, of course, why metabolic ward research comparing ketogenic to non-ketogenic diets with matched calories and protein has consistently failed to detect any differences in fat loss between groups. </p>
<p> I have been doing Keto with IF and only things thats worked. For me. Tried lots fad diets, SW & WW. Loads gym etc. As soon as I stopped the carbs, sugars, ate fat ( which always a ovoided). Am 52 , gained subborn body fat, and was about to accept it was my age, hormones, etc… Had a stone and half to get off, which as I say was about to give up and accept my extra midriff What I will say YES I do have to eat around a set defacit, which is only way eating as a fat burner that my body will once its has used the dietry fat, has burnt off body fat!! It did do that, it fell,off. Woo hoo. I worked out my natural BMR. Deducted 500 cals. So once my body burns the dietry fat to that amount of fuel, of course it will go,burn the body fat for its remaining energy it needs to meet my BMR needs. Thats what I do. I also IF 16:8 every day, and it has maintained for first time ever!! Im keen to keep insulin levels ticking very low ( have type 2 diebetes in family) and I do think I could poss had been early insulin resistance, as carbs and sugars made me feel ruff. So basically keto, ‘fat burner’ does burn body fat, providing you stick to it, eat little carbs/sugar and moderate protein, count macros accoridng to calorie intake BMR with reduction of 15-20% so you are in defacit. Only those who,consume too much fat, and do,not moderate their macros, as yes fat is very high in cals, it wont burn anything other than dietry fat. Physically I feel,better, sleep,better, more energetic, aches and pains in joints eased, slimmer, skin better, and no,hunger pangs all time. I find IF easier on Keto, and even eat 2 meals nutrient dense a day only now. Our bodies in my olinion from my experience react mich better to natural,healthy fats, I eat plenty of low carb veg & salad. Mineral and vit suplliments to help. Keto & IF very powerful together for weight loss in controlled macro to calories needed for sure!! As for studies etc, I am going from personal experience and my own research. A dieter all my life, always gained weight so easy, yo yo dieting, for once at last found something that actually works and keeps it off. I know people whos diebetes and other health issues have gone, from ditching carbs and sugars, and eating fats. Amazing!! </p>
<p> It’s great that an approach combining IF and keto has helped you control your energy intake and make healthier food choices! Keep it up! 🙂 </p>

<p> Myolean Fitness: “Yes, a Keto diet burns more fat, but it’s dietary fat that you’re eating a lot of, not body fat, which is the fat that makes you look fat.” </p>
<p> Sam: “I’m on Keto and IF and I’m losing body fat like crazy.” </p>
<p> Myolean Fitness: “Oh.” </p>
<p> Perhaps that “Oh” should be changed to “D’oh!” </p>
<p> Myolean Fitness 30/01/2018 at 9:49 pm </p>
<p> It truly is shocking how a ketogenic diet combined with IF can help you eat less and, consequently, lose fat! </p>
<p> It personally helped me deal with Myocarditis, and regulated my diet and Cravings. I never felt better. So there is a massive change in my life overall, not related to weight or fat lose as i never had this problem. </p>
<p> Seems to me like you are gathering all the article that supports your claims, and there milions of more articles that says different. Ive been following dr. Eric Berg, and what you are claiming completely contradicts what he has been saying for years. </p>
<p> So call me a bit naive, as i am a part of the general polulation, isnt it better to try things and decide for yourself what is benefitial and what is not? I only ask this as ifind your article very discouraging towards IF. </p>
<p> There is a benefit in regards to insulin and sugar level stabilisation – i am a living example, and i am not an animal either. </p>
<p> You wrote: “Based on what you say, there is no benefit in IF.” </p>
<p> Well, not exactly. What the article says is, and I quote: “In short, what we currently know from human research is that there MAY be health and longevity benefits to fasting without caloric restriction, but that there is, currently, no strong evidence to support this.” </p>
<p> There’s a difference between saying that there is no benefit in IF and saying that there MAY be a benefit without caloric restriction, but there’s currently no strong evidence to support this. </p>
<p> You wrote: “Seems to me like you are gathering all the article that supports your claims…” </p>
<p> I can assure you that Myolean Fitness has no biases and we only care about the truth. I can also assure you that we would be extremely happy if new research shows that IF has, without a doubt, health benefits! If you think that there is strong research showing that IF has health benefits in humans in the absence of caloric restriction, please do share it with us 🙂 </p>
<p> You wrote: “Ive been following dr. Eric Berg, and what you are claiming completely contradicts what he has been saying for years.” </p>
<p> In my opinion, Eric is not a good source of nutrition information – chiropractors generally get pretty much no nutrition education. Also, a quick Google search suggests that Eric is not a very trustworthy practitioner (https://www.casewatch.org/board/chiro/berg.shtml). </p>
<p> Regarding trying things for yourself, we absolutely recommend that you do! </p>
<p> Also, we are definitely not against IF and, in fact, we have several of our clients on numerous IF protocols. We just prefer to remain objective and unbiased, not letting our feelings regarding any dietary and training approach cloud our scientific opinion of them. </p>
<p> Regarding insulin and sugar level stabilization, the research is mixed. Here’s a quote from an article I wrote for another website: </p>
<p> “One study by Ash et al, for example, reported similar improvements in glycaemic control in 51 men with type 2 diabetes after 12 weeks of intermittent (four days per week) or continuous energy restriction (6). </p>
<p> A 2011 study by Harvie et al which measured hepatic insulin sensitivity in overweight or obese subjects reported a 25% greater reduction in insulin resistance compared to the daily energy restriction group when measured on the morning after five normal feeding days. </p>
<p> It also reported a further 25% reduction in insulin resistance compared with daily energy restriction on the morning after the two energy-restricted days. Importantly, these differences in insulin sensitivity happened despite similar reductions in body fat between the groups (4). </p>
<p> Three other studies that have assessed the effects of 2–3 weeks of whole day fasting and which were designed to ensure that there was no overall energy deficit or weight loss have also reported variable results. </p>
<p> Specifically, the first study by Halberg et al reported improvements in insulin-mediated whole-body glucose uptake and insulin-induced inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis when measured after two normal feeding days (29), while these results could not be replicated by the Soeters et al study (22). </p>
<p> Interestingly, the third study by Heilbronn et al reported a significant reduction in insulin response and improved glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in male subjects, whilst female subjects experienced impaired glucose uptake and apparent skeletal muscle insulin resistance (30). </p>
<p> Overall, the limited available research has reported variable effects of intermittent fasting on peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity, which may be gender-specific.” </p>
<p> There’s millions of us Muslims who fast every year. I notice NO health benefit from fasting compared to when I normally eat. I know many other people who fast for religious reasons too. There’s nothing magical about fasting. And I don’t feel better when I fast. I rather not fast but I do it for religious reasons. </p>
<p> Just because it works great for you doesn’t mean it works great for everyone. The best diet will always be the one a person can stick to and enjoy. And IF can make some people binge eat. Not everyone has the same experience. </p>
<p> So your experience does not apply to all people. I notice nothing special about fasting personally. </p>
<p> Does intermittent fasting help to lower ones overall blood pressure ? Mine is about 130 and I would like to decrease it to 110 </p>
<p> When controlling for confounding variables, intermittent fasting on its own doesn’t seem to affect blood pressure (although there’s currently not much research on this). </p>
<p> In general, what seems to reliably help reduce blood pressure is weight loss, exercise, stress management, and a good balance of dietary sodium and potassium (usually, for most people, the former needs to decrease and the latter needs to increase). </p>
<p> I am insulin resistant which messed up my hormones and caused pcos.keto and IF helped me a lot with pcos symptoms. I feel better when I fast. </p>
<p> Makes sense. IF is just a TOOL for fat loss. IF in and of itself does not help you lose weight. It’s the calorie deficit that does. I suppose you can argue that you could IF and still reap the benefits of fasting (numerous ones that you mentioned) and still not lose weight if you’re eating too much during the eating window. </p>
<p> For example, you could eat at a surplus at the end of the day, yet still have upregulation in growth hormone, increase insulin sensitivity, and feel more prductive throughout the day. No reason to not try it out. Although I think in general, people who DO try IF for the first time generally lose weight but they find it harder to consume that many calories in such a short amount of time. </p>
<p> What’s your take on spirulina? I IF every day, but intake about 5g of spirulina in the morning. And then just sip on coffee/preworkout for 8 hours till I’m ready to eat. I’m pretty sure its not kicking my insulin response into overdrive but would love your take on it. Cheers. Thanks! </p>
<p> Agreed – at this point, it’s pretty much conclusive that intermittent energy restriction helps people lose more fat by making sustaining an energy deficit easier! </p>
<p> With regards to taking spirulina in the morning and then sipping on coffee until you are ready to break your fast, that sounds just fine to me! </p>
<p> I’m so impressed with your research and how well you make this complicated issue understandable to the lay person. I’m also very amazed at your dedication to responding with helpful follow-up! </p>
<p> I am a 71 year old very lean woman who has struggled with hypoglycemia. While I was not at all overweight, I found that an additional 5 pounds made my clothes too tight for comfort. So I tried the IF 16:8 for about 3 weeks, hoping the IF protocol would be a good long-term plan to help cognition and longevity as well as the other touted benefits. I struggled with feeling weak, but I usually made it for 16 hours. Amazingly I lost 8 pounds, which makes me now underweight. Being hypoglycemic, I have always eating a ketogenic diet even before it became popular. Your balanced coverage comparing various models of calorie restriction and IF is causing me to rethink how strict I felt I must be. So in spite of the fact that I still have 2 hours to go in my 16 hour fast, I’m going to celebrate and have a handful of nuts! Thank you! </p>
<p> I think this is CLICK BAIT but however. I agree with, the statement, That “everyone can eat whatever as long as there is a calorie deficit”. Unfortunately, a lot of the population are unable to eat high carb diets and control the calorie deficit. The difference in eating certain proportions of the 3 main macros(glucose, protein and fat) is the ability to stave off the hunger that accompanies a calorie deficit. It seems that IF is one of these ways for some, carb restriction for others, and even, high protein for still others, if it was one size fits all there wouldn’t be an obesity problem. Most states in the USA have an obesity problem of up to 35%, that is not counting those with a 25-30 BMI. So cut these people a bit of slack, and have some empathy for their inability to eat 1500 calories of twinkies every day until the are down to their correct weight. </p>
<p> I agree with what you’re saying, and I’m not sure why you feel that we are saying something different… Can you please paste the exact sentence/phrase where you think that we are suggesting that it’s a good idea to eat 1500 calories of Twinkies every day? </p>
<p> Hi! What is your opinion on Dr Fung’s works? He claims that a calorie is not a calorie. </p>
<p> The whole “ calories in calories out” mindset is missing the Insulin sensitivity issue altogether. It is insulin sensitivity that is the major factor for Body fat increase. What you eat, “where the calories come from” is the most important factor of the whole equation. While calorie restriction is relevant it is secondary to blood insulin levels and hormone sensitive lipase. I wouldn’t suggest fasting if you’re a sugar eater. Every couple of hours you will want to kick a baby in the face. There is usually plenty of research on both sides of any topic to prove their point. That’s how research works. If you were looking at intermittent fasting as a way to improve fat loss realize it’s not the intermittent fasting but the decreased insulin level in the blood that allows for hormone sensitive lipase to do it’s job Which is mobilize fat for fuel Stumbled onto this article while looking at amino acids to minimize lean muscle loss during multiple day fasting. If you’re fat quit sugar and carbs first. Then re-strict calorie intake. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there is a large body of scientific evidence which suggests that insulin sensitivity is pretty irrelevant for fat loss and that the primary criterion is, instead, a sustained hypocaloric diet. </p>
<p> For example, here is one study (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2673150) that aimed to determine the effect of a healthy low-fat (HLF) diet vs a healthy low-carbohydrate (HLC) diet on weight change and if genotype pattern or insulin secretion are related to the dietary effects on weight loss. Here are the conclusions: “In this 12-month weight loss diet study, there was no significant difference in weight change between a healthy low-fat diet vs a healthy low-carbohydrate diet, and neither genotype pattern nor baseline insulin secretion was associated with the dietary effects on weight loss. In the context of these 2 common weight loss diet approaches, neither of the 2 hypothesized predisposing factors was helpful in identifying which diet was better for whom.” </p>
<p> Here is another recent study (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049516300725), which concluded that “These findings suggest that weight loss itself, rather than diet composition, may be the most critical factor for reducing the chronic inflammation that has been suggested to be a key factor in promoting insulin resistance.” </p>
<p> Thanks again for your comment, and please feel free to reference research to support your position. </p>
<p> Hello and thanks for the useful information. currently i am doing intermittent Fasting by not eating from 6pm to 12pm. Which skips breakfast. I read that skipping breakfast can have a higher rate or heart issues? Are there studies that backs this claim? Is it better to skip dinner instead? </p>
<p> There is some research which has found an association between skipping breakfast and heart disease. Remember, however, that association does not imply causation. Simply put, it’s probably not that skipping breakfast causes heart disease but, instead, that people who tend to skip breakfast also tend to engage in other behaviors that can increase the risk of heart disease, such as consuming more junk food, not being physically active, and smoking. </p>
<p> I am on Keto but I have a friend that follows IF listening to doctor fung. Very good listen on why caloric deficits are a short term answer but end up slowing base metabolism more. </p>
<p> 1. What is the research behind the microbiome’s effects on diets/dieting? I have read that artificial sweeteners have a detrimental effect on your gut microbiome composition and metabolic capacity (nature and science primary articles). Also I have read pop-sci summaries of articles that claim that there likely is a benefit to matching diet to certain people, but this affect get’s lost when taking the average of a study, rather than looking at unique groupings of patient populations, and it may be due to the gut microbiome. </p>
<p> 2. What is your understanding on how calories are actually measured in today’s day and age? Is it still bomb calorimetry? If so, are there good metrics to reports utilize-able calories? </p>
<p> A few thoughts to tie these ideas together. I think the types of foods do matter, only such that “whole foods” and good/bad carbs or fats or proteins are just a stand in for how accessible the caloric content it. For example white bread and sprouted grain bread might have the same caloric content as measured by the bomb calorimetry, but accessible calories are drastically different (I know the blood glucose index tries to take account for this, but isn’t systematic for all foods and may complicate the true measure of caloric deficits). So you will get more of a deficit from the sprouted grain. Along these same lines, I think the composition of your gut bacteria also affect how efficiently you process different versions of the same type of foods. Some foods might be “less utilized” by one person than another based on the total metabolic capability of their gut microbioime. Furthermore, there is increased evidence that these bugs alter your cravings etc. There has been incidences of people that get fecal transplants from an obese donor become obese themselves. Again, like your articles states very well, these things likely all come down to the complex questions of actually measuring true calories in vs. calories out. The big thing to me dovetails with your analysis: its all about adherence to a plan of restricted calories- and I imagine some the biggest drivers of breaking diets are cravings related, either from gut microbiome signals, artificial sweeteners messing with cravings, or highly processed foods causing big energy crashes that lead to higher consumptions of food. </p>
<p> One final random point is that my hypothesis for better longevity on fasting is likely repair based. Every time your metabolism is revved up, you are using oxygen and producing free radicals. If you are constantly eating, or never reaching a fasting state, your cells (specifically pancreatic beta cells, etc) never get time to deal with the natural damage that is inevitable from all oxygen utilizing organisms. </p>
<p> As a scientist, I appreciate how you have presented this article- and understand the resistance to it- stemming from people wanting a silver-bullet fix to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. </p>
<p> 1. The research on the links between the gut microbiome and obesity is at its infancy and there’s not much we can conclude from it at this point, in my opinion. However, we can safely say that there’s a link between the two. I’m not sure if we can, at this point, say if its an unhealthy gut microbiome that causes obesity or if it’s the other way round. Maybe it’s even both! </p>
<p> With regards to individual differences in the make-up of the gut microbiome and obesity, that’s an ever more specialized topic which definitely needs more research. </p>
<p> In general, my recommendations at this point are pretty simple: try to maintain a “healthy” gut flora by eating foods rich in probiotics and prebiotics, while also avoiding doing things that can kill good bacteria (excessive antibiotic use, excessive drinking, smoking, stress, etc). </p>
<p> Regarding the rest of your comment on how metabolizable energy and individual difference in gut flora are concerned, I agree! 🙂 </p>
<p> Regarding fasting and longevity, I also agree. In general, autophagy seems to be the result of low energy availability at a cellular level. The question now is whether intermittent energy restriction has any beneficial effects beyond those that daily energy restriction has. </p>
<p> Again, thanks for your insightful comment. It’s always a pleasure getting comments like yours! 🙂 </p>
<p> Can somebody clarify for me. So if I’m intermittent fasting for weigh loss benefits – BCCA drinks will not break my fast? </p>
<p> “Despite what most people think (and what the nutritional info label on your BCAA product says) ALL BCAA products contain calories. Leucine and isoleucine contain 4.65 calories per gram, while valine contains 4.64 calories per gram. With the typical 2:1:1 ratio of most BCAA products, this means that 10g of BCAAs contain around 46.5 calories. </p>
<p> So yes, BCAAs break your fast. However, it doesn’t really matter if they do or don’t in the first place.” </p>
<p> I’ve just started looking into IF. My main question is about what you can eat. I did read the article and a few comments and responses. I’m wondering, I have a 6 meal a day meal plan made just for me counting macros. Am I to take that meal plan and fit all 6 meals into 2 meals in the given time frame I choose for IF? </p>
<p> You can take the 6 meals and fit them into however many meals you want within your feeding window. For most people most of the time, 1-3 meals would make sense, depending on the length of the feeding window. </p>
<p> Out of curiosity: 1. What’s your weight, height, and activity level? 2. What’s your current fitness goal (weight loss/maintenance/gain) 3. What are your target calories and macros? </p>
<p> This was just what I needed to read when I’m on my third day of IF (16:8 protocol) main goal being weight and fat loss. I need to be doing this for the right reasons, which is weight loss achieved by caloric restriction through IF, not the claimed increase in HGH and whatever. </p>
<p> questions: – what’s your opinion on the magical drink apple cider vinegar and claim that it enhances fat burning? – training during a fast period vs. during an eating window and does this affect fat burning? I suppose if you can manage training (weight or cardio) during a fasting period, it’s probably ok for you and your muscle gain? </p>
<p> Apple Cider Vinegar may slow down gastric emptying and cause a bit of nausea, which means that it can help reduce hunger/make you feel full a bit sooner when eating. Essentially, it may help you eat a little less, thereby creating a caloric deficit. However, it may have negative effects on tooth enamel and on the esophagus and stomach. I would recommend you just put a little vinegar (any vinegar) on your veggies or salad! 🙂 </p>
<p> Training fasted increases fat oxidation during training, but your body compensates later in the day by burning less fat and more carbs. This is probably why research has found no beneficial effects of fasted training on body composition: https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-014-0054-7 </p>
<p> You say that the calorie deficit is what results in weight loss and not necessarily IT, but Dr Fongs research (or referenced research) show that reduced calorie intake causes metabolism to slow and becomes a vicious cycle to keep up with. You reference the old “calories in less than calories out = weight loss” when Dr Fong debunks that in his book. Whos right? </p>
<p> Dr. Fung isn’t a researcher and has not published any research that I could find. </p>
<p> Regarding the research he references to show that reduced calorie intakes cause metabolic rate to slow down, we actually agree that this is the case. Reducing calorie intake always results in small reductions in metabolic rate. However, these reductions are closer to around 10% and not 40% as Dr. Fung suggests. Dr. Fung is getting these larger numbers because he is using people’s initial weight to calculate metabolic rate, while the honest thing to do is to use people’s new weight. </p>
<p> Regarding the becoming a vicious cycle part, I wouldn’t say that this is accurate. The reason people seem to regain lost weight is because they revert back to their old ways of eating too much junk and not exercising. However, you can’t expect that, once you lose weight, you can revert to your bad dietary habits and keep it off. Successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance is about establishing good habits for the rest of your life, like eating healthy, exercising, monitoring your weight, and having support from your environment. </p>
<p> With regards to the “old” calories in, calories out model, this has never been debunked in any study in the history of ever. I think the problem with CICO is that most people make incorrect assumptions about what it is and what it entails. I would encourage you to read this article on it: https://www.myoleanfitness.com/cico-evidence-based-truth/ </p>
<p> Maybe Dr. Fung claims to have debunked CICO in his book. However, he claims so in a “safe space” where other scientists can’t criticize his theories. In fact, at least 99% of the scientific community thinks very little of him, largely due to the fact that he seems to dismiss the energy balance equation which is essentially a rehash of the first law of thermodynamics. </p>
<p> I know that it can be confusing to see all the back-and-forth discussions between obesity experts on the internet and I understand that people are finding it hard to choose who to believe. If it’s any consolation, we are always open to discussion, so you can email us at any time to exchange ideas. 🙂 </p>
<p> Thanks for the great article & discussion. I know that there should be a caloric dificit to lose weight on IF, however, i read that if you fast for longer than 12 hours, your body will start using the stored fat for energy, do you agree on that? the reason why i am trying IF now is to eat all my calories in one meal & reduce my carbs in that meal to 25% so that the body will burn this 25% during my fasting and will start burning the fat until i eat. So basically you can say that i am trying to lose fat not weight, or losing fat & maintaining muscles. Do you agree on my approach or you think that i am just wasting my time? </p>
<p> P. S. I am fast for the whole day then i workout fasted at around 7:00 PM then i have my one meal at around 10:00 pm. </p>
<p> Another question, do pre-workouts, multivitamins, fat burners, fish oil, contain calories that will cause the body to produce insulin? </p>
<p> Okay, so the body doesn’t necessarily only burn fat when you fast longer than 12 hours. The body will burn fat even if you’re eating every 2 hours, provided that it’s receiving less energy than it’s expending, overall. This is reflected in the results of several studies which show that Intermittent Fasting without a caloric deficit (i.e. subjects overeat enough during feeding hours to compensate for the energy deficit) doesn’t result in fat loss. Similarly, research that has subjects eating up to 8 small meals per day reports significant fat loss, provided that a caloric deficit is in place. </p>
<p> Regarding losing fat while maintaining muscle (this will result in weight loss, by the way, since fat has weight), research suggests that this should be done by: 1. Going on a small-moderate, rather than large, deficit, 2. Getting enough protein (around 2 grams per kg of body weight), 3. Performing resistance training with sufficient intensity and volume. </p>
<p> As you can see, the above don’t include recommendations for meal frequency, which means that fat loss and muscle retention can be achieved with, or without, intermittent fasting. This has also been our experience with several of our clients (we have coached people doing a number of IF protocols and successfully got the super lean without muscle loss). </p>
<p> Regarding the supplements you’ve mentioned: 1. Pre workouts: most of these contain calories. Then again, most of them are also a waste of money, since they contain lots of fillers and some good, but underdosed ingredients. 2. Multivitamins: most multivitamin products don’t contain calories. However, the fat-soluble vitamins won’t be absorbed if you take them when fasting. 3. Fat burners: most fat burners don’t contain calories. However, most fat burners are a waste of money. 4.

<p> Please note that insulin is also pretty irrelevant. We explain why in the article above! 🙂 </p>
<p> I just popped in here to thank you for having such a scientific approach to this topic, I’m loving the way you’re dealing with the questions and sometimes their less than positive approaches to questioning things. Also, the amount of long answers with such an amount of information is incredible, Keep up the good work!! </p>
<p> Thank you for the article and for replying to all of the comments. I’ve learned a lot from just that. Do you have any recent articles or anything in the works? Lastly I’ve read a lot of articles suggesting to eating carbs around workouts is the best when on low carb type diets. After reading ur article I would assume that the only apparent benefit would be to increase performance and that nutrient “carb” timing doesnt matter as long as ur in a hypocaloric state when ur main goal is fatloss/muscle retention. So does eating carbs around workout have benefits outside of performance enhancement? Thanks in advance. </p>
<p> Thanks – I’m glad to know that the article and comment replies help! 🙂 </p>
<p> Regarding your questions: </p>
<p> 1. We don’t have anything in the works at the moment. 2. Eating carbs around workouts may help by improving performance and facilitating recovery. As far as I know, there aren’t any other potential benefits. </p>
<p> I just had to add my two cents worth. I speak as a 76 year old guy. When I was young – long, long ago in the Before Times – caloric consumption was tremendously lower than today. We had coffee – not lattes, cappuccinos or other thousand calorie sugar drinks with high octane coffee.. </p>
<p> Supermarkets were filled with FOOD – real food. Look around a supermarket today and you will see that 75% of the store is filled with sugar-laden empty calories. Also called junk foods. </p>
<p> Ice cream was a treat – not a daily part of the diet. So was soda. Desserts were desserts not something to be consumed at every meal or INSTEAD OF MEALS. </p>
<p> I guess the message would be – eat as if you are poor. Eat only what you need. Eat for nutrition. Don’t eat for comfort because that turns into grazing which just adds hundreds, if not thousands, of extra, unused calories into your body each day. </p>
<p> Oh, and we moved around more. Office workers had to get up from their desks and actually WALK up or down stairs or to the other end of the building to transact business. We didn’t send emails and sit and wait for a response. </p>
<p> Accidentally ‘bucked up’ your Site; and I just couldN’T Stop READING ALL Posted here!!! This ‘forum’ is EXCELLENT!! And, YU, how yu Patiently ExPlain YOUR side of it all, the Science in it all; just Fascinating.. </p>
<p> I do still believe however though, that there’s ‘something’ to that ‘Insulin’ thing (that a few of the folks here have so stated); and I do believe that other Hormone ‘Cortisol’, does have something to do with our Gut being Fat.. </p>
<p> I know from all yu’ve explained here, it’s basically Calorie in LESS, than what Expelled out (to achieve that weight loss); but I just don’t know is that’s really ALL it is (shaking my head); as how would one then explain, why the Gut is so hard to loose/can’t loose; nuh matter how do Tummy exercise (the tiny pouch still there (that Fat is still there))?? </p>
<p> Thank you for your comment and for your kind words 🙂 </p>
<p> Okay, so what seems to cause “stubborn” fat in some areas of the body (typically belly, love handles, butt, and thighs) is the: 1. High density of alpha-2 adregenic receptors 2. Lower blood flow to those areas </p>
<p> Together, the above make the body fat in those areas of the body more “stubborn”, which is why it’s the last to go (and why it’s so hard to get rid of). </p>
<p> P.S.: A negative energy balance is the primary determinant of changes in body mass, but calories are NOT the only thing that matters! Other things matter too if you care about optimizing health and body composition (e.g., food quality, food processing degree, macronutrient ratios, etc.) </p>

<p> Is it Safe to Eat Food after Ants Have Gotten to It? </p>
<p> You may wonder if it is safe to eat food after ants have gotten into it. For the most part, you won’t have any issues. </p>
<p> Of course, you want to make sure all of the ants are removed, but there are places in the world where people intentionally consume them! They are considered a source of protein. In other locations, chocolate covered ants are considered a delicacy! </p>
<p> It may gross you out, the thought of eating anything ants have gotten into. They aren’t dirty like some other types of pests. Typically, eating something they get into won’t make you sick either. </p>
<p> The thought of it though can gross some people out! For others, it is a thrilling new experience. For those that don’t have money to replace items, they may have no choice but to consume them. </p>
<p> Try to remove any remaining ants from the food source and eliminate any dead ones. Ants tend to get into food items that are sweet. </p>
<p> If you decide to use them, make sure you find a better way to seal them up. This will prevent ants from getting into them in the future. </p>
<p> Will it Matter Which Species of Ants? </p>
<p> Typically, the species of ants which will find their way into food sources are called sugar ants. They are harmless but they are attracted to just about anything sweet. </p>
<p> This includes sugar and foods that contain sugar in them. They have a very good sense of smell and they will be able to get into a home through very tiny cracks around windows or the structure. </p>
<p> Sugar ants aren’t going to bite you or sting you. If you happen to consume them when they have been in your food, they won’t be causing any problems in your mouth or in the digestive system. </p>
<p> However, less than 1% of the population is allergic to sugar ants and that could trigger a variety of harsh side effects. </p>
<p> Should you consume fire ants or those which are able to bite; the outcome can be very different. Some ants are able to sting, and the venom they deliver is powerful even though the ants are so small. </p>
<p> If they bite the inside of the mouth it can be very painful and the area may swell up. The area may be sensitive for several days afterward.. </p>
<p> Should you swallow these types of ants while they are still alive, they may not have time to sting you or bite you on the way down. </p>
<p> You aren’t out of the woods though, as they can create some travel within your esophagus and throughout the digestive system. Your body may not respond well to these tiny foreign elements. </p>
<p> When it comes to basic sugar ants, they aren’t going to be difficult to swallow or cause any harm. They aren’t going to be able to live in your stomach or crawl around your body! </p>
<p> The acid in your stomach is going to be more than enough to kill them right away! This may help put your mind at ease if you do eat some ants at some point! </p>
<p> Do Ants Carry Diseases? </p>
<p> You don’t have to worry about diseases from ants. They don’t carry any toxins. While it is best to not eat food with ants still in it, you are fine to do so if you desire. </p>
<p> If they have all left that area, you don’t necessarily have to toss the item out. Depending on the type of food source, you may be able to wash it. If so, it is recommended to do so before you eat it. </p>
<p> There are some that believe ants can cause you to get sick though. They believe they can carry germs and they can spread salmonella. However, those germs were already in the home and they were going to be there regardless of the ants. </p>
<p> While the ants get the blame, the underlying culprit is humans. Either the area wasn’t kept clean or they left out food that should have been refrigerated. </p>
<p> There may be bacteria on some food items, and that is going to make you sick if you consume it. The food may be rotten or been exposed to room temperature for too long. </p>
<p> The ants may be attracted to it, and if you eat it, you can suffer the consequences, but that isn’t due to anything the ants contributed. They tend to get the blame but that isn’t the underlying cause of it at all. </p>
<p> Instead, it has to do with pathogens found on the food item – regardless of the ants touching it. They didn’t bring those pathogens or cause them to develop. </p>
<p> Will eating ants make you Sick? </p>
<p> You may be worried eating food ants have gotten into will make you sick. Some households toss out the food because of this worry, they don’t want to take the risk. </p>
<p> They worry the ants may have gotten into poison to kill them off and that could now be on the food source. Ants would be taking any such poison back to their nest to store it as food. They wouldn’t be in your home getting into your food. They are in the food you have available to take it to their nest. </p>
<p> Numerous studies conducted on ants show they are very clean and sterile creatures. This can give you peace of mind about eating food they have had access to. Ants have antimicrobial agents in their bodies too. </p>
<p> These agents actually stop the development and growth of germs. If you happen to consume some ants intentionally or by accident, there is typically not going to be any harm done. </p>
<p> Some people get sick when they find out they consumed ants, because of the mental concept it creates for them. It can cause them to feel nauseated or vomit. This isn’t due to how their body reacts to ants though. </p>
<p> Instead, it is a psychological reaction that in turn influences the body to reject that situation. Some people can’t get beyond the fact they consumed ants and they are disgusted by it so their brain is working hard to find a solution. </p>
<p> Where do People Consume Ants? </p>
<p> There are various locations where people in given cultures consume ants regularly. One of them is the Aboriginal tribes located in Australia. They consume honey pot ants because they eat a variety of insects and bugs. </p>
<p> This is inside of them and offers the tribe people a great source of food and nutrients. </p>
<p> In other locations, wild red ants are collected for the purpose of consuming them. This includes tribes found in Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. They are widely consumed throughout Brazil and Columbia. In the USA, there are sold to thrill-seekers interested in trying this out firsthand. </p>
<p> Ants can be eating raw or they can be cooked. It all depends on the taste someone wants and the culture. The taste depends on the species of ants too. They tend to be sour on their own. </p>
<p> They can be coated with chocolate or honey for a sweet taste. They can be baked or roasted if you prefer. </p>
<p> Examine the Food </p>
<p> When ants have gotten into food, examine it, and decide if you still want to eat it or dispose of it. If the ant activity seems very minimal, that can encourage you to keep the product. </p>
<p> If the source is a large purchase, such as a 25-pound bag of sugar, you may be more inclined to keep it so you aren’t wasting money to replace it. </p>
<p> As a rule of thumb, any food that has been left out when it should have been refrigerated should be tossed out. This is due to health concerns with it more than the issue of the ants though. </p>
<p> You don’t want to end up with food poisoning or other problems because you choose to eat that food. </p>
<p> It may surprise you to learn ants will also be attracted to greasy foods. Clean up after your meals right away. The longer you leave food out, the higher the risk you will attract ants with it. </p>
<p> Pack any leftovers in airtight containers so the ants can’t get into them. If you procrastinate you may discover the ants have already found their way to that food source and helped themselves. </p>
<p> The Final Decision is yours </p>
<p> Statistically, there aren’t any reports of anyone becoming seriously ill or dying because they ate food after ants have gotten into it. If there is an infestation, you are better off tossing the food items out and replacing them. </p>
<p> If there aren’t a large number of them the final decision is yours. Some individuals have a harder time getting beyond the mental aspect of doing so than others. </p>
<p> To keep ants from getting into your food, make sure you wipe down counters regularly. Take care of spills immediately too, especially sugary drinks or foods. Make sure you keep products in tight containers. </p>
<p> Add some cinnamon sticks to your sugar canister and it will keep the ants at bay! </p>

<p> Is It Really OK To Eat Food That’s Fallen On The Floor? </p>
<p> It’s not still good. Sharon Sperry Bloom/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND </p>
<p> When you drop a piece of food on the floor, is it really OK to eat if you pick up within five seconds? This urban food myth contends that if food spends just a few seconds on the floor, dirt and germs won’t have much of a chance to contaminate it. Research in my lab has focused on how food and food contact surfaces become contaminated, and we’ve done some work on this particular piece of wisdom. </p>
<p> While the “five-second rule” might not seem like the most pressing issue for food scientists to get to the bottom of, it’s still worth investigating food myths like this one because they shape our beliefs about when food is safe to eat. </p>
<p> So is five seconds on the floor the critical threshold that separates an edible morsel from a case of food poisoning? It’s a bit a more complicated than that. It depends on just how much bacteria can make it from floor to food in a few seconds and just how dirty the floor is. </p>
<p> Where Did The Five-Second Rule Come From? </p>
<p> Wondering if food is still OK to eat after it’s been dropped on the floor (or anywhere else) is a pretty common experience. And it’s probably not a new one either. </p>
<p> A well-known, but inaccurate, story about Julia Child may have contributed to this food myth. Some viewers of her cooking show, The French Chef, insist they saw Child drop lamb (or a chicken or a turkey, depending on the version of the tale) on the floor and pick it up, with the advice that if they were alone in the kitchen, their guests would never know. </p>
<p> In fact it was a potato pancake, and it fell on the stovetop, not on the floor. Child put it back in the pan, saying “But you can always pick it up and if you are alone in the kitchen, who is going to see?” But the misremembered story persists. </p>
<p> It’s harder to pin down the origins of the oft-quoted five-second rule, but a 2003 study reported that 70% of women and 56% of men surveyed were familiar with the five-second rule and that women were more likely than men to eat food that had been dropped on the floor. </p>
<p> So what does science tell us about what a few moments on the floor means for the safety of your food? </p>
<p> Five Seconds Is All It Takes </p>
<p> The earliest research report on the five-second rule is attributed to Jillian Clarke, a high school student participating in a research apprenticeship at the University of Illinois. Clarke and her colleagues inoculated floor tiles with bacteria then placed food on the tiles for varying times. </p>
<p> They reported bacteria were transferred from the tile to gummy bears and cookies within five seconds, but didn’t report the specific amount of bacteria that made it from the tile to the food. </p>
<p> But How Much Bacteria Actually Transfer In Five Seconds? </p>
<p> In 2007, my lab at Clemson University published a study – the only peer-reviewed journal paper on this topic – in the Journal of Applied Microbiology. We wanted to know if the length of time food is in contact with a contaminated surface affected the rate of transfer of bacteria to the food. </p>
<p> To find out, we inoculated squares of tile, carpet or wood with Salmonella. Five minutes after that, we placed either bologna or bread on the surface for five, 30 or 60 seconds, and then measured the amount of bacteria transferred to the food. We repeated this exact protocol after the bacteria had been on the surface for two, four, eight and 24 hours. </p>
<p> We found that the amount of bacteria transferred to either kind of food didn’t depend much on how long the food was in contact with the contaminated surface – whether for a few seconds or for a whole minute. The overall amount of bacteria on the surface mattered more, and this decreased over time after the initial inoculation. It looks like what’s at issue is less how long your food languishes on the floor and much more how infested with bacteria that patch of floor happens to be. </p>
<p> We also found that the kind of surface made a difference as well. Carpets, for instance, seem to be slightly better places to drop your food than wood or tile. When carpet was inoculated with Salmonella, less than 1% of the bacteria were transferred. But when the food was in contact with tile or wood, 48%-70% of bacteria transferred. </p>
<p> Last year, a study from from Aston University in the UK used nearly identical parameters to our study and found similar results testing contact times of three and 30 seconds on similar surfaces. They also reported that 87% of people asked either would eat or have eaten food dropped on the floor. </p>
<p> Should You Eat Food That’s Fallen On The Floor? </p>
<p> From a food safety standpoint, if you have millions or more cells on a surface, 0.1% is still enough to make you sick. Also, certain types of bacteria are extremely virulent, and it takes only a small amount to make you sick. For example, 10 cells or less of an especially virulent strain of E. coli can cause severe illness and death in people with compromised immune systems. But the chance of these bacteria being on most surfaces is very low. </p>
<p> And it’s not just dropping food on the floor that can lead to bacterial contamination. Bacteria are carried by various “media,” which can include raw food, moist surfaces where bacteria has been left, our hands or skin and from coughing or sneezing. </p>
<p> Hands, foods and utensils can carry individual bacterial cells, colonies of cells or cells living in communities contained within a protective film that provide protection. These microscopic layers of deposits containing bacteria are known as biofilms and they are found on most surfaces and objects. </p>
<p> Biofilm communities can harbor bacteria longer and are very difficult to clean. Bacteria in these communities also have an enhanced resistance to sanitizers and antibiotics compared to bacteria living on their own. </p>
<p> So the next time you consider eating dropped food, the odds are in your favor that you can eat that morsel and not get sick. But in the rare chance that there is a microorganism that can make you sick on the exact spot where the food dropped, you can be fairly sure the bug is on the food you are about to put in your mouth. </p>
<p> Research (and common sense) tell us that the best thing to do is to keep your hands, utensils and other surfaces clean. </p>

<p> Why Do I Have to Relieve Myself Immediately After Eating? </p>
<p> Do you ever have to rush to the bathroom after eating? Sometimes it can feel like food “goes right through you.” But does it really? </p>
<p> In short, no. </p>
<p> When you feel the need to relieve yourself right after eating, it’s not your most recent bite that sends you rushing to the toilet. </p>
<p> Digestion time varies from person to person. Your age, sex, and any health conditions you may have also affects digestion. </p>
<p> Generally, it takes about 2 to 5 days from eating for food to pass through your body as stool, estimates the Mayo Clinic. </p>
<p> However, since multiple factors are involved in the digestive process, it’s difficult to give a good estimate of digestion time. Women also tend to digest their food slower than men. </p>
<p> The entire digestive system can be up to 30 feet long in adults — much too long for food to pass right through you. What’s most likely happening to you is something called the gastrocolic reflex. </p>
<p> The gastrocolic reflex is a normal reaction the body has to eating food in varying intensities. </p>
<p> When food hits your stomach, your body releases certain hormones. These hormones tell your colon to contract to move food through your colon and out of your body. This makes room for more food. </p>
<p> The effects of this reflex can be mild, moderate, or severe. They can also vary from person to person. </p>
<p> Some people experience this reflex more frequently and more intensely than others. </p>
<p> Research has shown that certain digestive disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), speed up the movement of food through the colon after eating. </p>
<p> Certain foods and digestive disorders may trigger particularly strong or long lasting effects of gastrocolic reflex. These include: </p>
<p> When these disorders worsen your gastrocolic reflex, you’ll usually experience some other symptoms, like: </p>
<p> bloating that’s relieved or partially relieved by passing gas or having a bowel movement </p>
<p> Sometimes you might feel an urgent need to poop that isn’t related to your gastrocolic reflex. This could be the case when you have diarrhea. </p>
<p> Usually, diarrhea lasts just a few days. When it lasts for weeks, it could be a sign of an infection or digestive disorder. Common causes of diarrhea include: </p>
<p> viruses </p>
<p> bacteria and parasites, from eating contaminated food or by not properly washing your hands </p>
<p> Fecal incontinence can also cause an urgent need to poop. Those with incontinence can’t control their bowel movements. Sometimes stool leaks from the rectum with little to no warning. </p>
<p> Incontinence could range from leaking a bit of stool when passing gas to a complete loss of control over the bowels. Unlike with gastrocolic reflex, a person with incontinence might unexpectedly poop at any time, whether or not they’ve recently eaten. </p>
<p> Some common causes of incontinence include: </p>
<p> Muscle damage to the rectum. This can happen during childbirth, from chronic constipation, or from some surgeries. </p>
<p> Damage to the nerves in the rectum. It could either be the nerves that sense stool in your rectum or those that control your anal sphincter. Childbirth, straining during bowel movements, spinal cord injuries, stroke, or certain diseases like diabetes can cause this nerve damage. </p>
<p> Diarrhea. It’s harder to keep in the rectum than loose stool. </p>
<p> Damage to the rectal walls. This reduces how much stool can be retained. </p>
<p> While it’s not possible to prevent gastrocolic reflex, there are things you can do to make it easier to live with. </p>
<p> First, take note of when you experience the gastrocolic reflex and what you’ve eaten before it happens. </p>
<p> If you notice a pattern between eating certain foods and your gastrocolic reflex becoming stronger, chances are that avoiding those foods will help reduce its intensity. </p>
<p> Some common trigger foods include: </p>
<p> dairy </p>
<p> high fiber foods, like whole grains and vegetables </p>
<p> greasy and fatty foods, such as fries </p>
<p> Stress is another common trigger for gastrocolic reflex. Managing your stress can help you manage your gastrocolic reflex. Try these 16 ways to relieve stress. </p>
<p> Most people experience the effects of the gastrocolic reflex from time to time. </p>
<p> See your doctor if you experience an ongoing change in your bowel habits, or if you’re constantly running to the toilet after eating. They can figure out the underlying cause and get you the right treatment. </p>

<p> What Could Really Happen If You Eat Rodent-Infected Food? </p>
<p> On second thought, maybe skip the cheese plate tonight. Photo: Ju-Lia/Getty Images </p>
<p> The biggest restaurant story of April: rodents, specifically the rats that shut down a Dunkin’ Donuts in midtown and, of course, the lone mouse spotted at Dominique Ansel Bakery that ultimately led to a Health Department shutdown of the Cronut palace. (Not to mention that rat running around the subway car.) Anything involving rodents has an inherent ick value, but every New Yorker knows dealing with them is also part of life in the city. So we wondered: What’s the worst that could happen to you if you actually ate rodent-infected food? Sure, it’s gross, but is it truly dangerous? </p>
<p> Officially, the CDC lists seven diseases North American rats and mice transmit directly and 11 they transmit indirectly. None sounds good, and several can kill you. Theoretically, food or liquid served with any living bacterium or virus puts you at risk of catching something, and essentially the only thing New York rats won’t eat is rodent poison — worth noting: the pioneering rodentologist Martin Schein claimed scrambled eggs are a favorite food — so it’s really not like one pantry food, if rodent-accessible, is safer than another. Foodborne disease is transmitted through saliva, urine, and droppings. In the course of one day’s food rummaging, a rat can unload 50 half-inch droppings. </p>
<p> Without even including the millions of mice in NYC, some estimates say rats alone outnumber New Yorkers 2 to 1 in the city. The two rat species native to New York (Norway and black) carry things that sound like they’d appear in scenes from The Walking Dead: hemorrhagic fever, rat-bite fever, salmonellosis, leptospirosis, and listeriosis. The good news is that, while restaurant rodent infestations are uncomfortably common, outbreaks of these rodent-borne diseases are not. But the bottom line is that contamination by rodent is still a possibility in New York, even if the odds are low. From a worst-case-scenario perspective, here’s what you could get the next time you bite into a dirty doughnut: </p>
<p> Dander and hair allergies: Studies suggest a quarter of us may be allergic to rodents, and some researchers consider mice a leading cause, if not the leading cause, of asthma. For this to really mess you up, though, you’d need a bad rodent allergy and food that was absolutely covered in dander or hair. </p>
<p> Leptospirosis: You get this bacterial infection from foods or liquids splashed with rodent urine. It doesn’t matter what kind of rodent, as long as the pee stays moist on the food. Nine in ten people get rough but manageable symptoms (headaches, fever, diarrhea), making it look deceptively flulike. For one infected person in ten, though, it can cause “multiorgan failure.” </p>
<p> Rat-Bite Fever: Don’t be tricked by the name; you don’t really need to be bit. It also comes in a foodborne version called Haverhill fever, after a Massachusetts town where infected rats tainted the milk. It’s rare, but scientists have learned it’s frighteningly fatal in at-risk groups, as high as 53 percent, even. In fact, a San Diego boy died last summer after he was bitten by his pet rat Oreo. </p>
<p> Hantavirsuses: Internal bleeding is the hallmark symptom of these viruses, which are carried by rodents, but are transmissible by food and airborne contact. Doctors used to think infections couldn’t move person-to-person, but recent research shows that’s probably wrong, so (in theory) a sick rat in a trap could potentially infect an employee, who could in turn give it to customers before their appetizers even arrived. Any food is at risk if it is not stored in rodentproof containers, one of the many reasons the DOH requires storage in rodentproof containers at least six inches off the floor. </p>

<p> Should I Worry if My Urine Smells of the Food I Just Ate? </p>
<p> Normal urine has a clear yellow color and a slight ammonia smell. Urine forms when your kidneys filter excess water from your bloodstream, along with waste byproducts. As red blood cells age, hemoglobin in the cells breaks down and forms a yellow compound called urochrome, giving urine its yellow tint. Some compounds in foods and medicines temporarily give urine unusual colors and odors. Most urine odors mark changes in diet but not changes in health 1. </p>
<p> Food Odors </p>
<p> Not all foods pass odors along to your urine. Foods that do include asparagus, coffee and some spices. Asparagus, one of the worst offenders, gives the urine of most people a foul, sulfurous stench. Not everyone who eats asparagus experiences the same effects, leading researchers to suspect that either some people can't smell the compounds or not all people produce the smell. If the odor of your urine corresponds to the smell of food you recently ate, in most cases you shouldn't worry. Some specific odors could indicate medical problems. </p>

<p> Sweet Urine </p>
<p> If your pancreas works properly, sugar in the blood triggers a flood of insulin needed to process the fuel. In diabetics, insufficient insulin causes blood sugar to rise. Excess sugar gives your urine a sweet smell. Urine that smells like maple sugar could mark a rare genetic disorder called maple sugar urine disease. Victims of MSUD lack the enzymes needed for breaking down some amino acids. The unusable amino acids leave the body through the urine, giving it a maple sugar odor. MSUD usually manifests in infancy. If you're an adult in good health, you're not at risk, but if the disease runs in your family, you could carry the gene responsible for the condition. </p>

<p> Foul Odors </p>
<p> Some medications such as antibiotics might add odd odors and strange colors to urine. If you're taking prescription medicine and note unusual urine qualities, ask your doctor whether the drug causes these side effects. B-complex vitamins give urine a harmless, odd smell and a surprising yellowish-green murky color. Foods such as beets and blackberries temporarily color your urine. Dark urine in any shade of red or purple, unrelated to food, might signal internal bleeding from a urinary infection. Bad odors sometimes accompany these problems, along with pain in the lower back or painful urination. Liver disease could give your urine an unusual musty odor. </p>

<p> Other Odors </p>
<p> If you don't drink enough water, your urine could acquire a cloudy yellow color and an ammonia smell. Waste products concentrate in the urine as your body dehydrates and excretes less water. When you drink enough water -- about eight glasses a day in normal conditions -- your urine appears light yellow and clear, with less ammonia odor. If you notice the smell of feces when you urinate, this could mark a serious internal disorder called diverticulosis. Abnormal pouches forming on the walls of your intestines could connect to your bladder through a growth called a fistula. Report any consistent changes in urine color and odor to your doctor 1. </p>

<p> What’s Causing This Stomachache After I Eat? </p>
<p> We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process. </p>
<p> Overview </p>
<p> Are your eyes bigger than your stomach? Nearly everyone has overindulged at one time or another, leading to indigestion, fullness, and nausea. But if you’re experiencing stomach pain when eating normal amounts of food, it could be a sign of a problem. </p>
<p> Most causes of stomachache and indigestion aren’t serious and don’t require medical attention. Mild stomach upset can usually be treated at home with over-the-counter (OTC) medications. </p>
<p> But if your pain is moderate or severe, you should talk to your doctor. Your symptoms could be a sign of a serious underlying condition. </p>
<p> There are many reasons why your stomach might hurt after eating. Read on to learn more. </p>
<p> There are many different types of stomach pain and upset. You’ve probably experienced many of them before. </p>
<p> If you or someone you know is having severe stabbing pain, it could be a medical emergency. You should consult with a doctor right away. </p>
<p> Dehydration is also a medical emergency. If you’re unable to consume liquids without vomiting or are having severe and persistent diarrhea, you may need to go to the emergency room for intravenous (IV) fluids. </p>
<p> There are several potential causes for stomach pain after you eat. These include: </p>
<p> Food allergies </p>
<p> Food allergies occur when your body mistakes a certain food for a harmful foreign invader and your immune system releases antibodies to fight it. This immune response can cause an array of symptoms, including stomach pain. Common food allergies include: </p>
<p> Many people experience lactose intolerance, which means that milk and other dairy products give them symptoms of stomach upset. </p>
<p> Celiac disease </p>
<p> Celiac disease is when your body has an immune response to gluten — a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. With repeated exposure, it causes damage to the lining of the small intestine. This causes symptoms of stomach upset and can lead to other serious complications. </p>
<p> GERD </p>
<p> Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic (long-lasting) digestive condition in which stomach acid comes back up into your esophagus. This acid reflux irritates the lining of your esophagus and can cause damage. </p>
<p> Crohn’s disease </p>
<p> Crohn’s disease is a serious, chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It causes inflammation in different parts of the digestive tract, which can lead to severe pain, diarrhea, and bloody stools, along with other symptoms. It’s a serious condition with potentially life-threatening complications. </p>
<p> Peptic ulcers </p>
<p> Peptic ulcers are sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper part of your small intestine (duodenum). The most common symptom of an ulcer is a burning stomach pain. This pain can be aggravated by spicy foods. </p>
<p> Sugar alcohols </p>
<p> Sugar alcohols, which oddly contain neither sugar nor alcohol, are artificial sweeteners used in many sugar-free gums and candies. Sugar alcohols, like sorbitol, are food additives regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some people find that they cause digestive distress. The FDA warns that excessive consumption of sorbitol can have a “laxative effect.” </p>
<p> Constipation </p>
<p> Constipation happens when stool moves too slowly through the digestive tract and cannot be eliminated normally. Chronic constipation — several weeks with three or fewer bowel movements — can cause stomach pain and bloating. After you eat, when your body is trying to digest new food, your symptoms may get worse. </p>
<p> Your doctor might be able to diagnose the cause of your stomach pain just by listening to you describe your symptoms. Sometimes, however, more invasive tests may be necessary. This could include: </p>
<p> If you suspect that you have a food intolerance, then trial and error is often the best way to identify it. You may want to keep a food diary to keep track of your symptoms. Your doctor might also recommend an elimination diet. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing stomach pain after eating, you may already have tried a few at-home treatments. If you haven’t found anything that works, it could be because you haven’t pinpointed the right underlying cause. </p>
<p> Ultimately, treatment for stomach pain will depend on what’s causing it. If you think you may have a food allergy, you should be evaluated by an allergist for correct diagnosis. If you have a food intolerance, you should try to avoid that food as much as possible. </p>
<p> A lactose-free diet may sound unappealing at first, but there are ways to make it work. You might want to consider seeing a nutritionist or picking up a cookbook with lactose-free recipes. If you think you may have an issue with gluten, you shouldn’t go gluten-free until you’ve been evaluated by a gastroenterologist and celiac disease has been ruled out. Testing for celiac disease should be done while on a diet which contains gluten. </p>
<p> Many of the uncomfortable symptoms of post-meal stomach pain can be managed with OTC medications. As always, talk to your doctor before starting any new medication, even if it doesn’t require a prescription. </p>
<p> Here are a few treatment options that you can find at your local pharmacy: </p>
<p> Simethicone (Gas-X) helps relieve uncomfortable bloating. </p>
<p> Antacids (Alka-Seltzer, Rolaids, Tums) neutralize stomach acid to reduce burning feelings. </p>
<p> Acid-reducers (Pepcid) reduce the production of stomach acid for up to 12 hours. </p>
<p> Beano helps prevent gas. </p>
<p> Antidiarrheals (Imodium) stop diarrhea and its associated symptoms. </p>
<p> Lansoprazole and omeprazole (Prevacid, Prilosec) block acid production and help heal the esophagus when taken daily. </p>
<p> Pepto-Bismol coats the lining of the esophagus to reduce burning and treat nausea and diarrhea. </p>
<p> Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) fights symptoms associated with an allergic immune response and helps treat nausea and vomiting. </p>
<p> Acetaminophen (Tylenol) relieves pain without irritating the stomach like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen can. </p>
<p> Probiotics aid in overall digestive health by introducing more good bacteria into your system. </p>
<p> Fiber supplements (Metamucil, Benefiber) help produce normal bowel movements and prevent constipation, though they can cause gas and bloating. </p>
<p> Possible complications will depend on what’s causing your stomach pain. Food allergies can lead to a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which can cause you to stop breathing. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. </p>
<p> GERD can result in damage to the esophagus that causes difficulty swallowing. Peptic ulcers can lead to internal bleeding and serious infections. Chronic constipation can lead to hemorrhoids and anal fissures, among other problems. </p>
<p> Crohn’s disease is associated with the most serious complications, including bowel obstructions and fistulas that require surgical repair. It can also increase your risk of colon cancer. </p>
<p> There are several things you may be able to do to prevent stomach pain after eating. </p>
<p> There are a lot of things that could be causing your stomach to hurt after eating. It’s likely that you have common indigestion or heartburn and will benefit from OTC medications. But if your symptoms have persisted for several weeks, you may have a chronic condition and should consult your doctor as soon as possible. </p>

<p> What It Could Mean If You Have Stomach Cramps After Eating </p>
<p> Stomach cramps after eating are the absolute worst. Many of us can agree that eating something delicious is (or should be) the best part of the day! Even if you don’t take special joy in food or spend a ton of your time deciding what to cook for dinner, eating is something we have to deal with as part and parcel of living as human beings. So if you get stomach cramps after eating, you’re probably determined to make them stop ASAP. </p>
<p> It’s worth noting that experiencing some cramps in your midsection after eating can be no big deal as long as it doesn’t happen often. “Having an occasional belly ache is not a problem—it’s essentially normal,” William Chey, M.D., professor of medicine at the University of Michigan, director of the GI Physiology Laboratory, and codirector of the Michigan Bowel Control Program, tells SELF. But consistently feeling like your stomach is tying itself into knots after you eat isn’t normal, and it can have an impact that lasts long after you’ve left the table (or the couch). Not only are stomach cramps painful at the time, but persistent ones can make you apprehensive every time you try to eat, particularly when it’s unclear why the cramps are happening and what you can do to try to relieve the pain. </p>
<p> Keep reading to learn why it can be hard to know what’s causing your stomach cramps after eating, how the digestive process may factor in, and the most common causes of abdominal cramps after eating—plus what you can do about them. </p>
<p> First up: Is it actually your stomach that hurts? </p>
<p> Before we get into the most common causes of a crampy middle after eating, let’s clear up something many of us have been unknowingly getting wrong since we were kids. When you say your stomach hurts, chances are you’re talking about the part of your torso between your chest and your hips. This part of your body is technically your abdomen. Your stomach starts a bit under your chest on your left side and extends down into the middle of your torso. (Check out this diagram from the Mayo Clinic to get a better idea.) </p>
<p> It’s no surprise, then, that figuring out exactly what hurts in this general area can be tricky. “There are organs that overlap,” Nitin Ahuja, M.D., M.S., assistant professor of clinical medicine in the gastroenterology department in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, tells SELF. “The small intestine occupies a lot of space, and the colon [the large intestine] sort of drapes around the entire abdomen and overlaps [part] of the stomach as well.” </p>
<p> Also, depending on what is going on, the nerves in the abdomen may not be “as good at localizing pain,” Dr. Ahuja says, so it might be hard to tell where the pain is coming from. Keep all of this in mind as you try to figure out what might be causing your post-eating cramps. Now, for the next bit of background information you need to know, since high school biology was a long time ago for some of us… </p>
<p> Here’s how the digestive system works. </p>
<p> Or how digestion should work when everything goes according to plan. </p>
<p> Your body employs multiple organs to turn the food you eat into energy. When everything is going well, you should barely notice this process, which is good because it can actually take a pretty long time. The Mayo Clinic estimates that it takes two to five days for a mouthful of food to go through all the various digestive processes and come out the other end looking unrecognizable. </p>
<p> First, though, this all starts with one bite. Between the chewing action of your mouth and the enzymes and lubrication from your saliva, you start to break down what you’re eating, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) explains. Once the bite is small enough to swallow, your tongue pushes it to the back of your throat into your esophagus, which begins to contract automatically in a motion called peristalsis. </p>
<p> The first organ the newly chewed food encounters after this is the stomach. Muscles in your stomach walls churn the food and release acid and enzymes, slowly mixing the food into a paste called chyme. Your stomach gradually releases the chyme into the small intestine, which reduces it further by mixing it with enzymes from the pancreas and from bacteria, along with bile from the liver, all while pushing the chyme further through the digestive tract. The walls of the small intestine absorb the extracted nutrients and water, which move into your bloodstream. </p>
<p> Even getting to this point can take an impressive six to eight hours. Once the small intestine has gotten everything useful it can from the food, the waste products move into the large intestine. For the next 36 hours or so, the large intestine absorbs water from the waste products and turns what’s left into stool, which moves to the rectum (the end part of the large intestine) through more peristalsis. It waits there until you suddenly have the urge to go, at which point it is passed out in a bowel movement. Try not to think about that at lunch. </p>
<p> Now, here’s why you might be dealing with abdominal cramps after eating. You’ve got the anatomical and digestive basics down. Here’s what might be up with your abdomen: </p>
<p> 1. You might have eaten more than your stomach could handle. </p>
<p> Experts say this tends to be the most common cause for this specific type of discomfort. “I’m sure all of us have had that situation where we’ve eaten too much and we get stomach cramps,” Suneeta Krishnareddy, M.D., M.S., assistant professor of medicine in the faculty of digestive and liver diseases at Columbia University Medical Center, tells SELF. “It’s usually just caused by the stomach stretching—because it is a very stretchy organ—because there’s too much food in there.” This stomach stretching can also happen because of the bacteria in your G.I. tract trying to help you break down the food, which can cause gas and distension, Dr. Krishnareddy says. “That stretch in some people causes pain or cramping,” she explains. </p>
<p> To be super clear, we’re not saying there’s anything inherently wrong with sometimes eating “a lot” (and that definition varies from person to person). Eating past the point of fullness on some occasions can actually be part of having a normal relationship with food. And, of course, if you deal with a disordered eating issue like binge eating disorder, navigating how much you eat can be really complex and not feel entirely under your control right now. So, seriously, no judgment here. But if you’re dealing with stomach cramps after eating often and think it’s because you have a hard time not eating past the point of fullness, talking to a doctor, therapist, or registered dietitian may help. </p>
<p> 2. You might have a food intolerance. </p>
<p> If you find that your cramps keep happening after you eat certain things, you might have an intolerance to a specific food substance. Common culprits of intolerances are foods that are designated as fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), “which is a fancy designation for poorly-digested carbohydrates,” Dr. Ahuja says. Examples include fruits like apples and pears, veggies like cauliflower and lentils, and dairy products. In fact, trouble processing lactose (the sugar in dairy) is the most common type of food intolerance, according to the Cleveland Clinic. </p>
<p> In addition to getting abdominal pain when you eat that particular food, you might also deal with symptoms like nausea, bloating, gas, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, and more, the Cleveland Clinic says. And keep in mind that different people can be intolerant to the same food to different extents. For example, Dr. Krishnareddy explains, someone who is mildly lactose intolerant may be able to digest cheese and yogurt but not a milky latte, whereas someone with a severe intolerance may not be able to digest any form of dairy very well. </p>
<p> 3. You might have a food allergy. </p>
<p> A food allergy is a step up in severity from a food intolerance. If you have an allergic reaction to a food, it means your immune system has mistakenly identified that food as a potentially harmful invader and mounted a defense against it, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) explains. That immune system defense is what leads to symptoms like abdominal cramping, a tingly or itchy mouth, hives and overall bodily itching, facial swelling, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and even potentially life-threatening trouble breathing. </p>
<p> According to the AAAAI, the most common food allergens are proteins in cow’s milk, eggs, peanuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, and tree nuts. If you notice you’re constantly dealing with pretty intense symptom flare-ups after eating these (or other) foods, an allergy could be to blame. </p>
<p> 4. You might have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). </p>
<p> On top of abdominal pains (that sometimes happen after a meal and may get better once you poop), symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome can include excess gas, bloating, diarrhea or constipation (or alternating periods of both), and seeing mucus in your stool, according to the Mayo Clinic. </p>
<p> It’s not clear exactly what causes IBS, but there are a few theories. People with IBS may have abnormalities in how their brains and guts interact that lead to digestive problems and pain, the NIDDK explains. </p>
<p> This can manifest in a few different ways. Dr. Chey says that people with IBS may have large intestines that contract more strongly and more frequently when they eat a meal than other people’s, which can then cause abdominal pain and other issues. Another theory is that people with IBS are “extra sensitive to the stretch that is normal in the intestines from the breakdown of food products,” Dr. Krishnareddy says. </p>
<p> 5. You might have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). </p>
<p> IBD is an umbrella term for two conditions that both cause chronic inflammation of various parts of the digestive tract: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. People with either type of IBD often experience periods of remission followed by flare-ups, according to the Mayo Clinic. </p>
<p> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains that Crohn’s disease usually affects the part of the small intestine that meets the large intestine, but the characteristic patches of inflammation it causes can be anywhere from the mouth to the rectum and seep through multiple layers of the G.I. lining. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, affects continuous portions of the large intestine and/or rectum, with the innermost lining becoming inflamed. </p>
<p> If you have Crohn’s disease, you’re likely to deal with abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and weight loss, and might also have additional symptoms like fatigue, nausea, joint pain, and anemia, the NIDDK says. With ulcerative colitis, the most common symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea (specifically containing blood or pus), the NIDDK notes, though you may also have issues such as fatigue, nausea, anemia, and an urgent need to use the bathroom. (As you can tell, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis can have pretty similar symptoms.) </p>
<p> If your abdominal cramps are making life miserable, try to talk to a doctor. </p>
<p> Treatments for the above issues can vary wildly. For instance, if you think the issue is that you have a hard time processing beans, which then leads to painful gas, over-the-counter medications like simethicone (the active ingredient in products like Gas-X) may help with the distension that causes your pain, Dr. Krishnareddy explains. </p>
<p> However, if you’re experiencing cramps that are pretty severe, along with other symptoms that make you think you might have a chronic issue like IBS or IBD, it’s really important to try to consult with a doctor—particularly because taking over-the-counter medications won’t treat the real issue at hand. </p>
<p> “These medications can decrease the symptoms just enough that the person doesn’t go to their doctor to get evaluated,” Dr. Krishnareddy says. “But it’s not actually [addressing] the underlying problem.” </p>
<p> Ultimately, if getting abdominal cramps after eating is affecting your life, it’s time to consult the professionals. “If you’re having symptoms that are occurring frequently enough to interfere with your ability to conduct your daily activities, you need to see a doctor,” Dr. Chey confirms. This is especially true, he says, if you’re having serious symptoms like vomiting (with or without blood), seeing blood in your stool (which can sometimes look like tar instead of being red), or inexplicably losing weight. </p>
<p> Even if your cramps come without these types of symptoms, it’s good to look for an explanation if you’re dealing with them persistently. “In many cases—especially with Crohn’s—it’s just a vague abdominal pain, which is why it takes so long to reach a diagnosis,” Dr. Krishnareddy says. “That’s why I always tell people if you feel anything is wrong with you, or out of the ordinary, it’s always better to get checked out by your doctor.” </p>
<p> Trust your gut when it tells you something’s wrong. At the very least, your doctor should be able to ask you some questions that get you closer to figuring out what’s going on. </p>

<p> Suddenly Weak, shaky, hot feeling, feels better after eating? </p>
<p> New Member </p>
<p> I was wondering if anyone else had this sometimes. Sometimes i'll get it a couple times a week, sometimes not for weeks at a time. It comes on really suddenly and I feel weak, shaky, like I have hotflashes and eating seems to help. If I eat something, in a few minutes it will subside. I'm not diabetic and I've been tested for hypoglycemia and it's not that either. Just wondering if this is anothe part of CFS? Thanks! </p>
<p> New Member </p>
<p> (Love your screen name, by the way!) I have the same symptoms as you. I also do not have diabetes but have never been tested for hypoglycemia so I don't know about that one. And I never thought to link it to FMS or CFS. Does anyone else have thoughts on this? I'd love to hear it. Pup </p>
<p> New Member </p>
<p> Mild hypoglycimia doesn't always show up in blood tests. Best way to find out is eliminate ALL unrefind carbs, including fruit and fruit juices, ALL "white and fluffies" like white flour, potatoes, sugar, ect, for at least two weeks. Basically, go on some form of low carb diet. I used to get very similar feelings, and still do if I don't stay away from unrefined carbs. I can eat fruits and low carb or whole grain breads, as long as they don't contain any form of sugar (corn syrup, honey, ect.), and I eat lots of veggies. Now I can go hours past the usual time for me to eat without ill effects, where as before, I couldn't go more than 20 minutes! Certainly, ask your doc about it, as it could be something else, but just thought I'd let you know my experiance. Meg </p>

<p> your blood sugar dropped. That is the feeling you get. People can have a drop in blood sugar who do not have hypoglycemia. Do you remember what you ate before the "spell". I am hypoglycemic and before I knew what it was, I called those feelings my spell. Take care, Donna </p>

<p> This morning I ate a pancake and a piece of sausage. I can't really tell if what I eat plays a part in it being better or worse. As far as staying away from carbs, argh! I think I would die if I couldn't eat potatoes. I tried the Atlkins Diet one time and after a few days I felt like I was going to hurt someone if I couldn't eat some potatoes or bread or something. </p>
<p> New Member </p>
<p> New Member </p>
<p> Are you sure you don't mean REFINED carbs, not UNREFINED? Staying away from refined carbs is avoiding things like white sugar/flour, etc. Pup </p>
<p> New Member </p>
<p> I was tested years ago and found that I wasnt. Then about a year ago I kept getting these wierd dizzy spells I went to one doctor who said I had high blood sugar (diabetes) but when I say the Endocronologist she said no, I had hypoglaucemia but that many hypo patients end up being diabetics type II patients. So be real careful with your diet. I agree on the potato thing. I cant stay away from potatoes, breads, yellow corn etc. I try to eat in moderation of these things as I hear thats my bad part.. but I just take it as it comes and drink a hot soda (coke) and I feel better. Did you know thats a quicker way than orange juice to raise your sugar? Yep, my partner is diabetic she has been to several classes on Type II Diabetes. Good Luck & keep us posted GEL </p>

<p> that it really sounds like low blood sugar. lots of people with FM have it. i had been tested several times, and each time my doctor said i was normal. now that i have a copy of my file to read myself, i see that i tested on the low side of normal EVERY TIME. she never mentioned that. she never explained the numbers to me. But if the normal range for that blood test was 3.4-6.8, i was a 3.4. don't skip meals! i keep an apple and a granola bar in my bag all the time. they don't go bad, and then i don't have to remember to grab something everytime i leave the house. </p>

<p> blood sugar problems to me.............despite what the test results showed. CHROMIUM PICOLONATE! Worked wonders for me with these kind of symptoms..........it regulates blood sugar levels. If you feel better after you eat..........this is the biggest clue that it probably has something to do with your sugar levels. The doctor should have picked up on that one. My Chromium levels were very low. My Doctor had it checked when I told him the symptoms that you are describing.............most invarably......I felt better after eating. I took 200-400mcg a day.

<p> I used to get this often - what felt like a catastrophic drop in blood sugar but I have a blood sugar monitor in my surgery and when I tested myself all was ok . It is indeed part of CFS - I have read about it being a symptom . Lots of small meals rather than 3 large ones can help balance things . Richard </p>

<p> Ditto what everyone else has said in regards to low blood sugar - these are classic signs. When you said that you went on Atkins and after a few days you were ready to murder someone? That my friend is called 'withdrawal'...which to me says that these foods high in sugar and carbs (baked potatoes are like soooo bad because they release more sugar cooking!). What you really need to look into is a balanced diet where protein is at the top of the pyramid, good fats in the middle (these two things alone keep you feeling full...as well as keeping your blood sugar in balance. Good carbs (ie vegetables that are low in sugar) make up the rest. Getting on track so that your blood sugar has evened out is so important! Do you find that after you have had refined carbs that you are also ravenous a little while later - like going through the fridge and cupboard looking for anything 'good' to get your hands on? Because this - this is addiction to sugar. I have been doing my own version I guess you could call it, of Atkins....on top of weight loss - I literally have to remind myself to eat, because the protein and fat are keeping me going and full. Meanwhile, if I have a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast - within 2 hours I am absolutely starving. (So much for it sticking to your ribs! More to my waist, butt, thighs...). If you like nuts, they are a good source of protein (although a bit higher in carbs - peanuts are lower...and nice macadamia nuts are very low carb as well. Protein and fat are for endurance over the day, whilst carbs will give you that quick boost followed by a crash. A. </p>

<p> PLEASE READ!!!! REACTIVE HYPOGLYCEMIA: Extremely common with ME/CFS! The easiest way to remember what to eat and how to eat, is to follow a DIABETIC DIET. I was having fainting spells, jittery fingers and even seizures like nothing else! I was tested and tested, and doctors said I did not have hypoglycemia. Then I did a timed glucose monitoring test (MUCH more complex than a regular basic blood test) and after not eating anything, then drinking a large amount of sugar water (like the amount in a soda or a tall orange juice etc.,) they found that I had very low blood sugar then it spiked very high after the sugar water, then after the spike, it plummeted dangerously low. Hence "Reactive Hypoglycemia." It causes major major problems in the body and brain, even days after, when you feel like "normal" again. It causes neuropathy for days, and headaches, emotional upsets and extra fatigue. It changed my life, I am not kidding here, to just eat a strict Diabetic diet. Low carb is best, but DON'T EAT TOO LOW of carbs. The body needs some for sure, glucose is fuel for the brain. About 25 carbs per meal tends to be pretty good, especially if they are "complex" carbs, eaten with high protein and fiber. Anything you can do to slow the digestion process of teh carbs. Even eat a little fat with your meals. It helps a lot. Stay away from liquids with sugar too, as the liquid goes rapidly into the blood. It all sounds like a lot, but you will get it all down pretty quickly if you commit to it. You will likely feel MUCH BETTER too!! Please please please give it a shot. I have never said this in this forum ever, saying pleeeease like this. But I promise you, longterm diabetic diets for people like us is extremely helpful. I PROMISE YOU. You will get a lot of misinformed advice (no offense to anyone, truly!!!!) but I promise you, this will help you with hypoglycemia issues. A healthy Diabetic diet! Pleeeease consider it!! </p>

<p> That sudden urge to poop your pants after eating and what you can do about it </p>
<p> Healthy Living </p>
<p> Have you ever experienced having to go to the bathroom right after eating, had digestion issues midway through a meal, or even gotten a whiff of coffee and had to go? Diarrhea immediately after eating is a symptom of several disorders that could be affecting your bowel movements. </p>
<p> You may think experiencing diarrhea immediately after eating your meal is caused by indulging in fast foods, but SuReceta’s integrative medicine expert, Dr. Joseph Mosquera asserts otherwise. </p>
<p> “Those sudden bathroom trips you may be experiencing are most likely symptoms of an underlying condition that happen to be exacerbated by poor food choices,” says Dr. Mosquera. </p>
<p> I did some research and partnered up with Dr. Joseph Mosquera to suss out the details of what could be triggering the need to poop right after eating, and what can be done to stop it. </p>
<p> First, let’s backtrack a little to learn about what gives us the urge to go to the bathroom in the first place. </p>
<p> The gastrocolic reflex </p>
<p> The all too familiar “trigger” sensation we feel to go to the bathroom is called the gastrocolic reflex. Once we begin eating, and have food moving into the stomach, the stomach signals the brain to in turn signal the colon to move out stuff because more stuff is coming down the pipe. </p>
<p> Once we begin eating, and have food moving into the stomach, the stomach signals the brain to in turn signal the colon to move out stuff because more stuff is coming down the pipe. </p>
<p> “Now people naturally have different gastrocolic reflexes,” explains Dr. Mosquera, “but this reflex can be affected by a number of factors from a food allergy to just feeling anxious.” </p>

<p> The Gastrocolic Reflex: “Food Goes Right Through Me!” </p>
<p> By Sara Ringer </p>

<p> Have you ever eaten a meal and almost right after you’ve eaten it you are rushing to the bathroom to have a bowel movement? You’ve probably used the phrase, food goes right through me! Many patients who live with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis have experienced this phenomenon. </p>
<p> Does food go right through you? </p>
<p> Let’s think about it: There are about 25 feet of the intestine in the digestive tract. If you ate a slice of pizza and stood up to go to the bathroom 5 minutes later, would it really be the pizza that had reached the end of your digestive system? Did it just go right through you? </p>
<p> The pizza would have had to travel through your esophagus, stomach, and 25 feet of intestine all in 5 minutes which would be some sort of record transit time. Even though you just ate a meal and had to use the bathroom shortly after, the food did not travel all the way through your digestive system in that short amount of time. </p>
<p> Why do you use the bathroom immediately after eating? </p>
<p> If you are eating a meal and very shortly afterward you need to use the bathroom, the cause is usually the gastrocolic reflex. The gastrocolic reflex is a reflex that stimulates contractions in the colon that can lead to using the bathroom shortly after eating a meal. </p>
<p> Basically the stomach and the colon are communicating1 - once the food you have just eaten reaches the stomach, the stomach sends a message to the colon to make room because more food is coming. The colon, being the polite guy he is, starts contracting which pushes it’s contents further down and this is why you have a bowel movement shortly after you have eaten the meal. It’s not the food that you just ate that is coming out of you, it’s waste from food that you had eaten earlier that was already further down in the digestive tract. </p>
<p> The gastrocolic reflex involves the stomach (gastro) and the colon (colic). </p>
<p> Over-reactive gastrocolic reflex </p>
<p> Research has shown that some patients with IBS have an over-reactive gastrocolic reflex with high pressure contractions in response to meals.2 Simply eating or drinking can trigger this exaggerated reflex resulting in pain, cramping, diarrhea or constipation. Several patients with IBD have coexistent symptoms of IBS3 so this exaggerated gastrocolic reflex can occur in patients who have Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. </p>
<p> Do greasy foods make you have to go to the bathroom more often? </p>
<p> Greasy foods can trigger the gastrocolic reflex. Usually, large meals or foods that contain unhealthy fats can also increase the pressure of contractions of the gastrocolic reflex.4 This can explain why you feel like you need to use the bathroom right after you eat fried or greasy foods. </p>
<p> So there you have it! The reason why you feel like you have to use the bathroom shortly after eating is because of the gastrocolic reflex. Needing to use the bathroom right after eating a meal can make a patient assume that food travels extremely fast through their system - that food goes right through them. </p>

<p> <p>What would then be the cause of meds I took soon after eating and had to go within 15 minutes or less and the pills were in the toilet already?</p> </p>

<p> <p>Hi <inline-mention user-id="2244246" username="hamster"/> , this could be that the pills are time release or haven&apos;t had a chance to be broken down. A good solution for this is to take vitamins and meds in liquid form if possible. Talk to your doctor and pharmacist about options. <br> <br> Brooke <br> (inflammatoryboweldisease.net Team Member)</p> </p>

<p> <p>Sorry - but I don't agree with the premise that the food can't go right thru. I know this happens because of something obvious - like corn or pimento that immediately shows up in the toilet. (foods I know could only have come from the current meal This is the same thing Hamster was saying..) Also, I've had an upper GI xray that they said could take up to 4 or 5 hours, and I was done in 15 minutes. So I know that the "going right thru me" syndrome can be very real.</p> </p>

<p> <p>I totally disagree. .It <a href='http://does.travel' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow'>does.travel</a> that fast. Have not ate salads or vegetables in four days. Had a Ceasars salad with supper last night and within 20 min was in the bathroom with cramps and D and it was evident that it was the greens. Lasted for hours of constantly running to the bathroom and cramps.</p> </p>

<p> <p>Can't be taken in liquid form. Thanks for the response. <br> They were time release, but they still should not pass through my system so quickly. <br> I got the doc to change meds and help find other ways to control my medical problems. <br> Though some cannot be fixed or lessened with lifestyle changes. <br> Less meds has help with some nasty side effects. Such as less weigh gain. &#128512;</p> </p>

<p> <p>Thanks for writing this. So interesting and this makes total sense to me. Sometimes, I get a reaction to food almost instantly after eating it and I would often think, there is no way this piece of food just travelled through my entire digestive system in a matter of seconds. <br> <br> Thanks for the read! <br> <br> Always dancing, <br> Elizabeth (team member)</p> </p>

<p> <p>I am sorry I wish this article was true but I am proof it is not. I ate beets about an hour ago and had to go to bathroom like 40 minutes later. The color was RED. And this happens ALL of the time. You can definitely see what I just ate when that happens. By the way today was the first time I ate beets in months. So sick of living this way.</p> </p>

<p> <p>I’ve tried almost everything under the sun to get rid of the painful symptoms of IBS. Starving myself by cutting out my favorite foods, taking dangerous (and expensive!) medications, drinking gallons of water to “wash it out of me” <br> ,but I still have the cramps, bloating, stomach upset and embarrassing bathroom runs that IBS throws at me! It wasn't until I stumbled upon this natural remedy I found here ( <a href='http://cure-ibs.bestips.info' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow'>http://cure-ibs.bestips.info</a> ), that my life changed completely. I'm feeling so much better now and all of symptoms of IBS are totally gone.</p> </p>

<p> Life with two children with autism and a mum that believes in miracles. </p>
<p> The reason I don’t like to eat </p>
<p> My beautiful blue eyed girl has recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder. Three years ago she was diagnosed with autism. Last week I sat with her and we talked. This is all her own words. She asked me to share so others understand. </p>
<p> Sometimes bedtime is the best time. It is the one time people leave me alone. They stop asking things like ‘are you hungry Naomi?’, ‘would you like a drink Naomi?‘, ”are you sure you don’t want a snack?’ Why do people eat and drink so much anyway? I have things I much prefer doing like watching you tube and playing my own games with my toys. How am I meant to eat or drink when I am doing something else? Sometimes people even want me to change rooms to eat. School do that. Why? I am comfortable and happy and then you make me move and my brain is thinking about where am I going, did I leave anything I might need, what if things have changed when I get back? What is someone touches anything? Those things scare me. You want me to move to somewhere, sit down and eat what you have made. But I didn’t ask for it. I did not know it was happening. No-one told me I would smell different things, hear different voices and touch different stuff and now you want me to even taste things? It is too much so I just freeze. I can hear you but everything is fuzzy. I am so scared. I am scared that people are looking at me. I am scared everyone is going to talk to me. I feel sick. </p>
<p> Why do people eat funny things? People eat things with bright colours and I can’t understand that. My body is a pinky beige colour. That is a safe colour. Like a light brown sort of colour. If my skin is ok then things that colour are ok too. </p>
<p> You want to know why I still sometimes don’t eat things that are my skin colour? Well it is just wrong. And my brain is all upset about food. When I play with my toys they look the same, they stay the same and they act the same. Sometimes I eat something and it tastes nice, it is the right colour and it fells nice and soft in my mouth. But then some days I eat what you tell me is the same and it isn’t the same. It is not the way I saw it the time I liked it. It does not have the same softness and I get upset. You ruined it. Why do people do that? I order my toys in lines so when I look at them they look the same. I feel safe like that. But you don’t let me do that with food. If I put it in order it makes sense. I want to know it is ‘right’ and I need to check it. What if it is wrong and it goes inside me? That would hurt me. </p>
<p> That is why I have to have one thing then another. My brain tells me ‘this is nugget skins’ and I remember what they taste like. You damage it if it has sauce or potatoes on. Then it is not nugget skins but some weird thing my brain does not know. So all nuggets are dangerous. And I get scared again. </p>
<p> I like soft. When I chew sometimes I get a little tiny bit to swallow and sometime a bigger bit. That means it tastes different and it does not make sense. Nibbling is safer. My teeth don’t want to touch stuff because then it tastes of teeth not what it should taste like. Teeth is not a nice flavour. You know that because no one makes anything teeth flavour do they? </p>
<p> I feel sick sometimes. Mummy says it is hunger but I don’t get it. My tummy makes me feel sick and people say it needs food when it already wants to get rid of what is in there so why add more? That does not make sense to me. </p>
<p> I don’t think people like me sometimes. They shout at me and keep making me eat. I get scared and sad, Please leave me alone. I like it best when mummy puts things I like near me when I am playing so my toys can look at it and tell me it is ok. I know my world is ok then. </p>
<p> All day long people eat eat eat. And I get scared scared and more scared. I eat at breakfast and then you want me to eat again for lunch or snack at school, then dinner, then supper. </p>
<p> I want it to end some days. That’s why bedtime is the best for me. </p>
<p> Mummy asked me if I dream about food when I sleep. No way! I dream about trains. Thomas tank engine is brilliant. He never eats and I like that! </p>

<p> Wow! This helps me with my children sooooo much. What a wonderfully articulated piece. Obviously a very intelligent young lady wrote this ❤️ I hope things get a little less scary for you as you grow. </p>
<p> Is your daughters eating disorder based on her sensitivities to how the food looks and the textures or is she making her self sick when she doesn’t like something in her mouth </p>
<p> Previous girl has given me enlightment into something I was struggling to understand </p>
<p> Unbelievably this makes sense having worked with autistic children for many years not one has ever been able to explain what eating is really like for them. We need to change the way we work and understand autism to be able to support and care more within their world and not ours. </p>

<p> The Trick to Eating Healthy When You're Eating Out, Beyond Common Sense </p>
<p> Eating at a restaurant and eating healthy are rarely complementary activities. In fact, eating out is often cited as the primary reason for an unhealthy lifestyle. But with a little knowledge and preparation, you can turn a restaurant meal from a death threat to a healthy choice. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> We're big proponents of the occasional culinary splurge, but whether you're on a diet or you just don't want to pack on extra pounds when you're on vacation, eating healthy at a restaurant is as much about common sense as it is about preparing yourself (and your stomach) to make life easy. </p>
<p> We'll cover the common sense rules you probably already know and should follow when we're eating out, but we'll also try to tackle some of the less obvious ways to make a restaurant meal healthy. To help out I talked with nutritionists and registered dietitians Allanah DiBona and Andy Bellatti. </p>
<p> With that, let's get the common sense rules out of the way. </p>
<p> The Common Sense Rules You Probably Already Know </p>
<p> Just because eating healthy should be common sense doesn't mean we actually abide by it. In fact, most of us probably throw our common sense out the window the second we plop down with a menu filled with spectacularly described food. Here are a few reminders for the simple ways you can keep a restaurant meal healthy. </p>
<p> Don't leave portion control up to your willpower: We are all pretty terrible at self control, and when you see a plate of tasty food in front of you, it's easy to keep eating until you can't eat anymore. According to Andy Bellatti, your best option is to order half portions whenever possible. Allanah DiBona adds that you might try considering an appetizer as a meal. </p>
<p> Order dressing and sauces on the side: A restaurant can make something as healthy as a salad unhealthy by covering it in dressing. For dressing or other dippable sauces order it on the side so you can regulate—and easily understand—how much you're using. </p>
<p> The sides are often the worst part of a meal: Most sides you get at a restaurant are fried or at least covered in some type of sauce or cheese. Choose them wisely by going with the simplest option. This is often a side salad or a mixed vegetables. </p>
<p> Not all healthy food is healthy at a restaurant: Bellatti points out that a number of foods we think of as healthy aren't at certain restaurants. Sushi, for instance, is often supersized to twice the normal proportion and filled with mayo or fried fish. </p>
<p> Seriously, skip the soda: We're all aware soda isn't healthy, but it's worth repeating just to make sure we're all on the same page. If you're in need of caffeine see our tasty and healthy alternatives to soda. </p>

<p> The simple rule for eating out is: If it sounds like it's unhealthy, it probably is. With that in mind, let's move on to some of the ways you can customize almost any meal to make it healthier. Photo by Alpha. </p>
<p> Eat Healthy at Any Sit-Down Restaurant </p>
<p> You can certainly try to hit up healthy restaurants but you aren't always in full control of the restaurant choice. Perhaps you're on vacation with a large group of friends and you're roped into heading down to the Super Fatty Butter Palace for a meal. You can still make healthy choices and here's how to do it. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Give Your Willpower a Break and Eat a Snack First </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> It might seem counterintuitive, but one of the best things you can do for yourself before eating out is to eat a little snack before you go. Bellatti explains: </p>
<p> Eating something an hour before you get to the restaurant is one of the best ways to avoid cravings and impulse decisions. Some ideas: half an apple and a tablespoon of peanut butter, vegetables and hummus, a small banana and a square of dark chocolate. The idea is not to get to the restaurant already full, but to avoid that famished feeling that leads to "eating with the eyeballs." </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Essentially, eating a snack gives your willpower a rest and makes a healthy decision easy. When you're not starving those two appetizers followed by a burger the size of your head won't be nearly as appealing. Photo by jrsnchzhrs. </p>
<p> Navigate Any Menu Like a Nutrition Pro </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Finding a healthy meal on a menu is hard at a lot restaurants, but all you need to know is where to start. DiBona offers a pretty simple tip for this: </p>
<p> A good rule of thumb is to make protein and produce the basis of your meals. It's easier to navigate a menu when you're looking for large servings of protein (chicken, fish, beef) and any sort of produce that appeals (salad, veggie sides, etc.). If you're aiming for health, most people find these parameters the easiest way to operate. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Once you've made your protein choice start looking for the simplest sounding food on the menu. Bellatti explains: </p>
<p> The idea is to eat simple food. Anything smothered in five types of cheese is not "simple." An edamame appetizer? Simple. Nachos with sour cream, beef, and cheese? Overload. Corn tortillas with black beans and sauteed vegetables? Simple. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> With these choices you can usually find something on the menu that's both appetizing and healthy. If you're still stuck then it's time to start asking your waiter questions. Photo by Orin Zebest. </p>
<p> The Questions You Should Ask </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> If you're anything like me then you probably have no interest in asking questions about menu items and instead order blindly without worry for the repercussions. This is great for an adventurous night out, but if you want to keep the meal healthy you have to ask questions. DiBona offers this reasoning: </p>
<p> Shelve your pride and ask some questions. Often we avoid seeking information in restaurants in order to avoid being the high maintenance table. Servers memorize the menus for a reason, and you're purchasing a product. [Asking a question] ensures you're getting something you really want. You should always know precisely what you're putting into your body. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Bellatti echoes those statements but adds a few concrete questions that are good to ask in nearly every circumstance: </p>
<p> What can I get instead of fries? </p>
<p> What vegetables can I get with that? </p>
<p> Do you offer half portions? </p>
<p> Asking questions will only get you so far. At some restaurants you might also need to make substitutions. Photo by Jeffrey Beall. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Tweak the Menu with Substitutions and Requests </p>
<p> Even with knowledge of a menu you still might not find a super healthy option. When that's the case it's time to make substitutions and requests. This is surprisingly easy and only requires a few tweaks: </p>
<p> Hold the butter: Restaurants often use more butter in your single meal than you probably do at home in an entire week. Asking them to hold off on it will cut the fat content. </p>
<p> Skip the extras: Cheeses, bacon, or mayonnaise are all pretty enticing when you're ordering but most restaurants pack on more than a single serving which can add unneeded fat to your otherwise healthy meal. </p>
<p> Find the best dips: Bellatti recommends sticking with dips like guacamole or hummus when you have the option. If you're not into stuffing up on bread he suggests asking for cucumbers in place of pita bread for dipping. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Bellatti adds that some menu change substitutions are pretty useless and you're best bet is to concentrate on cooking methods: </p>
<p> You're better off getting items that are cooked healthfully (i.e.: grilled, broiled, etc) and then substituting healthier sides than trying to get someone in the kitchen to use 1 teaspoon of oil to cook your dish instead of 2 tablespoons. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For the most part you can apply the same rules above to fast food joints, but fast food is more about research (which is easier because they're all chains) than anything else. </p>
<p> Find the Best Options for Fast Food </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Since fast food isn't made to order (at least not entirely) it's not always easy to ask for substitutions or different cooking ingredients. Instead, you have to know what your best options are and what to avoid. </p>
<p> Picking what food to order is as simple as knowing the facts. A Calorie Counter's breakdown of the best and worst menu items at fast food joints is the easiest place to start. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> One of the key tricks with any fast food restaurant is to avoid the sides and just order an entree. Most of the extra calories in typical fast food come from the nearly unlimited soda refills and the default order of fries. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> For everything else you can heed the same advice as a sit-down restaurant: skip the extra sauces, look for healthily cooked foods, keep your order simple (for instance, a Bacon Sundae is not simple), and if your food is prepared right in front of you ask for lighter portions (restaurants like Chipotle, for example, pack on way too much rice for a normal human).

<p> Don't Beat Yourself Up for the Occasional Indulgence </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Whether you're eating out once a week or you're on vacation and doing it every day the key point both Andy Bellatti and Allanah DiBona stress is that you shouldn't always beat yourself up for overindulging. </p>
<p> One way DiBona suggests dealing with this is by applying the 80-20 rule. Focus your choices on nutrition 80 percent of the time and use the other 20 percent as wiggle room when you just need to indulge. She also suggests the best way to deal with shame is to walk it off by taking a stroll around the neighborhood after your meal. If nothing else, just let go a little when you're eating out. Bellatti sums it up nicely: </p>
<p> They should stop turning every meal into a guilt-fest. Nothing is more irritating than a dinner companion who has to make some negative comment after every bite ("Ugh, there goes my diet!" after taking two bites of bread or "I shouldn't have eaten that!" after having a few bites of dessert). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> You can find healthy options on nearly every menu if you know what to look for. This is key when you're on an extended vacation or if you eat out for a lot of your meals. For everyone else the real takeaway is to let yourself relax a little: find the good options on the menu but don't worry about any indulgences you might make. Just try not to eat yourself into a food coma. Photo by Alpha. </p>

<p> If you're with someone who doesn't have a lot of self control either, try ordering for each other. Those that love us often less optimistic than we are about our ability to control ourselves when we're hungry. </p>
<p> I know that, if fries are on his plate, my SO will eat them, and regret it. He knows that if there's anything sweet on my plate, I won't be able to just eat a 'taste' and leave the rest be. We also know that the other person often can't resist ordering the forbidden things, since we've convinced ourselves that we just one a little bit. </p>

<p> What to Do If You Eat Something You're Allergic To </p>
<p> IMPORTANT: If you've actually eaten something you're allergic to, consult a medical professional immediately. If your allergic reaction could be severe, call 911. </p>
<p> Having an allergic reaction is no fun. At the very least, an allergic reaction can lead to uncomfortable itching, swelling, and hours spent bent over in a bathroom—and we don't have to tell you that at its worst, an allergic reaction can be fatal. That's just one very good reason most of people are allergy tested as infants—it's not a surprise you want as an adult. </p>
<p> The most common food allergens are to peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat, soy, fish, and shellfish, says Brigitte Zeitlin, M.P.H., R.D., C.D.N. And while those may be easy to avoid in our own kitchens, eating at a restaurant—or even at a friend's house—can have dangerous consequences if we're not fully aware of what's on or in the menu. It's also possible to develop new allergies as we age, leading us to eat a dangerous food we thought was safe. </p>
<p> If you're experiencing nasal congestion, an itchy throat, skin redness or swelling, eczema, hives, nausea, cramping or discomfort after eating something—up to six hours after eating, in fact—Zeitlin says it's likely you're having an allergic reaction. Here's what to do next. </p>
<p> 1. Stop eating when allergy symptoms start. </p>
<p> If a nefarious peanut makes its way into your supposedly peanut-less pad Thai, stop eating those noodles stat, Zeitlin instructs, and start paying attention to your symptoms. Itchy, scratchy throat, redness, and even slight swelling can be cured with an antihistamine, such as Benadryl or Zyrtec. But if your symptoms worsen—think: you can't breathe—skip immediately to step number five. </p>
<p> 2. Get to the bathroom. </p>
<p> As if the itching and swelling weren't bad enough, an allergic reaction often also comes with another unpleasant consequence: diarrhea. If you begin to experience cramps, Zeitlin says you should head to the nearest bathroom or, if you can make it, to your home. After all, you might be in the bathroom a while—it just depends how much of the food you ate. Contrary to common sense, Zeitlin recommends that you don't take an anti-diarrhea medication. "It's in your body's best interest to get it all out," unpleasant as that may be, she says. </p>
<p> 3. Keep yourself hydrated. </p>
<p> "While your body is purging the allergen food from it is system, the best thing you can do is drink plenty of fluids," Zeitlin says. Water is always a good idea, but you can also sip on low calorie sports drinks to replenish the electrolytes you're likely losing, Zeitlin says. "We lose a lot of hydration from diarrhea and vomiting and can become fatigued," she explains, "so drinking beverages with electrolytes helps keep our bodies healthy while rid the allergy." </p>
<p> 4. Eat foods that will help you recover. </p>
<p> Once you are ready to eat again, you should choose foods that will promote gut healing and reduce inflammation, Zeitlin says. Luckily, that's a long, yummy list: Greek yogurt sprinkled with chia seeds, avocado, almonds—if you're not allergic to them—brown rice, whole grain bread, berries, apples, bananas, or green tea with a pinch of cinnamon, will all do the trick. </p>
<p> 5. Get to the hospital if it's serious. </p>
<p> If you have a severe allergic reaction—see step number one for symptoms—then grab your EpiPen and get yourself to the nearest hospital or urgent care center, Zeitlin advises. You'll need to "tell the nurse about your allergy and how you were contaminated," she says, to get the most effective treatment. If you don't know, you can work with the doctor to determine whether you've developed a new allergy and whether you require additional medical tests. </p>

<p> Here’s What Actually Happens If You Eat Moldy Food, According To Doctors </p>
<p> Few things are as horror-inducing as biting into a piece of fruit and noticing a patch of colorful, fuzzy mold. (Insert internal screams here.) </p>
<p> It feels like a betrayal—and suddenly you're spitting out that chunk of your precious apple or holding your moldy slice of bread over the garbage can, contemplating calling your mom for her to reassure you that nothing too terrible happens if you eat mold. </p>
<p> Whether you’re tempted to rinse out your mouth with Listerine for a good 10 minutes or just cut around the mold and keep chomping away, know this: Eating moldy food probably won't do you too much harm, let alone kill you, according to Rudolph Bedford, MD, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica. </p>
<p> Actually, sad and grossed out as you may be about eating (or almost eating) that blue fuzz, you'll probably be fine, he says. </p>
<p> However, there are a few things you should keep in mind when it comes to dealing with (and, gulp, ingesting) moldy food—especially considering that, on rare occasions, it can actually make you sick. </p>
<p> Before you brazenly continue noshing on your fruit or popping that toast in the toaster, here's the low-down on everything that can happen if you eat mold. </p>
<p> Give it to me straight. What happens if I eat mold? </p>
<p> Don't run to the bathroom to scrub your tongue with a bar of soap just yet. “You’re not going to die from eating mold,” says Dr. Bedford. In fact, as long as your immune system is in good shape, you can digest it like any other food. </p>
<p> This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site. </p>
<p> Though molds (a.k.a. microscopic fungi)—which creep up on plant and animal products after being transported there by air, water, or insects—can be dangerous, they usually aren’t, according to the USDA. </p>
<p> After all, molds are actually meant to be on certain foods—including dry-cured country hams and cheeses such as blue cheese, Gorgonzola, Brie, and Camembert. In many of these cases, mold is totally safe to eat, the USDA says. </p>
<p> But what about the fuzzy green or white stuff that pops up unannounced on fruits, vegetables, bread, and dairy products? </p>
<p> You might feel sick after accidentally eating these molds, but that's most likely because the mold tastes bad, not because of any particular toxin in it, says Dr. Bedford. </p>
<p> Even then, he recommends waiting to see if your symptoms escalate beyond nausea before rushing to call the doctor. “The stomach is a harsh environment, so, for the most part, most bacteria and fungus won't survive,” he explains. </p>
<p> But what if I do get super sick from eating moldy food? </p>
<p> “It’s very uncommon that you’re going to get [really] sick from mold,” says Dr. Bedford. And in the rare instance that you do, you'll likely have had to consume large amounts of the stuff. (And, c'mon, are you really going to keep licking the fuzz off your food? I didn't think so.) </p>
<p> If the unlikely occurs, though, and your symptoms include persistent nausea and vomiting, you should definitely call the doctor, Dr. Bedford says. Typically, he'd just prescribe anti-nausea medication—but if you're really feeling miserable, he might prescribe something to induce vomiting or diarrhea to try to flush out your system. </p>
<p> In some cases, people have allergic reactions to certain molds, which can contribute to respiratory issues, says Dr. Bedford. But don't worry, they're usually temporary and easily treated by your doctor. </p>
<p> Ultimately, though, don't get too freaked out: In his 30 years of practice, Dr. Bedford says he has never seen anyone die or require more intense treatment due to mold (though that doesn't mean it's impossible). </p>
<p> Just take mold as a sign that your food’s gone bad and move on. </p>
<p> Wait, can't I just cut the mold off of my food? </p>
<p> If you're not too skeeved out by that patch of mold on your eats, you might be tempted to just cut it off and continue eating, but whether or not this is actually a good idea depends on the food. </p>
<p> Though we only see their fuzzy discolored tops, all molds have “roots” that invade foods, according to the USDA. Since these roots allow toxins (if there are any) to spread throughout the inside of your food, your best move is to throw out the moldy food in its entirety, regardless of where you see the moldy patch, Dr. Bedford says. </p>
<p> Still, mold can't penetrate certain hard cheeses, hard salami, firm fruits, and vegetables as easily as softer foods, the USDA says. That makes these foods easier to save from a fuzzy patch. Just make sure to cut off at least an inch around and below the moldy spot, keep your knife out of the mold, and wrap the “good” part of the food in a new covering. </p>
<p> For quick reference, these food are generally okay to eat once you cut off any mold: </p>
<p> Hard cheeses </p>
<p> Hard salami </p>
<p> Firm fruits </p>
<p> Vegetables </p>
<p> These foods, meanwhile, should be thrown away if at all moldy: </p>
<p> Also, FYI, toasting your bread will not kill the mold on it, so don't even go there. Since bread is super porous, it's definitely one to chuck at the first sign of fuzz, says the USDA. </p>
<p> How can I prevent mold from forming in the first place? </p>
<p> Since warm, humid conditions encourage mold growth—and dry mold spores float through the air in search of new places in which to grow some more moldy friends—the USDA recommends a few best practices for keeping mold from messing with your food: </p>
<p> Examine foods for mold before buying them </p>
<p> Purchase food in small amounts so mold doesn't have time to grow </p>
<p> Stash food in the refrigerator quickly </p>
<p> Eat leftovers within three or four days </p>
<p> Clean your refrigerator regularly </p>
<p> Of course, molds can still grow in the refrigerator (albeit much more slowly), but following these guidelines can help keep your eats fresh and fuzz-free for as long as possible. </p>
<p> The bottom line: Eating moldy food probably won't make you sick, but most foods should be thrown away at the first sign of fuzz. To prevent mold growth, properly wrap all food and store it in a clean, dry refrigerator. </p>

<p> What to Eat Before and After Your COVID-19 Vaccine </p>
<p> Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, LDN, CLEC, CPT, has studied nutrition for almost two decades. She was named an emerging leader in women's health by the National Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. </p>
<p> Nick Blackmer is a fact checker and researcher with extensive background in health content. </p>
<p> Now that every person in the U.S. 16 and over is eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, you may be gearing up for your first or second appointment. You've likely heard of the vaccines' potential side effects, especially after the second shot of a two-dose regimen. </p>
<p> Even though there are no sure-fire ways to prevent feeling tired or nauseated post-injection, there are some dietary tips you can follow that may help you feel a bit better during the process. </p>
<p> Here are five steps you can take before and after your vaccine appointment to help prepare your body and keep you feeling your best. </p>
<p> Do Not Get Your Vaccine on an Empty Stomach </p>
<p> Having something nutritious in your system pre-injection can help the entire process feel a bit more bearable. While eating before your appointment does not appear to have any effect on the vaccine’s effectiveness, it could help prevent you from fainting or feeling dizzy—especially if you don’t typically do well with needles. </p>
<p> Considering people are required to wait at least 10 to 15 minutes post-vaccine to monitor for any potential allergic reactions to the injection, eating something beforehand can help you feel your best during the entire process. Most facilities won't allow you to eat snacks in the waiting area. </p>
<p> Choose food combinations that include unrefined carbohydrates, healthy fats, and protein to give your meal some staying power. Something as little as a piece of fruit with nut butter can be a perfect pick-me-up before your appointment. </p>
<p> Stay Hydrated </p>
<p> Headaches are a common side-effect of the vaccine, and being dehydrated can exacerbate that pain. </p>
<p> Stay ahead of the sour feeling by drinking lots of fluids. Stick with water, 100% fruit juice, teas, or other options that aren’t too sugary. Keeping a water bottle by your side throughout the day can help stay on top of your hydration the day of your appointment. </p>
<p> Skip the Alcohol </p>
<p> Drinking alcohol before you get the vaccine is not advised. And although having a cocktail or two after your shot does not appear to make your shot less effective, overdoing it can make you feel physically worse. </p>
<p> Compound that with the side effects many experience after getting vaccinated—lethargy, headache—and it makes the perfect recipe for not feeling great. It might also make it difficult to distinguish what is a side effect of the vaccine from what is a side effect of too much alcohol. </p>
<p> Plus, alcohol can cause an inflammatory response in the body, which you should try to steer clear from when trying to support your overall health and immune system. </p>
<p> Focus on Anti-Inflammatory Foods </p>
<p> After you get your vaccine, you want to support your immune system. Focusing on anti-inflammatory foods that are not heavily processed or refined may help your body stay healthy. </p>
<p> In a 2020 article published in the British Journal of Nutrition, results show that eating an anti-inflammatory diet can help reduce the risk of COVID-19.﻿﻿ And since the ultimate goal is to keep your body COVID-free, continuing to follow an anti-inflammatory diet will serve you well. </p>
<p> Focus on healthy fats and less-processed foods to reap the most benefits from your diet. Avocados, salmon, nuts, and vegetables are all great choices with anti-inflammatory effects. </p>
<p> Keep Anti-Nausea Items on Hand </p>
<p> While some people will feel just fine after receiving their vaccine, some may feel nauseated afterward. Keeping items that may help combat nausea on hand can be helpful in case it kicks in. </p>

<p> It seems that everytime i eat food it always comes back up... not all of it but sum of it... at first i thought maybe i was eating to much but i wasnt so i dont know why i do this... Its seems like ever meal it just wants to come back up and its been like this for a very long time at first i thought it happens to everyone but then i started to ask and found out it doesnt..... what do u think it is? and if you know any kind of medicine that would help me? </p>

<p> I have this same problem, and have had it for a couple of years. my issue is - when I eat the food will come back up for hours after I have eaten it, and recently I noticed when I drink a frappe it'll come back up - and still be cold. I'm not sure what it is, or what could be causing it. I don't have any pain involved with this issue. It could be from eating too much, or eating too fast... but I don't know as to why it would come back up hours after I eat. </p>
<p> I Have The EXACT same problem. My mother got an Upper GI and they found nothing wrong. but it's starting to happen more and more often. Its bothering me...when I get too full though it does help my stomach feel better. </p>
<p> try looking into gallbladder disorders that can often go udiagnosed or misdiagnosed. don't settle for an ultrasound or hida scan but rather find someone who listens to you and understands your symptoms! </p>
<p> I get the same thing, I put it down to a side effect of years of on and off bulimia, it happens no matter what or how much I eat. Not painful, just very disconcerting, it is even worse if I move around, taking the dog for a walk can be very uncomfortable. food usually taste same as when I ate it, not acidic at all. </p>

<p> I do not have Bulimia, but what your describing is exactly what happens to me. My doctor put me on Prolosec, but that has not helped. I know this sounds gross, but it tastes the same going down the first time and the 2nd time. It definately happens with ice-cream, but has also happened with other foods. I am going back to the doctor Next week. I will let you know what she said. </p>
<p> Has this gotten any better for you? i have the same thing. I am going to the doctor next week to see if they can come up with anything. </p>

<p> I have the same issue and I think I was born with it since I can't recall when it started. I am now 32 yrs of age and have made peace with it, at some point I thought I was the only one with this until I came across this topic. </p>
<p> I have a similar problem. I have been told that the muscle at the bottom of the esophagus is not closing let food back up. I take Prilosec for acid reflux and it helps. Some food do not come up and I think with self control I can keep it from happening. There is an operation where they put a clap at the bottom of the Esophagus that is being performed I am told. If you do this however you can not vomit. I am just living with it </p>

<p> I have the same problem. My doctor has put me on an acid reducer medicine but it is not helping. I just read an article about Rumination Syndrome...talks about the food coming back up and tastes the same as when it went down. Never heard of this before but it sounds just like what I have. It said that there are breathing techniques that will help. Google it and see. </p>

<p> i have same issue can u please help me out </p>

<p> I think it may be caused by low stomach acid. You don't have enough stomach acid in your stomach to digest the food, it just sits there fermenting, and the excess gas creates pressur in your stomach that pushes it back up. Read Norm Robillard's research. </p>
<p> I have the same thing I don't throw up but I feel I come up and I feel like I'm about to throw up I don't know what's wrong </p>

<p> Why Don’t You Feel Hungry After Not Eating For a Long Time? </p>
<p> September 18, 2019 </p>
<p> You don’t eat for a while, and you realize you have a loss of appetite. Maybe you had to skip lunch at work, but instead of feeling famished at 5pm, you find you have no appetite and could go even longer without eating. Find out what causes loss of appetite, what hunger symptoms to look out for and more. </p>
<p> What Causes Loss of Appetite? </p>
<p> Stress </p>
<p> Adrenaline serves several purposes in the human body. The one most know about is the “fight or flight” response. When you get stressed, your body reacts as if it’s in danger, which as a result, causes your brain to release chemicals, including adrenaline, which makes your heart beat faster and slow your digestion. This in turn can curb your appetite, but typically only lasts for a short period of time. If you’re stressed over a longer period of time, your body releases cortisol, which makes you hungrier, especially for high-calorie foods. </p>
<p> Cold or Flu </p>
<p> When you aren’t feeling well, your immune system gets put into overdrive, releasing chemicals called cytokines that can make you feel tired and not hungry. Your body is telling you that you need to simply rest so that you can restore your energy levels to fight whatever is making you ill. </p>
<p> Medication </p>
<p> There are many medications on the market today that contain the side effect of appetite loss. This is common when medications pass through a person’s stomach and digestive tract. </p>
<p> The most common medications and treatments often cause a low appetite: </p>
<p> Drugs that treat high blood pressure </p>
<p> An additional cause for a loss of appetite is that you actually are hungry, you just do not realize it. You most likely are not hungry in your stomach. But have you ever felt tired, grumpy, cranky, scatterbrained, lightheaded or irritable and notice these problems improve as soon as you eat? </p>
<p> In this case, your body is telling you that it needs food– just for whatever reason, the signal is not coming through your stomach. Instead of waiting for hunger pangs, start paying close attention to your overall mood. Are you quick to snap at someone? Are you finding it hard to concentrate at work? It may just be that it’s been a little too long since your last meal. </p>
<p> As you age, your digestion slows down, leading you to have a full stomach for longer periods of time. </p>
<p> Your sense of smell, taste and vision gets weaker, making food less appealing. </p>
<p> Hormonal changes or chronic illness can curb your appetite. </p>
<p> Increased or decreased use of medications can contribute to a decreased appetite. </p>
<p> Stomach Disorders </p>
<p> If you’ve recently noticed diarrhea, nausea, stomach pains or bloating after eating a meal, you may experience a loss of appetite. This is often associated with stomach disorders. </p>
<p> Adrenaline and The Process of Lipolysis </p>
<p> What adrenaline does is drive a process called lipolysis. This is the process your body undertakes when it wants to break down your fat reserves to give itself some energy. Lipolysis also prevents you from burning through your muscle when you don’t eat for a while. </p>
<p> Lipolysis likely occurs as an evolutionary function. Early humans did not have what we have today. There was no intense agriculture. People didn’t have easy access to food. Instead, we were hunter/gatherers, which means there would be periods where earlier humans just couldn’t access food. </p>
<p> That’s where lipolysis probably started kicking in for those early humans. Their bodies would burn through their fat reserves so that they could keep going during long periods. The elimination of hunger pangs that comes from this would distract from the issue and ensure the humans could focus on getting food rather than how much he or she needed food. </p>
<p> This is something most of us don’t experience today. You probably have access to food even if you don’t eat for a while. Even so, not eating triggers the same sort of response and your body goes into a sort of survival mode if it does not receive food over a long period of time. Adrenaline plays a key role in keeping that going until you eventually decide to eat. </p>
<p> The Blood Glucose Issue </p>
<p> It’s not just your fat reserves you need to think about. Not eating means your body doesn’t get the sugars it needs to operate properly. This leads to a process called gluconeogenesis, which also causes the loss of appetite. </p>
<p> Gluconeogenesis is your body’s way of telling itself that blood glucose levels are too low. </p>
<p> When you undergo gluconeogenesis, your body starts producing more of a hormone called glucagon. </p>
<p> Glucagon increases blood glucose levels while also dropping insulin production. </p>
<p> Gluconeogenesis causes your body to start breaking down fats and tissues, kind of like how adrenaline does. </p>
<p> Eventually, the body runs out of these energy sources and fasting mode then becomes the more serious starvation mode. </p>
<p> At this point, your metabolism begins to slow down and your body will burn muscle tissue for energy. </p>
<p> However, true starvation mode is not entered until 3 days straight of not eating. </p>
<p> After 3 days, your body will start breaking down vital tissues and organs as it enters a deeper survival mode. </p>
<p> Your body will not reach this point if you have only skipped 1 meal or have only gone 24 hours without eating. </p>
<p> The result of not eating for more than 24 hours straight while undergoing gluconeogenesis will simply be that your body will break down the fatty acid reserves of fat in the body and around the organs and turn them into fuel. </p>
<p> So, think of it this way – if you haven’t eaten anything in a while, you may experience hunger pangs. What is your body telling you? Probably to go find food. Our bodies encourage us to do that by flooding our tubes with adrenaline and triggers the release of glucose from energy stores, which makes our mind sharper and increases our basal metabolic rate. </p>
<p> The body is a powerful thing. It will take measures to halt further muscle loss because of its crucial role in keeping us strong and functional. Therefore, your body will not enter “starvation mode” until after about 3 days (72 hours) of not eating. </p>
<p> For many healthy adults, it’s not the worst thing in the world to occasionally skip a meal. But if you frequently reach the point where your hunger dissipates, here are some ways to increase your appetite in the long run. </p>
<p> How to Increase Appetite </p>
<p> Change your eating habits (Ex. If you’re used to skipping breakfast, consider starting the day off with a nourishing meal). </p>
<p> Eat nutrient-rich foods. </p>
<p> Stock up on your favorite foods – you’ll find it’s much easier to eat something you really enjoy. </p>
<p> Eat several, smaller portioned meals instead of a few large meals. </p>
<p> Drink water between meals, not during. </p>
<p> Exercise – physical activity releases brain chemicals that can improve your mood and stimulate your appetite. </p>
<p> Use carminative herbs and spices, such as peppermint, fennel, rosemary or parsley to help reduce bloating and improve your appetite. </p>
<p> Should I Eat Even If I’m Not Hungry? </p>
<p> Should you eat when you’re not hungry? Or better yet, when you’re not feeling hungry but know your body needs food, what should you do? </p>
<p> The right thing to do is to always eat when there is physiological/internal cue – in other words, when you either feel that hunger pang or become aware that your body is in need of a nourishing substance. </p>
<p> There are 2 guiding factors of what to eat and how much. </p>
<p> Inner Wisdom </p>
<p> Subjective </p>
<p> How the body lets us know that we need food, or have had enough to eat. </p>
<p> Outer Wisdom </p>
<p> Objective </p>
<p> Knowing what your body needs even if it’s not exactly asking for it. </p>
<p> While it may be easier to identify hunger using inner wisdom, we cannot discount our outer wisdom. Outer wisdom is the knowledge to know that it’s been a little while since we last had something to eat and that our body needs food – even if it’s not showing any signs or hunger symptoms. </p>
<p> What To Eat When You’re Not Hungry? </p>
<p> After considering all the loss of appetite causes, you might decide that your lack of appetite is really nothing to worry about. You feel strong, you’re in a good mood and you’ve ruled out major causes like chronic disease. In that case, this feeling is completely normal. </p>
<p> However, a lack of appetite is not necessarily a sign that your body has enough food and doesn’t need more. It’s important to still eat even when you don’t feel hungry to make sure you are getting in the required nutrients to become the strongest you there is. For example, pregnant women would still need to eat in order to obtain those nutrients needed to support their body and their baby. </p>
<p> So, what to do? </p>
<p> Choose calorie-dense foods, such as avocados and fatty meats. This way, you don’t have to scarf down a huge quantity of food when you don’t feel hungry. </p>
<p> Consider making a fruit/vegetable smoothie that is high in vitamins, minerals and many other beneficial nutrients. </p>
<p> Chug a glass of water to stay hydrated and refreshed. </p>
<p> When you’re low on energy from either dieting or fasting and your glucose is low, consider an energy source packed with vitamins, such as Neuro’s gums and mints, to provide your body with needed vitamins like B6 and B12. </p>

<p> Why You Need to Eat Fat With Your Cannabis </p>
<p> byjeanmckinney•July 18, 2018•5 minutes </p>
<p> Cannabis cooks know that fats like butter and coconut oil are essential ingredients for giving edibles their potency. That’s because cannabinoids like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are fat-soluble. This means that you need to eat marijuana edibles with fats to make the cannabinoids available to the body. </p>
<p> But recent research reveals that the connection between fats and cannabis is more complex than that, with important implications for making the most of marijuana’s many medicinal properties. </p>
<p> Cannabis Compounds Are Lipophiles—Why Is This Important? </p>
<p> Chemicals that people consume such as vitamins, supplements and medications are either water soluble or fat soluble. This means that they can dissolve and become bioavailable either by water or fat. Water-soluble substances such as vitamin C and B-complex vitamins dissolve easily in water, so that excess amounts of these chemicals are washed out through the kidneys. </p>
<p> But fat-soluble substances like vitamins A and K are lipophiles, or fat lovers. This means that they depend on fats in order to become available to the body. Instead of being flushed out through the kidneys, these substances accumulate over time in the body’s fatty tissues. This is why it can be easy to reach potentially toxic levels of these kinds of chemicals if a person consumes too much of them. </p>
<p> Cannabis researchers have identified more than 60 compounds in the cannabis sativa plant. Most of them appear to be inactive and don’t have a particular effect on humans. But euphoria-inducing THC and immune-boosting, inflammation-fighting CBD top the list of active cannabinoids that mimic the effects of the body’s own endocannabinoid system (ECS). </p>
<p> When you smoke or vape cannabis, these cannabinoid molecules can directly enter the capillaries in the lungs and quickly move from there into the bloodstream. Then they circulate to the brain and other parts of the body. But eating cannabis won’t produce the same result. It’s simply broken down by the digestive system and passed on out of the body. </p>
<p> This is because cannabis compounds are all lipophiles. They need fats to dissolve and become bioavailable. They also accumulate in the body’s own fatty tissues. So, to be most effective, cannabis needs to be accompanied by dietary fats of some kind—and the fattier the better. </p>
<p> Fats Trigger the Intestinal Lymphatic System </p>
<p> The lymphatic system is a widespread network that supports immune functioning and helps the body eliminate toxins and waste. Hundreds of lymph nodes are found throughout the body, and most people are familiar with them as glands in the armpit, groin or neck that swell up in response to an infection. </p>
<p> But the body also has a lymphatic system in the digestive tract. And recent research has found that this intestinal lymphatic system plays an important role in making the compounds in cannabis edibles accessible to the body. </p>
<p> When a person eats a cannabis edible that contains a high-fat ingredient or has a relatively high- fat meal along with eating a marijuana edible, these fats appear to stimulate activity in the intestinal lymphatic system. In this way, the compounds that are dissolved in fats are transported into the bloodstream by this secondary lymphatic system and made available to the body. </p>
<p> Not All Fats Are Equally as Good at Making Marijuana Bioavailable </p>
<p> Many people who make cannabis edibles or extracts at home say that butter is a favorite carrier for delivering the full benefits of THC and/or CBD. This is because butter is a saturated fat. Saturated fats, which are mainly found in animal products, are high in long-chain fatty acids and are the most effective medium for dissolving cannabis compounds. </p>
<p> Plant-based fats—such as olive oil, sesame oil or avocado oil—are unsaturated. Although they can make cannabis compounds bioavailable too, they may not deliver the full effect as efficiently as saturated animal fats do. </p>
<p> One significant exception is coconut oil. In recent years, the coconut has taken the natural health world by storm for its ability to deliver the health benefits of saturated fat without the damaging effects that saturated fats can have on the heart and cardiovascular system. And now, cannabis edible enthusiasts are embracing coconut oil as perhaps the ideal carrier for edible cannabis compounds. </p>
<p> Coconut oil is around 90% saturated fat. But because it’s plant based, that fat derives from medium-chain fatty acids that don’t typically cause the hardening of the arteries and cholesterol clogging action that saturated animal fats can. </p>
<p> You don’t have to consume a lot of fat in an edible itself to get the benefits of cannabinoids. New studies reveal that eating a high-fat meal along with your cannabis edible can achieve similar results. </p>
<p> Cannabis Builds Up in Fatty Tissues </p>
<p> Cannabis has an affinity for fat in other ways, too. Because excess amounts of fat-soluble chemicals and compounds aren’t flushed from the body the way water soluble ones are, cannabis compounds can be stored in the body’s fat cells for 30 days or more. </p>
<p> Over this period of time, these compounds are gradually released back into the bloodstream and eventually eliminated. But in the meantime, they’re still detectable in the body. This is why it’s possible to test positive for THC well after the last time you consumed it. It’s also why some athletes who work out hard claim to get high from the THC that’s released when they’re burning body fat, well after they actually consumed marijuana. </p>
<p> It’s true that THC levels can test higher after a workout, because of what’s stored in fatty tissue. But is it enough for you to feel high, too? The jury’s still out on that one. </p>
<p> The complex ways in which cannabis and fat interact can have serious implications for the medical uses of cannabis. If you’re taking your cannabis in edible forms, whether—and how— you consume them with fat has a major impact on whether you’re getting the optimal dose of the cannabis compounds you need. </p>
<p> But cannabis compounds love fat. And combining them with the right kinds of fat can make the health benefits of cannabis edibles even more potent. </p>
