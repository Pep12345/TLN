<p> 10 Inspiring Startup Books For You To Read </p>

<p> Let’s go through 10 of the very best startup books for founders to read. Each of the books included in this list covers a unique perspective on building a better startup. They can help you gather important feedback, iterate and improve your idea, and turn it into a sustainable business. </p>
<p> So, let’s jump directly into the list. </p>
<p> Best Startup Books </p>
<p> Beginning with book number one, “The Lean Startup” by Eric Ries. This is a must-read book for anybody building a startup because it really focuses on the importance of identifying and clarifying the underlying assumptions of your startup really early in the process. And two that it focuses on primarily are the value assumption and the growth assumption. </p>
<p> So with the value assumption, there’s going to be some underlying belief that customers will value and appreciate what it is that you’re aiming to create. And number two, there’s going to be some assumption about how you plan to attract customers to the business in a profitable way. </p>
<p> And so this book really focuses on getting clear about what those assumptions are and finding inexpensive ways to test and validate them really early on before you spend a lot of time, energy, or money building out the business processes around that core idea. </p>
<p> Next on the list is “Sprint” by Jake Knapp. This book covers Google ventures unique five-day process for answering critical questions really early on in the product development process. And in many ways, it picks up where “The Lean Startup” left off because that book really focuses on why you want to conduct things like an MVP or a prototype to make sure that you’re validating your idea really early on. </p>
<p> But this book provides a lot of frameworks, tactics, tools, and systems for how to go about doing that more effectively. So even though “The Lean Startup” does cover some of that, I would say this book is a very strong compliment because it goes into much, much more detail about exactly how to build a prototype for whatever your idea is and gather important feedback to make sure that you’re moving in the right direction. </p>
<p> So if you need to solve a big problem, if you need to break out of a rut, if you need to make quick progress on a very difficult challenge, then I recommend that you use the five-day sprint week format to solve those kinds of challenges. </p>
<p> Let’s continue on to “The Mom Test” by Rob Fitzpatrick. One of the fastest ways to improve your idea really early on even before you build something like a prototype or a minimum viable product is to talk with early potential customers to simply express to them what it is that you’re trying to solve and to get their feedback even before you really start to lock down what it is that you plan to build. </p>
<p> Now, one of the big issues that we face when we share our idea with early potential customers is that often what we’re really trying to do is get early validation for our idea. And all too often we can make the mistake of trying to sell the idea instead of gathering truly useful information and feedback at this very early stage. </p>
<p> And so the result of all that is that we often end up gathering false support or false encouragement because people are simply trying to be polite. So we share what it is that we’re working on, we explain it, we put our ego on the line, they pick up on the fact that we’re really hoping to get some encouragement, and so they offer up some kind of encouragement again to be socially acceptable or simply to be polite. </p>
<p> And so this book is all about how to properly talk with potential customers to get useful and honest information that you can use to iterate and improve your idea even before you build something like a prototype. It’s all about how to communicate with people to get the maximum value out of the conversation in terms of honest information that you can actually use instead of just seeking out early validation. So an absolute must-read really early on in the startup journey. </p>
<p> Let’s continue on to “Crossing The Chasm” by Geoffrey A. Moore. This book is about how to successfully market and sell disruptive products. And the reason why this is so important for startups is that a big part of this book is about explaining the different kinds of customers that you’re gonna come into contact with throughout the startup and even full-on business journey. </p>
<p> So it explains the different kinds of people you’re going to meet along the way and the different things that they value at various stages of your business. So I’ll give you two quick examples and there are others, but I’ll give you two quick examples. There are early adopters, the kinds of people that absolutely love to try new things, and in fact, often go out of their way to try new things, new solutions, new interesting ways to solve a problem. </p>
<p> And then there are pragmatist mainstream customers, and these customers do not like to try new things. In fact, they much prefer tried and true proven solutions. And what’s very important to understand is that early adopters, while they’re typically the first kind of customer or one of the first that you’re going to encounter with a startup, they represent a relatively small portion of the overall market. </p>
<p> And if you can make your way, or you can cross the chasm over to pragmatist mainstream customers, this is a much larger group that can ultimately allow your business to become much more successful. And so it’s very important to understand the different kinds of customers that you’ll come into contact with and what it is they value, and how you can eventually move from, again, these early adopters to this much larger audience of mainstream customers so you can increase your revenues and increase your profits over time. </p>
<p> Let’s continue on to “Start At The End” by Matt Wallaert. This book is about building products that can change customer behavior. And as the title suggests, it’s all about starting at the end and getting very clear about how you want customers to use or engage with your product or your service. How you want it to change the world or change their behavior. </p>
<p> And then you work backward from that to design the product or service in such a way that that outcome is significantly more likely. And the book is into great detail about exactly how to do this. How to design a product so that certain outcomes are much more likely. </p>
<p> And if you can do this correctly if you apply these ideas in the right way, you can increase product usage, adoption, and engagement, and this in turn, of course, can end up causing more positive reviews, increased word of mouth referral, and even repeat purchases in the future because customers are getting significantly more value out of whatever it is that you’ve created. </p>
<p> Let’s continue on to “Marketing Made Simple” by Donald Miller. At the end of the day, a lot of startup success ultimately comes down to effective marketing. You need a consistent and reliable way to convert prospects into paying customers. </p>
<p> And this book is all about how to build an effective sales funnel so that you can communicate with potential customers about exactly what it is that you offer, how it can benefit them, how it can create value for them, and why they may or may not be interested in what it is that you have to offer. So this book goes into a lot of detail around the fundamental things that you need to execute to build out a simple yet effective sales funnel. </p>
<p> Some of the topics include how to build a sales website, how to create lead generators, and how to use email sequences both to nurture prospects and to close sales. So if you’re looking for a simple way to build out your basic marketing or sales funnel, this is an absolute must-read. </p>
<p> Let’s continue on to “Traction” by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares. The number one reason why new startups often fail is that they aren’t able to attract enough customers. So this book is all about how to go about attracting more customers to your startup. And it covers 19 different traction channels or marketing channels that you can use to attract customers. </p>
<p> And even more valuable than that, in my opinion, is it goes through a simple framework for how to identify which of the marketing channels are the best fit for your particular startup. So the bullseye framework covered in the book helps you brainstorm ideas, select promising channels, test those channels, and ultimately choose the best channel for you to start on, and then eventually you can revisit the process to identify additional opportunities moving forward. </p>
<p> So this book very much works hand in hand with the last one, with “Marketing Made Simple” that book’s all about how to build out your sales funnel, and a book like this can help you attract prospects and customers into that sales funnel. </p>
<p> Let’s continue on to “Contagious” by Jonah Berger. One of the most important factors, once you begin to gain a little bit of traction with your startup, is word-of-mouth referral. </p>
<p> If you can ever so slightly increase the rate at which people who are familiar with your product or service end up sharing or recommending what it is that you do with other people, that can have a profound impact on your long-term success because the more people are willing to share and recommend what it is that you do, you can save a lot when it comes to marketing and even the marketing that you do engage with in terms of paid advertising or anything like that, all of this is made much more effective because it also leads to additional word of mouth referral. </p>
<p> So this book is all about the six principles of contagiousness. Six different things that you can incorporate into your product or into your business in the way that you communicate about your product to make it more likely that people will engage in word of mouth referral and help spread what it is that you do. </p>
<p> And the book provides many, many examples of how businesses have successfully integrated each of these six ideas into different kinds of products, or services, or ideas to make them that much more contagious. </p>
<p> Let’s continue on to “Blue Ocean Strategy” by W. Chan Kim and Reneée Mauborgne. This is a very popular book about how to avoid the bloody red ocean of competition. As a startup, you wanna do everything you can to avoid direct head-to-head competition with a well-established business. </p>
<p> Now, that runs contrary to popular belief because a lot of people think that startups are all about disruption, but ideally, you wanna craft a strategy that allows you to differentiate yourself from established businesses. Eventually, you might face off with them in some way, but initially, you really wanna have a unique value proposition that is not in direct head-to-head competition with another business. </p>
<p> So this book is all about tools, frameworks, tactics, and strategies around creating a blue ocean of uncontested market space. How to avoid direct competition by creating a differentiated strategy. So at the end of the day, it’s about creating unique value for a unique audience, and making the competition largely irrelevant to your long-term success. </p>
<p> Let’s continue on to the last book on the list, “Zero To One” by Peter Thiel. This book is all about how to build a valuable business. And it kicks off with a contrarian question, what important truth do very few people agree with you on? And the idea behind this question and a lot of the other ideas in this book is to help you get very clear about your own unique beliefs about the world, or your industry, or how you see the future as being different than the present. </p>
<p> Because it’s this kind of unique thinking that allows you to create a business, or a product, or a solution that is different than what other people out there in the marketplace are providing. And so you can get very clear on how you can create unique value in the marketplace. And Peter Thiel makes the argument that a startup’s most important strength is new thinking and that its small size is what makes this possible. </p>
<p> I love Peter’s definition of a startup. He says, “A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.” He goes on to explain that a startup is very uniquely positioned to create meaningful change, because as an individual thinker, or entrepreneur, or founder, very difficult to create a meaningful impact in the world. </p>
<p> And as a large, well-established business it’s very difficult to have fresh and interesting thinking that breaks with the status quo. So a startup is very uniquely positioned to take interesting ideas and have a very real impact on the world. I found this book very inspiring, I found it very thought-provoking. </p>

<p> "I read a book," "I read books" and "I read book." </p>
<p> 1. I read a book. 2. I read books. 3. I read book. I know that sentences (1) and (2) are grammatically correct. In the third sentence, "a" was omitted. Is it also correct? </p>
<p> Re: "I read a book," "I read books" and "I read book." </p>
<p> No. 3 is wrong without the article 'a' since book is countable. You can say : I read fiction. not a teacher </p>
<p> Re: "I read a book," "I read books" and "I read book." </p>
<p> Would this mean that in the sentence "I never saw action during the war," the word action is uncountable and it's the reason why there is no an or the? And the word action in the sentences below is countable? 1. I never saw an/the action during the war. 2. I never saw actions during the war. Thanks in advance. </p>

<p> Action, like many nouns, can be used both countably and uncountably. It is probably better to think of these as characteristics, rather than part of the nature of the noun. When you're talking about fighting in wars, we tend to use it uncountably, though if the conflict consisted of a single instance the action (=all) would work. In many other contexts, we use it countably. </p>

<p> Does this mean that in the sentence "Regular verbs take the -d or -ed ending to express action in the past" the word action is uncountable since we didn't use an or the in the given sentence? Thanks in advance. </p>

<doc id="file22196628" filename="List_of_best-selling_books" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books">
<p> This page provides lists of best-selling individual books and book series to date and in any language. "Best-selling" refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources. This list is incomplete because there are many books, such as The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, and The Lord of the Rings[1] (which has been sold as both a trilogy of books, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and Return of the King, and as a single issue) by J. R. R. Tolkien, that lack comprehensive sales figures. </p>
<p> According to Guinness World Records as of 1995, the Bible is the best-selling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed.[2] Sales estimates for other printed religious texts include at least 800 million copies for the Qur'an and 190 million copies for the Book of Mormon.[3] Among non religious texts, the Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung, also known as the Little Red Book, has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures — with estimates ranging from 800 million[2] to over 6.5 billion printed volumes.[4] Some claim the distribution ran into the "billions"[5] and some cite "over a billion" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as "untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations."[6][7] Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of book may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have thus been excluded from the below lists of best-selling books for these reasons. </p>
<p> Having sold more than 500 million copies worldwide,[8][9][10] Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling is the best-selling book series in history. The first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, has sold in excess of 120 million copies,[11] making it one of the best-selling books of all time. As of June 2017, the series has been translated into 80 languages,[12] placing Harry Potter among history's most translated literary works. The last four books in the series consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books of all time, where the final installment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, sold roughly fifteen million copies worldwide within twenty-four hours of its release.[13][14] With twelve million books printed in the first US run, it also holds the record for the highest initial print run for any book in history.[15][16] </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> The Perry Rhodan series has sold more than 1 billion copies,[301] but is not listed because that figure includes magazine sales, not novels alone.[citation needed] Similarly, the Jerry Cotton series has sold over 300 million copies, but most of these were in magazine format.[302] </p>

<p> Seeing as how it is impossible to get unbiased and informed information about politics online anymore, I can totally understand why someone would want to turn to books to educate themselves. Having said that, I do have some bad news for you. Politics is such a shifting, changing thing that if you go further back than say a year or two, then the books are probably not going to help you understand what's going on as much as you might think. They can still give you some insights into the core elements, but you are almost assuredly going to encounter some outdated elements. Other people have already mentioned it too, but your geographical location is also going to determine your understanding of politics. Even countries with the same political beliefs are not going to totally agree with each other about certain things and then there are those countries who claim to belong to a certain political movement, but in reality practice something completely different. I don't want to be completely unhelpful, so these are the books that I have personally read and think can offer you some broad insights about important political topics: Fascism: A Warning by Madeleine Albright - Madeleine Albright is the first woman to ever serve as U.S. secretary of state, so she isn't just someone who studied history, but also had an active role in shaping it. She was born in Czechoslovakia just before the second World War and in her lifetime she not only had to flee from Hitler, but also from Stalin at the start of the Cold War. She lost loved ones in the Holocaust, so we are talking her about a woman who has personal experiences with the horrors that politics can cause. This is not her first book, but it deals with fascism, which is a topic I see cropping up more and more in political discussions. Albright does a great job explaining what fascism really is, how it got started and also what the warning signs are for the rise of it in our current political climate. I feel like the word is lately being used by everyone to simply describe anyone who disagrees with their political views, which is a dangerous precedent. </p>
<p> Frank Herbert never managed to complete his Dune series, but I believe that his son and another another eventually managed to do so. Whether or not the quality is the same as what Frank would have delivered is up for debate. The Wheel of Time series is another good example of someone else stepping in to complete a beloved series after the untimely death of the original author. </p>
<p> I'm not going to go into too much detail here because I'm tired and it's late, but it continually irks me how many people completely misunderstood The Prince by Machiavelli. The author was trolling people long before the word even existed and everyone still falls for it to this very day. </p>
<p> Roger Zelazny did this a lot in his books as did Anne McCaffrey with her Dragonriders series. </p>
<p> Honestly, there are just way too many to mention here. If I had to listen to every review by critics, then I would never even have touched some books or discovered a lot of my favorite authors. I mean the Harry Potter series of all books were panned by critics when it was first released and many of them were convinced that it would amount to nothing. I'm guessing that a lot of these critics are feeling pretty stupid after it became such a worldwide success. The same could be said about even older classics like The Great Gatsby and Catcher in The Rye. I could go on and on, but the point is that critics are only human and like they rest of us they have their own tastes when it comes to books. I'm sure there are a lot of people who agree with the assessment by critics, but at the end of the day, it is YOU who will be reading the books and only YOU can decide whether or not they are worth your time. I feel like I should add that I have discovered quite a few critics who I wholeheartedly agree with, so it is probably a case of finding a critic with taste that aligns to your own. </p>

<p> Miss Read was a pen name for the English novelist Dora Jessie Saint. She most often wrote under the name of Miss Read, but also published books under the name of Shafe. Saint came up with the name of Miss Read by taking her mother’s maiden name. In addition to her work as a novelst, she also worked as a schoolmistress. </p>
<p> Dora was born in 1913 in London, but due to her mother’s health, the family would move to the country when Dora was just seven years old. She would attend school there and became inspired when her own father became a schoolmaster to follow in his footsteps. She would go to teacher training at Homerton College, Cambridge to learn her craft. </p>
<p> She would go to work in Middlesex, at Hayes and later at Ealing, until she met her husband, Douglas Saint. The two were married in 1940 and had one daughter. World War II took place which changed a lot at the time and after the war, she only worked occasionally as a teacher. This is when she began getting into writing, starting off by writing about schools and country topics for magazines like Punch. She would also do some work for the BBC schools service as a scriptwriter. </p>
<p> Saint was inspired by the work of Jane Austen and began to write her own novels. She published Village School in 1955, the first book in the Fairacre series of books. After that, she continued writing at a frequent pace and published many novels in her career. </p>
<p> Village School is the first book in the Fairacre series of books. This is the first book featuring Miss Read and her remarkable group of children. The story takes place in the English village of Fairacre which is filled with thatch-roofed cottages, a church, and a school. The town is known just as much for the fair weather as it is for the good cheer. That said, it is a town where everyone knows everyone else’s business which doesn’t stop anyone from liking each other. This first entry sees Miss Read take the reader through one autumn in her village and introduce us to the unforgettable characters of Fairacre. </p>
<p> The Fairacre series then continues with Village Diary. Each month of this book covers a month in the life of Miss Read. This is an exciting time in the town as Fairacre welcomes many newcomers for the village’s country pageant. At this time we meet Mr. Mawne, the man who all of the other villagers want Miss Read to marry. </p>
<p> Storm in the Village is the third book in the Fairacre series. This book sees trouble brewing in the small country village when it is found that Farmer Miller’s Hundred Acre Field is set for a real estate development. This leads to alarming rumors circulating throughout the town, including one that the school may be closing soon. Despite that, Miss Read manages to keep a level head and bring her clear-sighted candor to the report. However, the village is in for a battle to keep their village as it is as they are worried of being engulfed. </p>
<p> Miss Read also penned the Thrush Green series of books. The series begins with a book titled Thrush Green. The story introduces us to the village of Thrush Green, a neighbor of Fairacre, which is filled with enchanting landscapes, blackthorn bushes, and thatch-roofed cottages. This series aims to get you invested in the village’s characters and fates just as the Fairacre series did. </p>
<p> The series of Thrush Green continues with Winter in Thrush Green. The story picks up two years after the last book and focuses on more of the secondary characters from the first book while the main characters fade into the background. You have Mr. Piggott who complains about work while waiting to go to the pub, Ella and Dimity gossiping about their neighbor, and the the headmistress Miss Watson being robbed in her own home. The town is also planning a memorial for a local hero, Nathaniel Patten, as the 100th anniversary of his birth is upcoming. The series remains sweet and charming as the others with each chapter alternating between characters. </p>
<p> The Year at Thrush Green is the 12th book in the Thrush Green series. The book sees spring unfolding and the drama of village life blooming with it. The book offers more stories of the lives of some of the villagers including Dotty Harmer, Albert Piggott, architect Edward Young, and an American stranger who arrives to town looking for some family connections. Miss Read finds a way to tie together all these stories in a satisfying way and capturing the charm of the era. </p>
<p> Miss Read explored another village in Market Square which takes place in the village of Caxley. Life in the village revolves around the Market Square, even at times when the open air market isn’t open. The Howards and the Norths are two families who live here. Their families are coping with their lives and the readers come to care about them in the years before World War II. The book, like much of Read’s work, shows us a simpler time when family and friends was the most important thing to many. </p>
<p> Another great Miss Read book for fans of the Fairacre series and the Thrush Green series is Fresh from the Country. The story begins with a young woman named Anna Lacey who has spent the majority of her young life on a farm in Essex. Now, she has taken her first teaching position which takes her to a new suburb where she has to live in cramped lodgings and teach overcrowded classrooms. She came into her career with idealistic theories about teaching which she now has to change in the face of the reality of her pupils. The book is an accurate look at school life and the people who attended. </p>
<p> One Response to “Miss Read” </p>
<p> Susan Kirkham: 5 months ago </p>
<p> Miss Read’s books make for very soothing reading. I have found them invaluable during the Covid pandemic. Yes they are illustrated which I find charming but that, to my mind does not mean they are a child’s book. The genre is portraying a much gentler time. Of course you can find fault with them for example the pupils attending Fairacre School never change despite the years moving on but I can forgive that because for me I’m not haunted by anything I am reading. I know that Miss Read preferred her Thrush Green characters but I much prefer the Fairacre stories. </p>

<p> 10 Impressive Health Benefits of Apples </p>
<p> Apples are one of the most popular fruits — and for good reason. </p>
<p> They’re an exceptionally healthy fruit with many research-backed benefits. </p>
<p> Here are 10 impressive health benefits of apples. </p>
<p> 1. Apples Are Nutritious </p>
<p> A medium apple — with a diameter of about 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) — equals 1.5 cups of fruit. Two cups of fruit daily are recommended on a 2,000-calorie diet. </p>
<p> One medium apple — 6.4 ounces or 182 grams — offers the following nutrients (1): </p>
<p> Calories: 95 </p>
<p> Carbs: 25 grams </p>
<p> Fiber: 4 grams </p>
<p> Vitamin C: 14% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) </p>
<p> Potassium: 6% of the RDI </p>
<p> Vitamin K: 5% of the RDI </p>
<p> What’s more, the same serving provides 2–4% of the RDI for manganese, copper, and the vitamins A, E, B1, B2, and B6. </p>
<p> Apples are also a rich source of polyphenols. While nutrition labels don’t list these plant compounds, they’re likely responsible for many of the health benefits. </p>
<p> To get the most out of apples, leave the skin on — it contains half of the fiber and many of the polyphenols. </p>
<p> SUMMARY Apples are a good source of fiber and vitamin C. They also contain polyphenols, which may have numerous health benefits. </p>
<p> 2. Apples May Be Good for Weight Loss </p>
<p> Apples are high in fiber and water — two qualities that make them filling. </p>
<p> In one study, people who ate apple slices before a meal felt fuller than those who consumed applesauce, apple juice, or no apple products (2). </p>
<p> In the same study, those who started their meal with apple slices also ate an average of 200 fewer calories than those who didn’t (2). </p>
<p> In another 10-week study in 50 overweight women, participants who ate apples lost an average of 2 pounds (1 kg) and ate fewer calories overall, compared to those who ate oat cookies with a similar calorie and fiber content (3). </p>
<p> Researchers think that apples are more filling because they’re less energy-dense, yet still deliver fiber and volume. </p>
<p> Furthermore, some natural compounds in them may promote weight loss. </p>
<p> A study in obese mice found that those given a supplement of ground apples and apple juice concentrate lost more weight and had lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol than the control group (4). </p>
<p> SUMMARY Apples may aid weight loss in several ways. They’re also particularly filling due to their high fiber content. </p>
<p> 3. Apples May Be Good for Your Heart </p>
<p> Apples have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease (5). </p>
<p> One reason may be that apples contain soluble fiber — the kind that can help lower your blood cholesterol levels. </p>
<p> They also contain polyphenols, which have antioxidant effects. Many of these are concentrated in the peel. </p>
<p> One of these polyphenols is the flavonoid epicatechin, which may lower blood pressure. </p>
<p> An analysis of studies found that high intakes of flavonoids were linked to a 20% lower risk of stroke (6). </p>
<p> Flavonoids can help prevent heart disease by lowering blood pressure, reducing “bad” LDL oxidation, and acting as antioxidants (7). </p>
<p> Another study comparing the effects of eating an apple a day to taking statins — a class of drugs known to lower cholesterol — concluded that apples would be almost as effective at reducing death from heart disease as the drugs (8). </p>
<p> However, since this was not a controlled trial, findings must be taken with a grain of salt. </p>
<p> Another study linked consuming white-fleshed fruits and vegetables, such as apples and pears, to a reduced risk of stroke. For every 25 grams — about 1/5 cup of apple slices — consumed, the risk of stroke decreased by 9% (9). </p>
<p> SUMMARY Apples promote heart health in several ways. They’re high in soluble fiber, which helps lower cholesterol. They also have polyphenols, which are linked to lower blood pressure and stroke risk. </p>
<p> 4. They’re Linked to a Lower Risk of Diabetes </p>
<p> Several studies have linked eating apples to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (10). </p>
<p> In one large study, eating an apple a day was linked to a 28% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, compared to not eating any apples. Even eating just a few apples per week had a similarly protective effect (11). </p>
<p> It’s possible that the polyphenols in apples help prevent tissue damage to beta cells in your pancreas. Beta cells produce insulin in your body and are often damaged in people with type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p> SUMMARY Eating apples is linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. This is possibly due to their polyphenol antioxidant content. </p>
<p> 5. They May Have Prebiotic Effects and Promote Good Gut Bacteria </p>
<p> Apples contain pectin, a type of fiber that acts as a prebiotic. This means it feeds the good bacteria in your gut. </p>
<p> Your small intestine doesn’t absorb fiber during digestion. Instead, it goes to your colon, where it can promote the growth of good bacteria. It also turns into other helpful compounds that circulate back through your body (5). </p>
<p> New research suggests that this may be the reason behind some of the protective effects of apples against obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. </p>
<p> SUMMARY The type of fiber in apples feeds good bacteria and may be the reason they protect against obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p> 6. Substances in Apples May Help Prevent Cancer </p>
<p> Test-tube studies have shown a link between plant compounds in apples and a lower risk of cancer (11). </p>
<p> Additionally, one study in women reported that eating apples was linked to lower rates of death from cancer (12). </p>
<p> Scientists believe that their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects may be responsible for their potential cancer-preventive effects (13). </p>
<p> SUMMARY Apples have several naturally occurring compounds that may help fight cancer. Observational studies have linked them to a lower risk of cancer and death from cancer. </p>
<p> 7. Apples Contain Compounds That Can Help Fight Asthma </p>
<p> Antioxidant-rich apples may help protect your lungs from oxidative damage. </p>
<p> A large study in more than 68,000 women found that those who ate the most apples had the lowest risk of asthma. Eating about 15% of a large apple per day was linked to a 10% lower risk of this condition (11). </p>
<p> Apple skin contains the flavonoid quercetin, which can help regulate the immune system and reduce inflammation. These are two ways in which it may affect asthma and allergic reactions (14). </p>
<p> SUMMARY Apples contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds that may help regulate immune responses and protect against asthma. </p>
<p> 8. Apples May Be Good for Bone Health </p>
<p> Eating fruit is linked to higher bone density, which is a marker of bone health. </p>
<p> Researchers believe that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds in fruit may help promote bone density and strength. </p>
<p> Some studies show that apples, specifically, may positively affect bone health (15). </p>
<p> In one study, women ate a meal that either included fresh apples, peeled apples, applesauce, or no apple products. Those who ate apples lost less calcium from their bodies than the control group (11). </p>
<p> SUMMARY The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds in apples may promote bone health. What’s more, eating fruit may help preserve bone mass as you age. </p>
<p> 9. Apples May Protect Against Stomach Injury From NSAIDs </p>
<p> The class of painkillers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can injure the lining of your stomach. </p>
<p> A study in test tubes and rats found that freeze-dried apple extract helped protect stomach cells from injury due to NSAIDs (11). </p>
<p> Two plant compounds in apples — chlorogenic acid and catechin — are thought to be particularly helpful (11). </p>
<p> However, research in humans is needed to confirm these results. </p>
<p> SUMMARY Apples contain compounds that may help protect your stomach lining from injury due to NSAID painkillers. </p>
<p> 10. Apples May Help Protect Your Brain </p>
<p> Most research focuses on apple peel and flesh. </p>
<p> However, apple juice may have benefits for age-related mental decline. </p>
<p> In animal studies, juice concentrate reduced harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) in brain tissue and minimized mental decline (16). </p>
<p> Apple juice may help preserve acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that can decline with age. Low levels of acetylcholine are linked to Alzheimer’s disease (11). </p>
<p> Similarly, researchers who fed elderly rats whole apples found that a marker of the rats’ memory was restored to the level of younger rats (11). </p>
<p> That said, whole apples contain the same compounds as apple juice — and it is always a healthier choice to eat your fruit whole. </p>
<p> SUMMARY According to animal studies, apple juice may help prevent the decline of neurotransmitters that are involved in memory. </p>
<p> The Bottom Line </p>
<p> Apples are incredibly good for you, and eating them is linked to a lower risk of many major diseases, including diabetes and cancer. </p>
<p> What’s more, its soluble fiber content may promote weight loss and gut health. </p>
<p> A medium apple equals 1.5 cups of fruit — which is 3/4 of the 2-cup daily recommendation for fruit. </p>
<p> For the greatest benefits, eat the whole fruit — both skin and flesh. </p>

<p> 6 Pros and Cons to Eating an Apple a Day </p>
<p> By Paula Martinac Updated November 29, 2018 </p>
<p> Reviewed by Sylvie Tremblay, MSc </p>
<p> ABOUT THE REVIEWER </p>

<p> Apples are great, but like any other food, they should be consumed in moderation. </p>

<p> You know the age-old health aphorism: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." Although no one food can keep disease at bay, apples are nutritious fruits that may help your weight-loss efforts and offer a variety of other health benefits. But should you really be eating an apple a day, or is it possible to get too much of a good thing and turn the advantages into disadvantages? </p>
<p> Apple Nutrition </p>
<p> A large — about 3-1/4 inches in diameter — apple with the skin on it has 116 calories. It has very little protein or fat, with less than a gram of each, and 31 grams of carbohydrates. Of those carbs, over 5 grams are from fiber, making apples a high-fiber fruit. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> The same size apple is also a good source of vitamins and minerals. The vitamin C in one large apple is notable, fulfilling 11 percent of a man's daily requirement and 13 percent of a woman's. One large apple also gives you 5 percent of your daily requirement of the mineral potassium, which is associated with healthier blood pressure. </p>
<p> Benefits of Eating Apples </p>
<p> 1. Weight Management </p>
<p> The fiber in one large apple provides you with a wealth of benefits. In one study, published in PloS One in 2015, adding apple fiber — a water-soluble type called pectin — to the diets of rats lowered their intake of food and helped decrease weight and body fat. The researchers concluded that apple pectin supports satiety and weight management. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 2. Bowel Health </p>
<p> Getting adequate fiber also assists with bowel movements and keeps you regular and may improve your cholesterol levels, lowering your risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. There's some evidence, too, that fiber may help protect you from colon cancer, although more research is needed. Men need 38 grams of fiber daily for optimum health, and women need 25, so just one large apple will satisfy 13 to 20 percent of your daily requirement. </p>
<p> 3. Fight Free Radical Damage </p>
<p> Apples are rich in antioxidants such as vitamin C, which help fight off free radicals, molecules that can damage DNA and make you susceptible to illnesses such as heart disease and cancer. A review of studies, published in the Annals of Oncology in 2005, reported that eating one or more apples daily helped protect subjects from many different types of cancer, including esophageal, breast, colon and ovarian. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In addition to vitamin C, apples contain antioxidant phytochemicals like quercetin, catechins and chlorogenic acid. In fact, the antioxidant activity of the compounds in apples is higher than that of many other fruits, such as grapes, strawberries, pears and oranges. </p>
<p> Disadvantages of Eating Apples </p>
<p> 1. Possible Gas and Bloating </p>
<p> You will encounter a few downsides to eating apples every day. If you aren't accustomed to eating fiber, suddenly embarking on a regimen of eating apples every day may lead to uncomfortable gas and bloating. Add fiber from apples and other foods to your diet gradually, phasing it in over a few weeks, and make sure to drink plenty of water to help the fiber pass through your digestive tract. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> 2. Apple Allergy </p>
<p> Some people are allergic to apples and related fruits. If you have an allergy to birch pollen, you may develop an allergy to apples, too, and have to refrain from eating them. Symptoms can range from hives, abdominal pain and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis. However, you may be able to eat apples without the peel. </p>
<p> 3. Pesticide Exposure </p>
<p> Apples top the list of "dirty" produce, according to the Environmental Working Group. If you are concerned about high levels of pesticides in your food, purchase organic apples instead. However, organic produce can be more expensive than conventionally grown, leading to a bigger tab at the grocery store. </p>
<p> Ways to Eat Apples Every Day </p>
<p> Eating an apple a day is easy with such a portable fruit. Keep a bowl of washed apples on the counter, and grab one on your way to school or work. Apples also make delicious additions to a host of dishes. </p>
<p> Top your morning oatmeal or yogurt with cut-up apple and raisins, or slice some apple onto your lunch or dinner salad along with grilled chicken. An apple with 2 tablespoons of almond butter is a satisfying snack to enjoy after your exercise routine; an apple baked with a dab of butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon makes a nutritious dessert to satisfy your sweet tooth. </p>

<p> 5 Day Apple Diet Plan to Lose 10 Pounds in a Week </p>
<p> It is a very low-calorie diet plan that includes apples for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. </p>
<p> Proponents of the apple diet claim this program can help you lose weight quickly by merely following a 5-day meal plan. </p>
<p> In fact, some articles tout that you can lose 3 to 10 pounds in a week while on this diet. </p>
<p> These promises are based on the belief that apples can aid in weight loss by making you feel fuller and decreasing hunger pangs, which ultimately causes you to eat less. </p>
<p> Additionally, sources also claim that following the 5-day apple diet may have health benefits, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, and a stronger immune system. </p>
<p> Proponents also claim that this diet can “detox” the body of “toxins.” </p>
<p> Can a short-term diet deliver on these many promises? More importantly, is it safe? </p>
<p> This article will provide an overview of the apple diet and closely examine these claims. </p>
<p> What Is the Apple Diet? </p>
<p> The apple diet is a 5-day apple weight loss diet and includes a meal plan that is 1200-calories per day or less. </p>
<p> As you may have guessed from the name, this low-calorie menu includes plenty of whole apples. </p>
<p> In fact, proponents of this diet claim that eating 5 apples a day will drive weight loss and improve health. </p>
<p> While some meals on this diet contain only apples, other meals also offer lean proteins, whole grains, and veggies. </p>
<p> Below you will find an example of the 5-day apple diet plan. </p>
<p> As you are reading this, keep in mind that the diet plan is too low calorie for most people. </p>
<p> We’ll discuss more about this later in the article. </p>
<p> 5-Day Apple Diet Menu </p>

<p> Foods that are not allowed include: </p>
<p> Lard, butter, and mayonnaise </p>
<p> Packaged fruit juices, sodas, and alcohol </p>
<p> Processed meat and pork </p>
<p> Junk foods, including processed sweets and desserts </p>
<p> However, keep in mind that there are no established guidelines for the apple diet, and there may be different versions of this diet with differing food rules. </p>
<p> Are Apples Good for Weight Loss? </p>
<p> Overall, apples may be a useful tool to help promote body weight loss, along with healthy lifestyle changes. </p>
<p> This is mainly because apples are high in fiber and water content, making them a filling food. </p>
<p> Apples are also lower in calories, with only 95 calories in one medium apple. </p>
<p> Some health experts hypothesize that the filling nature of apples may encourage you to eat less during the day, ultimately helping with weight loss. </p>
<p> One recent study consisting of 58 adults found that the participants who ate apple slices before a meal felt fuller than those who consumed applesauce, apple juice, or no apple products (1). </p>
<p> Additionally, those who started their meals with apple slices consumed an average of 200 fewer calories compared to participants who had no apple snack at the start of the meal (1). </p>
<p> In a different 10-week trial consisting of 49 overweight women, participants who ate three apples per day lost an average of 3 pounds and ate fewer calories in a day compared to participants who consumed three oat cookies, which were equal to the apples in total grams of fiber (2). </p>
<p> The researchers speculated that the lower energy density of the apples played a role in weight loss. </p>
<p> This could mean that eating a diet high in fruits, which are low energy density foods, could help with weight maintenance. </p>
<p> Potential Health Benefits of Apples </p>
<p> Apples are an exceptionally healthy fruit and are a source of fiber, vitamin C, potassium, vitamin K, vitamin A, and vitamin B6. </p>
<p> In fact, one medium apple with the peel contains the following nutrients (3): </p>
<p> Fiber: 4 grams of fiber </p>
<p> Carbs: 25 grams </p>
<p> Sugar: 13 grams of sugar </p>
<p> Vitamin C: 14% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) </p>
<p> Vitamin K: 5% of the RDI </p>
<p> Vitamin A: 2% of the RDI </p>
<p> Vitamin B6: 4% of the RDI </p>
<p> Apples are also a rich source of polyphenols and phytochemicals- compounds found in plants that may protect against chronic diseases. </p>
<p> There is some research to suggest that apples are associated with heart health. </p>
<p> This is because apples contain soluble fiber, which has been linked to lower blood cholesterol levels and better blood sugar or glucose control. </p>
<p> Apples are also a source of antioxidants known as flavonoids, which may help protect against heart disease by lowering blood pressure, reducing “bad” LDL cholesterol, and protecting against inflammation, chronic inflammation, and damage from free radicals (4). </p>
<p> One large review analysis found that high intakes of flavonoids from plant and tea sources were linked to a 20% lower risk of stroke when compared to low intakes of flavonoids (5). </p>
<p> Consuming apples may also be beneficial for gut health. </p>
<p> Apples contain a soluble fiber known as pectin, which acts as a prebiotic. </p>
<p> This means that pectin is a food source for the “good” bacteria in your colon and digestive system. </p>
<p> Some new research hypothesizes that apples may have a protective effect against obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes by helping to maintain healthy gut bacteria (6). </p>
<p> Please keep in mind that these are the potential benefits of eating apples as part of a varied diet with other healthy foods. </p>
<p> It is not a list of the potential benefits of the apple diet. </p>
<p> There is currently no research that examines the effects of the apple diet on weight loss or health. </p>
<p> Can You Lose Weight by Eating Only Apples? </p>
<p> Apples are a nutritional powerhouse and may have the potential to help with weight loss, mainly due to their fiber and high water content. </p>
<p> However, it is not likely that only eating apples will result in long-term weight loss. </p>
<p> This is because any diet that advocates eating only one food, such as apples, is not sustainable, and therefore, is not a healthy way to lose weight. </p>
<p> While 5 days on the apple diet is possible, eating the same foods and such little calories every day could lead individuals to abandon this plan. </p>
<p> Additionally, any extra pounds that you might lose by only eating apples will likely return as quickly as they left once you resume a regular diet. </p>
<p> How Many Apples Should I Eat a Day to Lose Weight? </p>
<p> Proponents of this diet would have you believe that eating five apples a day will result in weight loss. </p>
<p> As previously mentioned, there is some scientific evidence that including apples in your diet may help you lose weight. </p>
<p> One study found that participants who ate three apples per day lost an average of 3 pounds during the 10-week clinical trial compared to participants who consumed three oat cookies (2). </p>
<p> However, more research is needed to determine the connection between apple consumption and weight loss. </p>
<p> Currently, no evidence suggests eating more of any specific food will lead to weight loss without additional lifestyle changes. </p>
<p> Overall, the foods you eat will likely not produce weight change unless combined with healthy lifestyle choices. </p>
<p> Ultimately, there is no magic food or “best fruit” that will burn body fat or trim your waistline, and most of the weight you lose on the apple menu will be due to the calorie restriction. </p>
<p> Does This Diet Work? </p>
<p> The apple diet may result in short-term weight loss but is likely not a good strategy for long-term weight maintenance. </p>
<p> This is because the apple weight loss diet lowers your daily calorie intake to less than 1,200 calories per day, which creates a calorie deficit. </p>
<p> A calorie deficit occurs when you eat fewer calories per day than you burn and is the primary driver of weight loss while on any diet. </p>
<p> However, any weight that is lost on this diet will likely be temporary, and promises of a 10-pound weight loss in only a week are unrealistic and unsustainable. </p>
<p> Research has shown that low-calorie diets rarely result in permanent weight change. </p>
<p> Most individuals will experience weight regain after completing this short-term diet unless they have a plan to maintain these changes (7). </p>
<p> Is This Diet Evidence-Based? </p>
<p> Currently, there are no studies on this diet. </p>
<p> Additionally, there is little information on the apple diet, which could point to this being a relatively new fad. </p>
<p> Without high-quality, recent research, it is impossible to compare this diet’s efficacy and safety to other, well-researched diets and eating patterns. </p>
<p> Potential Drawbacks of The Apple Diet </p>
<p> Limited Variety of Nutrients </p>
<p> One drawback of this diet is that it lacks variety during the diet period. </p>
<p> Due to the extensive calorie restriction and reliance on apples, most people will not consume enough vitamins (such as folate), minerals (such as calcium), protein, and unsaturated fats (a type of fat that is good for heart health) during the diet days. </p>
<p> For example, the first day of this diet consists of only apples, which are low in protein and heart-healthy fats. </p>
<p> This approach may be counterintuitive as research suggests that high-protein diet plans may help reduce appetite and promote weight loss (8). </p>
<p> Additionally, eating a diet with a moderate amount of heart-healthy or good fats has actually been shown to increase feelings of satiety and decrease hunger. </p>
<p> This is because fat is known to slow digestion, which can help you feel fuller. </p>
<p> The apple diet is notably low in dietary fat. </p>
<p> Furthermore, by eating mostly apples in your diet, you may inadvertently replace other, nutritious fruits, such as pears, watermelon, bananas, strawberries, pineapple, blueberries, and grapefruits. </p>
<p> Different fruits contain different types of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals, so it is important to eat a variety of fruits and veggies. </p>
<p> For example, citrus fruits such as pineapple and grapefruit have more vitamin C than apples and bananas have more potassium. </p>
<p> Too Low in Calories </p>
<p> According to proponents of the apple diet, this diet program is a 1,200 calorie meal plan. However, after examining some of the meal plans currently circulating the internet, it appears that most days are less than 1,200 calories. </p>
<p> While temporarily following a very low-calorie diet may be safe for well-nourished adults, it is not recommended for everyone. </p>
<p> Also, it should only be undertaken with the help of healthcare professionals or nutritionists. </p>
<p> You should not follow a very low-calorie diet if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, trying to conceive, are underweight, or have a history of eating disorders. </p>
<p> Additionally, the apple diet is too low in calories for long-term use and could result in nutrient deficiencies and a decrease in metabolism (9). </p>
<p> Therefore, consuming too few calories to lose weight can quickly backfire and may even cause you to gain weight as your metabolism slows. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that daily calorie estimates range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for adult women and 2,000 to 3,000 calories for adult men (10). </p>
<p> Weight Regain and Yo-Yo Dieting </p>
<p> The apple diet is a short-term, 5-day weight loss plan. </p>
<p> One of the problems with these quick weight loss diets is that you may regain weight once you stop following the menu plan. </p>
<p> This cycle of dieting, gaining weight, and dieting again is sometimes referred to as yo-yo dieting. </p>
<p> Research has linked yo-yo dieting to potential health problems, including increased appetite, greater weight gain over time, and increased body and stomach fat. </p>
<p> For example, one review study found that people on short-term diets regained 30 to 65% of the weight they had lost within one year after the diet (11). </p>
<p> In a different review article, 11 out of 19 studies determined that a history of yo-yo dieting was associated with higher percentages of body fat and greater amounts of stomach or belly fat (12). </p>
<p> Unfortunately, fad diets, such as the apple diet, can encourage yo-yo dieting since these programs do not provide any guidance for long-term weight maintenance and are often too low in calories to sustain. </p>
<p> Additional Considerations </p>
<p> As you might imagine, the most likely side-effect of this diet is hunger. Any diet that is so low in calories will cause hunger pangs. </p>
<p> You may also experience headaches and food cravings. The apple diet can also result in digestive distress, including stomach pain and diarrhea. </p>
<p> This is because apples contain a natural sugar known as fructose, which may have a laxative effect when consumed in large quantities. </p>
<p> Consuming too many apples may cause problems for individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. </p>
<p> Apples are high in carbohydrates known as FODMAPs that can cause digestive distress, such as gas, stomach cramps, constipation, and diarrhea, in some people. </p>
<p> Additionally, apples are a decent source of vitamin K, and individuals who are taking warfarin or Coumadin should speak with their doctor before making any changes to their current diet. </p>
<p> Warfarin is a blood thinner that helps prevent or treat blood clots by interfering with vitamin K clotting factors. </p>
<p> It is recommended that individuals taking this medication maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K from food (including apples), as significant changes to the diet can alter this drug’s effectiveness. </p>
<p> Final Thoughts </p>
<p> Overall, the apple diet appears to be another fad diet and has no real merit to back its many claims. </p>
<p> While this diet may help with quick weight loss, the weight will likely return once you stop dieting and is not a great way to maintain your weight. </p>
<p> Outside of a handful of small studies, there is no evidence to suggest that apples have any magical power other than the fact that they are a nutritious, low calorie, high-fiber food. </p>
<p> Additionally, most of the research on apples’ overall health benefits looks at including apples as part of a balanced, healthy diet. </p>
<p> There is no evidence that consuming five apples a day will cause an increase in these benefits. </p>
<p> In fact, consuming mostly apples can displace other, nutritious fruits and veggies from your diet. </p>
<p> Instead of focusing on just apples, try aiming for the recommended 2 to 2.5 servings of fruit per day. Apples can be part of these servings or added to the diet as a healthy snack, but you do not need to follow the apple weight loss diet to reap their health benefits. </p>
<p> Ultimately, this diet is just another “quick fix” fad and may not be a good idea for long-term, healthy weight loss. </p>
<p> Instead of following this diet, try focusing on healthy habits to set you up for long-term success. </p>
<p> The best way to start may be to cut back on processed foods and added sugar, eat a variety of fruits and veggies, establish a workout or gym routine, drink plenty of water, and get enough sleep. </p>

<p> Can Beagles Eat Apples? </p>
<p> Apple is a common fruit. For some time, Apple has been considered one of the most healthy foods for humans because it contains a lot of vitamins and minerals. </p>
<p> Studies have shown that eating Apples may help lower cholesterol levels and prevent certain types of cancer. </p>
<p> But what about Beagles? Can Beagles eat Apples? </p>
<p> Beagles can eat apples, which are a great source of vitamins A and C. They also contain fiber, potassium, and phytonutrients for beagle owners to take advantage of. </p>
<p> Be sure not to feed them entire apples, however. If they are not properly chewed, it can cause intestinal blockages, which is a serious problem for beagles. </p>
<p> One medium-sized apple’s nutritional value </p>
<p> Why are apples good for Beagles? </p>
<p> Apples contain vitamins A and C which are essential in strengthening the immune system of Beagles. </p>
<p> Vitamins also help prevent cancer and heart disease which are two of the biggest killers among dogs. </p>
<p> In addition, apples are rich in fiber, an essential component for a healthy digestive tract. A dog suffering from constipation can be helped by eating apples because of their high fiber content. </p>
<p> Moreover, apples are rich in antioxidants and phytonutrients. Antioxidants protect the body from diseases by preventing cellular damage caused by free radicals. </p>
<p> Phytonutrients enhance the effects of antioxidants so they can fight more effectively. </p>
<p> How to feed apples to your dog? </p>
<p> Apple slices are the best way to feed apples to your Beagle. </p>
<p> Be sure not to give them whole apples because they contain seeds and a lot of pulp that can cause digestive problems for your dog. </p>
<p> Never feed them seeds, the core, or any part of apple trees as these parts are toxic to dogs. It is highly recommended to avoid apples if your dog has digestive problems. </p>
<p> Beagles are known to be picky eaters but once they get used to eating apples as a snack, they will surely enjoy it. </p>
<p> Freeze apple sauce in an ice cube tray and give them one or two pieces. </p>
<p> How often should you feed Beagles Apples? </p>
<p> Beagles can have apples as a snack or treat anytime. </p>
<p> You should always thoroughly wash the apple before giving it to your pet so that it’s clean and free of dirt, pesticides, and other harmful impurities. </p>
<p> Wash them in running water, peel them if necessary, and cut them into small pieces for your pet to enjoy eating. </p>
<p> Don’t feed them too much as it may upset the stomach of your pet. </p>
<p> Can beagle puppies eat apples? </p>
<p> Beagle puppies can eat apples but in moderation. Too many apples can cause gastrointestinal upset. </p>
<p> Moreover, apples are high in sugar content, which can cause them to gain weight. </p>
<p> In fact, too much sugar is unhealthy for puppies so it is best avoided except only as a treat or when used to lure the beagle into taking medication such as pills. </p>
<p> Can pregnant beagles eat apples? </p>
<p> Yes, pregnant beagles can eat apples. Apples are an excellent source of vitamins and minerals which is why they should be included in the diet of pregnant females. </p>
<p> In addition, apples are high in fiber which helps prevent constipation and other pregnancy-related issues. </p>
<p> Pregnant beagles should be fed apples only as a treat, not on a regular basis. If eaten too often or too much, they could upset the stomach of pregnant females just like any other dog. </p>
<p> Can old beagles eat apples? </p>
<p> It’s a great snack, especially for senior beagles. Like many other dogs, apples help soothe an upset stomach and ease indigestion in older canines, making them less likely to have gas and flatulence. </p>
<p> But make sure older beagles don’t eat too many apples, especially if they are on medication. </p>
<p> Its natural sugar content can cause them to gain weight, and diabetes is a typical problem for senior beagles. </p>
<p> Note: Remove seeds and core first as they are not recommended for beagles. </p>
<p> Can beagle eat apple cores? </p>
<p> No, beagles should not eat apple cores. Apple seeds contain cyanide that is produced if the seed is cut open or bitten into. </p>
<p> As little as one seed is harmful to beagles so never feed them their core, just throw it away after cutting. </p>
<p> Can beagle eat apple seeds? </p>
<p> No, apple seeds can be poisonous to dogs so it’s best not to feed them. </p>
<p> Apple seeds are a type of amygdalin, which is found in the pits or seeds of apples (and other fruits). </p>
<p> Amygdalin breaks down into hydrogen cyanide when these seeds are chewed on. Hydrogen cyanide is a colorless and flammable gas that has a distinctive bitter almond smell. </p>
<p> Hydrogen cyanide is highly toxic and can be fatal to dogs and other mammals. Exposure results in rapid breathing, irregular heart function, coma, convulsions, and death within hours from respiratory failure. </p>
<p> Final Verdict </p>
<p> Apples are very healthy for Beagles. But you have to make sure that the apple core, seeds, and other parts of the tree are not given to your pet as they can be dangerous. </p>
<p> Never give them whole apples or any big chunk of the fruit. Always slice them first into thin slices so they can easily be digestible. </p>

<p> Do Deer Eat Apples? </p>
<p> Deer are one of the most recognized animals in North America. Most people have seen a whitetail deer, while hunters specifically will spend a lot of time with these animals. Still, how many people know what a deer eats? They probably know it’s fruit, plant stuff, or vegetables, but not exactly what they eat. For example, can a deer eat apples? </p>
<p> Yes, deer do eat apples. That’s the short answer, but not the whole story. </p>
<p> Deer Do Eat Apples But Not Exclusively </p>
<p> While deer do eat apples, it should in no way become their staple diet. Think of apple as a candy treat for deer. They find them delicious, but it is hardly good for them to eat exclusively. Deer enjoy apples but have difficulty digesting them. In fact, if deer exclusively eat apples there’s a good chance the animal will starve to death. Apples do not provide deer the full nutrients it needs to be healthy and often interfere with their seasonal diets during winter. </p>
<p> Similar trends happen every year with corn feeding. During winter people worry deer will starve in the wild, cold, and harsh conditions. Out of concern, they may leave out a bag of corn or apples for deer to eat, or may try other means of feeding deer. </p>
<p> Naturally, the deer will gobble this down without giving it much thought. A few weeks later that deer may still die of starvation. </p>
<p> Below you can read why this interesting contradiction (feed a deer which then dies of starvation) happens and under what circumstances you can feed white tails apple. </p>
<p> When Can Deer Eat Apples? </p>
<p> You may be wondering what all the fuss is about. After-all, you have observed wild deer eating apple on a hike or even in your garden. That’s true and apple is a part of a deer diet, but it is all about availability. Remember when we called apple like candy for deer? </p>
<p> Apple is not readily available to deer. It grows in trees and is usually out of reach, which means deer only access apple when the fruit falls to the ground or they are fed it by humans. </p>
<p> Whitetail stomachs can handle apple in small quantities. In fact a deer will likely gobble down this treat with glee. Apples contain ample calories for deer, and they will even eat an apple that is starting to rot after falling from a tree. </p>
<p> How Deer Digest Their Food </p>
<p> Deer stomachs contain millions of microorganisms that can break down just about anything within the animal’s specialist range of foods. For example, they can handle the messy wood stuffs and leaves deer eat during winter. </p>
<p> Deer can handle corn and apples but they have some trouble digesting these foods. </p>
<p> Whitetails struggle with radical changes to their diet. If they have been foraging during winter and suddenly munch down on a pile of corn until they are full, those microorganisms won’t like it. </p>
<p> The deer leaves full, but the digestive system will not be able to process all that corn and the deer may starve. Some may survive, but when their diet again switches back to woody materials, the stomach again goes into flux and puts the animal at risk. </p>
<p> Winter Feeding </p>
<p> Winter conditions across many deer ranges around the world can get harsh. Whitetails have many challenges during winter weather in North America. Forests and open spaces the deer use suddenly become covered in a thick layer of foot-high snow and plants die off. This leaves deer eating a diet of dead leaves, tree bark, woody browse, and lichens. </p>
<p> Sounds depressing, right? Well, the deer isn’t a fan of it either. It’s something that has been programmed in whitetails for hundreds of thousands of years, and probably longer. </p>
<p> Deer are foraging animals by nature, during the summer it is easy to find food and during the winter it is not. During the winter season, the digestive system of deer is fine-tuned for foraging and living off the bare sustenance it can get. </p>
<p> Almost all whitetails will lose over 20% of their body weight during winter. Winter is also nature’s way of removing weaker animals from the ecosystem. It is not nice to think about, but it’s the reality of nature. </p>
<p> Of course, many well-meaning people think they can help deer by feeding them, and corn or apples are a common choice. </p>
<p> Using Apples to Attract Deer </p>
<p> For hunters, there are some clear pros and cons to using apple to attract deer. </p>
<p> On the pro side, deer love apples and are likely to come to them when they’re used as a lure. If you happen to be in wait, apples take longer to eat than other foodstuffs and may keep the deer distracted for longer. </p>
<p> One major con to using apple to attract deer is other animals also love them. You are just as likely to attract raccoons (or worse, bears) than you are a deer. </p>
<p> If you live in a non-urban area that sits within deer territory, having an apple tree in your garden is a great way to attract deer. Again, there some problems because apples will also attract other animals so if you’re sole purpose is to observe deer up close, perhaps look for another way to attract them … or prepare to have foxes and raccoons also become frequent visitors to your garden. </p>

<p> Here's What Actually Happens When You Eat An Apple Every Day </p>
<p> Apples are one of America's favorite fruits, and it's not hard to see why. Red or green, apples are nutritional powerhouses (and they're even better if you choose organic). According to the Harvard School of Public Health, eating apples has been proven to help with everything from weight loss to heart health. Since they're easy to toss in your bag and eat on-the-go, apples have earned their place as one of the most convenient healthy snacks. </p>
<p> The average American eats nearly 17 pounds of apples per year (via Statista), and sliced apples are even served at fast food restaurants like McDonald's. But what happens to your health when you eat an apple every day? Does an apple's sweetness hide a poisonous secret? (Spoiler: Nope, eating an apple a day is good for you.) </p>

<p> Apples and oranges might be different, but they're both great sources of vitamin C. Per Self's Nutrition Data, a medium apple provides 14 percent of the recommended daily use of vitamin C, as well as six percent of your recommended potassium. Apples are jam-packed with flavonoids, naturally occurring chemicals with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (via the Harvard School of Public Health.) And because apples are 85 percent water, they're hydrating as well as filling, according to Nola.com. </p>
<p> Apples are also a great source of fiber, with 4.4 grams of fiber in every medium-sized fruit. According to the Mayo Clinic, high fiber diets do more than regulate your digestive system; they can also lower cholesterol, help control blood sugar levels, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancers. Plus, roughly 20 percent of an apple's fruit consists of pectin, which has been linked to lower cholesterol (via Healthline.) That makes a daily apple a sweet part of a high fiber nutrition plan. </p>
<p> Apples help with good gut bacteria </p>

<p> Eating apples is great for your gut health. Per Washington State University, a study showed that the non-digestible compounds in apples contribute to the growth of healthy bacteria. Having healthy gut bacteria helps ward off viruses and other harmful bacteria (via University of California, Davis Health.) Adding apples to your diet can have a major effect on your overall gut health, too. According to food scientist Giuliana Noratto, "Obese people have an out-of-balance gut. So changing our gut bacteria via what we eat, making it similar to that of a lean person, could help prevent weight gain." (via Fox News) </p>
<p> While there are hundreds of apple varieties, one kind of apple provides the most gut health benefits: the humble Granny Smith. Granny Smiths outperformed Fuji, Gala, McIntosh, and other popular varieties when it came to the concentration of fiber and low level of carbohydrates. That doesn't mean you have to bump red apples off the table. Nutritionist Fiona Tuck told the Huffington Post that while green apples slightly outperform with fiber, red apples have slightly more antioxidants. Bottom line: Any color of apple will be beneficial for your health. </p>
<p> You can actually eat more than one apple a day </p>

<p> When it comes to apples, it's hard to get too much of a good thing. Nutritionist Leslie Beck told The Globe and Mail that eating an apple a day is perfectly safe and won't add too much sugar to your diet. Beck suggests aiming to consume two to three servings of fruit every day. That means, while eating one apple a day has plenty of benefits, it's safe to eat even more. The United Kingdom National Health Service reported that eating two apples per day can help cut cholesterol levels by four percent. </p>
<p> Craving a third apple? One study in the journal Nutrition showed that eating three apples (or pears) per day helped overweight women lose weight. While it might be safe to eat even more apples, there are some downsides. LiveStrong notes that eating too much fiber can cause bloating, and despite their low calorie count, too many apples can help you pack on the pounds. Still, an apple or two a day has more benefits than drawbacks. And while it won't necessarily keep the doctor away, eating an apple a day might keep another medical professional at bay: the pharmacist. According to a JAMA study, daily apple eaters tend to take fewer prescription medicines. </p>
<p> Apple juice doesn't provide the same benefits </p>

<p> Sweet, tart apple juice tastes delicious, whether it's added to a green juice or sipped by itself. Unfortunately, apple juice strips away most of the nutritional benefits of just eating an apple. According to Healthline, apple juice is high in sugar and low in fiber. Not only does that mean missing out on fiber's benefits for your digestive system, it means apple juice will leave you feeling hungry sooner than if you ate an apple instead. When you do drink apple juice, try to pair it with a protein. One study showed that eating peanut butter alongside a breakfast with apple juice reduces the magnitude of blood sugar spikes. </p>
<p> To get maximum health benefits from an apple, put your peeler away! Apple skin is responsible for most of the fiber and nutrients in apples, according to the Harvard School of Public Health. Peeling an apple more than halves the amount of fiber in the fruit (via Huffington Post.) If you're really hardcore, an apple's core will provide additional nutritional benefits. According to Today, apple cores contain more healthy bacteria than just the apple flesh. But however you eat an apple, your body will be glad you did. </p>

<p> 9 Reasons to Eat an Apple Every Day </p>
<p> Starre Vartan is an environmental and science journalist. She holds an MFA degree from Columbia University and Geology and English degrees from Syracuse University. </p>
<p> You've heard the old "apple a day" expression. The original has been traced back to 1866 and was: "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread." Science seems to be backing up this old idea up. </p>
<p> From brand new medical research to common sense advice, here are several reasons to eat a nutritious apple every day. </p>
<p> 1. Apples contain an anti-aging compound. </p>
<p> Some of how we age is uncontrollable — it's in our genes. But some of how fast we age — and how healthfully we do so — is under our control. Scientists are always looking for ways to slow down aging, no matter our genetic destiny. In a study published in EBioMedicine by the Lancet, they looked at which flavonoids (naturally occurring compounds in fruits and vegetables) had the most antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. </p>
<p> They discovered that fisetin, which is found in apples, strawberries, cucumbers, persimmons and onions, had the strongest effects. "Administration of fisetin to wild-type mice late in life ... extended median and maximum lifespan," the researchers wrote. The tests also were run on human fat tissue to see if the results translated — and they did. </p>
<p> "These results suggest that we can extend the period of health, termed healthspan, even towards the end of life," professor Paul D. Robbins from the University of Minnesota, told Medical News Today. </p>
<p> 2. They're packed with soluble fiber. </p>
<p> A high-fiber diet is important for digestive health and keeping cholesterol low. Fiber also has been shown to reduce the risk of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity and diverticulitis. According to the Mayo Clinic, one apple with the peel on has about 4.4 grams of soluble fiber, which depending on your age, is about 15 percent of the daily recommended intake. </p>
<p> 3. They can lower your asthma risk. </p>
<p> A study in Australia of 1,600 people and another study in the U.K. of 1,500 people both found that apples increased pulmonary health in general and reduced the risk of asthma, according to a study published in Nutrition Journal. Researchers found that people who ate five apples a week saw the biggest boost in respiratory health. </p>
<p> 4. Apples are excellent thirst-quenchers. </p>
<p> Did you know apples are 86 percent water? If you're looking for ways to stay hydrated during the day, toss a sturdy apple into your bag for a refreshing treat. </p>
<p> 5. Apple cider vinegar is all-around awesome. </p>
<p> Throughout history, apple cider vinegar has been used as a natural remedy for everything from soothing sore throats to relieving acid reflux to getting rid of the hiccups. </p>
<p> 6. Apples can help with weight loss. </p>
<p> This one isn't rocket science. Apples are a fruit, they have no fat or artificial ingredients, and as previously mentioned, they're high in fiber and water. So it's common sense that eating apples instead of, say, a bag of chips or a candy bar is a smarter nutritional decision that will lead to less weight gain. A study published in the journal Nutrition found that women who ate three apples each day were more likely to lose weight than women who didn't. </p>
<p> 7. They have very few calories. </p>
<p> Depending on the size of your apple, it probably has about 90 calories. Which is another point in support of the claim above about weight loss. </p>
<p> 8. They have a plethora of vitamins and minerals. </p>
<p> Apples have about 14 percent of your daily recommended intake of vitamin C and 5% of the recommended amount of vitamin B6. They have 2% of your daily vitamin A, calcium and iron needs. And with 195 milligrams of potassium, an apple has 6% of your daily potassium needs. </p>
<p> 9. They're delicious and versatile! </p>
<p> Make apple sauce, apple butter or apple jelly. Cook up a pie or cobbler. Taste different-colored apples from red to green to yellow. Go savory and incorporate apples into chicken or pork recipes, or add chopped apples to stuffing. Or just eat the fruit as-is in its perfect, natural form. </p>
<p> No matter how you choose to eat an apple, leave the skin on — it's where most of the nutrients are. </p>
