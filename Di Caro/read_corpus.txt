<p> Thriller </p>
<p> Emily, the high-powered talent agent. Doug, the tech guru. Chloe, the receptionist and aspiring starlet. Reader beware: these are not good people. All have myriad faults and absolutely rabid ambition, and they are on a crash course toward their own destruction. Mind you, they’ll go down in the most glamorous fashion. A-list celebrities, private planes, a house perched on the ocean in Malibu. Which makes it so very hard to look away. I found myself unable to put down this dazzling debut novel once I started reading. I needed to see it through to the end, after the crash, and discover who is left standing when all is said and done. The Receptionist shows us the glitter (and the not-so-hidden grime) of starry Los Angeles through the gimlet eye of former television producer Kate Myles. During her TV career, she witnessed the highs and lows, the egos and drive for perfection, and has managed to write a page-turner on par with those by masters of psychological suspense like Gillian Flynn and Paula Hawkins. Welcome to the show, Kate Myles. I am so glad you’re here. </p>
<p> Contemporary Romance </p>
<p> Ever wonder what it would be like to marry your best childhood friend? For me, it would surely be a disaster. (Sorry, Stephanie P.) But for Phronsie Linnelle, it may be exactly what she needs to move past her stalled love life and get started on making a family. So when Judd Kovac, her best friend since kindergarten, suggests they get married, she says yes. Because...why not? She’s still waiting for true love. So is he. They’re fully aware of each other’s annoying habits and they still like each other. And everyone knows that passion eventually fizzles. Plus, because they’re such good friends, they’ll never get jealous, never run out of things to talk about, and best of all, they’ll make excellent parents. But as the wedding planning gets underway, Phronsie’s heart keeps tugging at her sleeve, softly whispering something she can’t quite make out. And to further complicate things, she’s getting conflicting advice from friends, family, and even the occasional stranger. Phronsie’s in a predicament, to say the least, as author Maddie Dawson delightfully flips the script on the old saying The heart says yes but the head says no. Ultimately, it’s up to Phronsie to decide whether to listen to her heart or her head—and figure out whether there’s a difference between loving and being in love. </p>
<p> Suspense </p>
<p> What is it we love about the story of Jane Eyre? Why has it endured for nearly 175 years? For me, this enduring ghost story has everything: an atmospheric estate with secrets behind each door, the brooding Mr. Rochester, and an unlikely romance between him and Jane. In Mrs. Rochester’s Ghost, Lindsay Marcott has brilliantly reimagined Jane Eyre in contemporary Northern California. Thorn Bluffs is the picturesque seaside home of Silicon Valley tech god Evan Rochester, who recently lost his gorgeous and damaged model wife in a drowning accident. There are some who believe it was no accident and think Evan a monster. When our thoroughly modern Jane arrives to tutor Rochester’s daughter, she begins seeing things that make her question her sanity. Did she see the woman in her window? Are things going missing from her cottage? Against her better judgment, Jane finds herself falling for the proud and mysterious Mr. Rochester. With that love, she may have to turn a blind eye to the mirages of the late Mrs. Rochester—and finally give up on competing with a ghost. </p>
<p> Young Adult </p>
<p> For fans of Never Have I Ever and Fresh Off the Boat, and for those who love stories centered around small towns, comes a novel so charming and witty, I found myself (almost) wishing I was back in high school. Sheeryl Lim’s Brown Boy Nowhere is a fish-out-of-water story about a young man whose family is hoping for a fresh start. They move from a diverse community in San Diego to a landlocked farming community in the Midwest, where his parents are opening a restaurant. Angelo is one of the few people of color in school, and certainly his is the only Filipino American family in town. As he begins to form his own group of misfits and develops a crush on an ex-cheerleader he never thought would be his type, he grapples with accepting small-town life, where he soon discovers different rules apply. Based on the author’s own experiences moving across the country, this book is a refreshing story of a family and community changed for the good. </p>
<p> Psychological Thriller </p>
<p> Brianna Labuskes is a master at dark psychological thrillers. Not only does she blend in elements of family drama and procedural, but her characters are always complex—a complexity that makes you both scared for them and scared of them. Case in point: Dr. Gretchen White, a police consultant who also happens to be a sociopath. Gretchen finds her friend Lena Booker, a renowned lawyer, dead after a fatal overdose. In the last minutes of her life, Lena leaves Gretchen a voice mail telling her that her client Viola Kent is innocent. Viola Kent, a thirteen-year-old budding psychopath, is accused of killing her mother. It seems like an open-and-shut case, but in Lena’s message, she says she messed up and needs Gretchen’s help to set things right. Gretchen has long been drawn to the case, as it echoes her own history. As a child, she was the prime suspect in her aunt’s murder. Her name was cleared, but she’d never been able to shake others’ suspicions. A Familiar Sight is an incredible start to a series featuring Dr. White. My head was spinning as I tried to figure out if Gretchen was actually a murderer, or if she was just dealt a bad hand. But sometimes the best characters are those who are neither good nor bad. Sometimes they just do what’s necessary to survive. </p>
<p> Book Club Fiction </p>
<p> What’s a good wedding without a little—okay, a lot of—drama? In Liz Parker’s juicy debut novel, two WASPy families pack a hefty dose of secrets alongside their formal wear for a destination wedding. And in the bright Bermuda sunshine, there are no shadows to keep those secrets from coming into the light. All Tiny McAllister wants is to marry the woman she loves, Caroline, surrounded by their close family and friends. With everyone together at an upscale beach resort, it promises to be a beautiful weekend of love and laughter. But the small group in attendance has big secrets, and things start to get murky as the truths pour out with the unexpected torrential rain. Will Tiny get the happily-ever-after she always dreamed about but never thought was possible for her? Or will it be washed away with the storm? Fans of Emma Straub and Laura Dave, get ready to spend a (very long) weekend with two new dysfunctional families as they learn hard lessons about acceptance, love, truth, and the meaning of family. </p>
<p> Memoir </p>
<p> Royd Tolkien is one of those people who you know is full of brilliant stories as soon as you meet him—his huge smile, genuine warmth, and larger-than-life personality are sure giveaways that this man has truly lived and can tell you all about it. I have no doubt that this innate storytelling ability is in part inherited from his great-grandfather J. R. R. Tolkien, but There’s a Hole in My Bucket is no fantasy novel—it is a memoir about a part of Royd’s life that is very real. When his brother sadly passed away, Mike’s last wishes sent Royd on an incredible journey of discovery and adventure. It is with great strength and generosity that Royd chose to share his journey through grief, and the moment I opened the first page, I was bowled over by this uplifting book, that a story with such sadness at its core was so full of joy and life and (surprisingly) laughter. Mike’s bucket list of activities for Royd ranges from the heartfelt (revisiting places special to their family) to the hilarious (dressing as Gandalf and blocking tourists’ walking routes, shouting, “You shall not pass”)—but each task gives you a peek behind the curtain at the depth and feeling of the bond between these two very different brothers. Royd has so eloquently explored his journey through grief, aided by Mike’s bucket list, and it is a book full to the brim with warmth and kindness. This memoir left me feeling hopeful and ultimately grateful for the power of family and love. It is a story I will treasure for years to come, as I hope you will. </p>
<p> Women's Fiction </p>
<p> If you were to make a list of your biggest regrets, how many of those regrets would involve relationships that went sideways? Amelia Montgomery, the heroine at the center of this heartfelt novel, can relate—she’s burned a few bridges in her day. But if there’s anything Amelia can teach us, it’s that it’s never too late for a second chance. Amelia’s world is flipped upside down when she’s forced out of her job at a prestigious law firm. Without work, she realizes her life is a little...lacking. She’s single with few interests, but what hits hardest is that Amelia has no meaningful relationships aside from her sister and parents. Amelia realizes something has to change and so she embarks on what she calls the Apology Project, reconnecting with the people she’s crossed in the past. This makes for some very hilarious encounters, yet it also helps Amelia see where she’s gone wrong and the person she’d like to be. She connects with her family roots after a 23andMe test reveals surprising results. She opens herself up to love—something Amelia’s never allowed herself to do. She makes amends but also recognizes there’s one thing she’ll never apologize for: being a strong woman. The Apology Project has all the makings of a perfect book club read. It’s timely, conversation-starting, and author Jeanette Escudero’s writing is so snappy and fun you’ll be hard-pressed to put these pages down. And then there’s Amelia, a refreshingly real character whose mistakes and vulnerabilities make her all the more relatable. Through Amelia, we see it’s possible to rebuild your life even when it seems impossible, and to do so in a way that feels authentic and true to you. Any other way, and you might regret it. </p>
<p> International Espionage </p>
<p> Set in Venezuela under the charismatic, larger-than-life leader Hugo Chávez, this steamy spy thriller is a delightful way to visit a fateful and fascinating time in the beautiful, troubled South American country. The author, Moisés Naím, is (among many other things) a former Venezuelan trade minister, celebrated author, and economics expert who is known around the world for the many nonfiction books and articles about politics and power he has written over the last three decades. Now, in his first novel, he uses all his experience and knowledge about how authoritarian governments work to write an unputdownable and atmospheric story full of exciting, complex, and colorful characters. Some of the characters are made up, like the rival spies and intrepid reporter who end up in a complicated love triangle; some are inspired by real people, like Prán, the mafia boss who runs a successful black-market business out of prison. And then there is Hugo Chávez himself—an unforgettable and intriguing character whom we get to know very well. The two spies—an American woman and a Cuban man—are the heart of the story. They spend much of the book hurtling toward each other inevitably and unknowingly, like a meteor headed for Earth, both nursing wounds they have accumulated over the course of their thrilling but soul-deadening careers, even while inflicting new ones on themselves and those around them. Though we know how this story ends for Chávez and his ravaged nation, if there is any hope for the two spies to have a happy ending, it lies in their potential to let go of Venezuela and heal themselves and each other. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! </p>
<p> Children's Picture Book </p>
<p> The first day of school is fast approaching, and Turkey couldn’t be more excited...until he learns that animals aren’t allowed at school. That’s when he realizes he needs a plan. With nearby props and the help of his barnyard pals, he creates some clever disguises, but it turns out it’s hard to outsmart kids and teachers. Luckily he has one more trick up his sleeve. Turkey’s antics, creative costumes, and a pun-filled story are a great way to help get kids excited about going back to school. While this is the fifth book in the popular Turkey Trouble series, little ones don’t have to have read the others to have a gobbledy-good time with this one. </p>

<doc id="file21597326" filename="reading-pages" parent_folder="web1" url="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/reading-pages">
<p> Reading Pages </p>
<p> The I/O from an instance of the SQL Server Database Engine includes logical and physical reads. A logical read occurs every time the Database Engine requests a page from the buffer cache. If the page is not currently in the buffer cache, a physical read first copies the page from disk into the cache. </p>
<p> The read requests generated by an instance of the Database Engine are controlled by the relational engine and optimized by the storage engine. The relational engine determines the most effective access method (such as a table scan, an index scan, or a keyed read); the access methods and buffer manager components of the storage engine determine the general pattern of reads to perform, and optimize the reads required to implement the access method. The thread executing the batch schedules the reads. </p>
<p> Read-Ahead </p>
<p> The Database Engine supports a performance optimization mechanism called read-ahead. Read-ahead anticipates the data and index pages needed to fulfill a query execution plan and brings the pages into the buffer cache before they are actually used by the query. This allows computation and I/O to overlap, taking full advantage of both the CPU and the disk. </p>
<p> The read-ahead mechanism allows the Database Engine to read up to 64 contiguous pages (512KB) from one file. The read is performed as a single scatter-gather read to the appropriate number of (probably non-contiguous) buffers in the buffer cache. If any of the pages in the range are already present in the buffer cache, the corresponding page from the read will be discarded when the read completes. The range of pages may also be "trimmed" from either end if the corresponding pages are already present in the cache. </p>
<p> There are two kinds of read-ahead: one for data pages and one for index pages. </p>
<p> Reading Data Pages </p>
<p> Table scans used to read data pages are very efficient in the Database Engine. The index allocation map (IAM) pages in a SQL Server database list the extents used by a table or index. The storage engine can read the IAM to build a sorted list of the disk addresses that must be read. This allows the storage engine to optimize its I/Os as large sequential reads that are performed in sequence, based on their location on the disk. For more information about IAM pages, see Managing Space Used by Objects. </p>
<p> Reading Index Pages </p>
<p> The storage engine reads index pages serially in key order. For example, this illustration shows a simplified representation of a set of leaf pages that contains a set of keys and the intermediate index node mapping the leaf pages. For more information about the structure of pages in an index, see Clustered Index Structures. </p>
<p> The storage engine uses the information in the intermediate index page above the leaf level to schedule serial read-aheads for the pages that contain the keys. If a request is made for all the keys from ABC to DEF, the storage engine first reads the index page above the leaf page. However, it does not just read each data page in sequence from page 504 to page 556 (the last page with keys in the specified range). Instead, the storage engine scans the intermediate index page and builds a list of the leaf pages that must be read. The storage engine then schedules all the reads in key order. The storage engine also recognizes that pages 504/505 and 527/528 are contiguous and performs a single scatter read to retrieve the adjacent pages in a single operation. When there are many pages to be retrieved in a serial operation, the storage engine schedules a block of reads at a time. When a subset of these reads is completed, the storage engine schedules an equal number of new reads until all the required reads have been scheduled. </p>
<p> The storage engine uses prefetching to speed base table lookups from nonclustered indexes. The leaf rows of a nonclustered index contain pointers to the data rows that contain each specific key value. As the storage engine reads through the leaf pages of the nonclustered index, it also starts scheduling asynchronous reads for the data rows whose pointers have already been retrieved. This allows the storage engine to retrieve data rows from the underlying table before it has completed the scan of the nonclustered index. Prefetching is used regardless of whether the table has a clustered index. SQL Server Enterprise uses more prefetching than other editions of SQL Server, allowing more pages to be read ahead. The level of prefetching is not configurable in any edition. For more information about nonclustered indexes, see Nonclustered Index Structures. </p>
<p> Advanced Scanning </p>
<p> In SQL Server Enterprise, the advanced scan feature allows multiple tasks to share full table scans. If the execution plan of a Transact-SQL statement requires a scan of the data pages in a table and the Database Engine detects that the table is already being scanned for another execution plan, the Database Engine joins the second scan to the first, at the current location of the second scan. The Database Engine reads each page one time and passes the rows from each page to both execution plans. This continues until the end of the table is reached. </p>
<p> At that point, the first execution plan has the complete results of a scan, but the second execution plan must still retrieve the data pages that were read before it joined the in-progress scan. The scan for the second execution plan then wraps back to the first data page of the table and scans forward to where it joined the first scan. Any number of scans can be combined like this. The Database Engine will keep looping through the data pages until it has completed all the scans. This mechanism is also called "merry-go-round scanning" and demonstrates why the order of the results returned from a SELECT statement cannot be guaranteed without an ORDER BY clause. </p>
<p> For example, assume that you have a table with 500,000 pages. UserA executes a Transact-SQL statement that requires a scan of the table. When that scan has processed 100,000 pages, UserB executes another Transact-SQL statement that scans the same table. The Database Engine schedules one set of read requests for pages after 100,001, and passes the rows from each page back to both scans. When the scan reaches the 200,000th page, UserC executes another Transact-SQL statement that scans the same table. Starting with page 200,001, the Database Engine passes the rows from each page it reads back to all three scans. After it reads the 500,000th row, the scan for UserA is complete, and the scans for UserB and UserC wrap back and start to read the pages starting with page 1. When the Database Engine gets to page 100,000, the scan for UserB is completed. The scan for UserC then keeps going alone until it reads page 200,000. At this point, all the scans have been completed. </p>
<p> Without advanced scanning, each user would have to compete for buffer space and cause disk arm contention. The same pages would then be read once for each user, instead of read one time and shared by multiple users, slowing down performance and taxing resources. </p>

<p> Welcome </p>
<p> Welcome to Sam Reads What, a book review blog intended to inspire reading and provoke thought. Sam Reads What is my cozy corner of the internet where I read and review books. This book review blog is meant to be a place for you to enjoy a cup of coffee while simultaneously deciding which book to read next. </p>
<p> I’m Sam, the book nerd behind this book review blog. Here you will find bi-weekly book reviews and various other book related posts- those can be found on the Sam Reads page. </p>
<p> If you want to know more about me, the book blogger, go ahead and read my About Me page. </p>
<p> Go to my Contact Me page if you want to recommend a book or an author, or reach out if you have a book you want me to review. </p>
<p> I’m an avid reader, a female author enthusiast, a Harry Potter lover, and I am adding my voice to the conversations around books. </p>

<p> Fallon’s father absolutely does NOT support her choice to leave Los Angeles and pursue her acting dreams in New York City.

Fallon has … </p>
<p> Helen Berner is born and raised in the Florida Keys but has always longed to escape, especially as of late since she’s heavily pregnant with her abusive husbands child. Mirta Perez finds herself in the Florida Keys on her honeymoon with a husband she was arranged to marry and hardly knows. Mirta can’t ignore her … </p>
<p> About </p>
<p> Hello and welcome to Sam Reads What. I hope you find yourself here because you too love books. (If not, I hope to change that.) </p>
<p> I have never had somewhere outside of my own head to talk about and appreciate books, so I have created a book review blog for fellow readers to devour story after story through reading and reviewing books with me. </p>
<p> I will give my honest thoughts and opinions on books that I read, and my hope is for you to read my book reviews and be inspired to pick up a book because of them. </p>
<p> I want you to feel a sense of companionship when we feel the same way about a character. I want you to gain a new perspective on a theme you were unsure about. I want Sam Reads What to keep you company during your morning coffee, and your evening wine. </p>
<p> No two people read one book the same way. Certain themes will speak to you more than others, specific characters will resonate with you and not me, which is why reading is a personal experience. In reviewing books, my goal is to share my experience with you and create an atmosphere for reading to also become a social experience. </p>
<p> Right now our world centers around streaming services and social media, and reading has become a forgotten pastime. My mission is to encourage you to immerse yourself in a Megan Miranda thriller over binge watching the latest true crime documentary. Be consumed by Becoming by Michelle Obama instead of the Bachelor franchise. </p>
<p> Sam Reads What is meant to be a cozy spot on the Internet to inspire reading and writing. </p>
<p> Now that you know what we are doing here, I will tell you a little about myself. </p>
<p> I grew up with a book and a pen in my hand; when I wasn’t reading, I was writing. </p>
<p> I know how cliche this sounds but reading is my escape. I get lost in other people’s stories. Sometimes too lost when suddenly it’s 3am and I work in a few short hours but I digress. </p>
<p> Any time you find yourself in a reading lull, I always recommend you reread Harry Potter to get the magic back. And, good romance novels will help get you through your early 20’s. </p>
<p> I like to follow along with Reese’s Book Club and anything that Kristen Ashley writes. I don’t discriminate between fiction and nonfiction, romance or thriller, historical or fantasy. I read it all. </p>
<p> I’ve laughed out loud while reading, I’ve cried with characters and I’ve slept with the lights on after a particularly terrifying thriller. I hope books can do the same things to you. </p>
<p> Follow along on Instagram (@samreadswhat) and tell me what you’re reading. Then head over to my Sam Reads page to catch up on my reviews and pick your next book. </p>
<p> Happy reading everybody! </p>
<p> Contact Me </p>

<p> What users say about our products </p>
<p> “As a parent of a struggling Middle School student with Dyslexia, reading has always been a challenge. We use NaturalReader Software and the MP3 export feature almost daily to help him get through lengthy reading assignments. NaturalReader has been instrumental in helping him to excel in school!.” </p>
<p> - Mary Hardin </p>
<p> “I no longer strain my eyes trying to read tiny fonts in e-mails or web pages or spend time recording my own voice for teaching purposes. I have a "bilingual" NaturalReader and it has become a very useful tool. By the way, my students haven't noticed that my "friend" Kate, who reads lessons so nicely, is a computer..” </p>
<p> - Ariel Miranda </p>
<p> “As an assistive technology advocate for an Independent Living Center for Riverside County California, I think Nature Reader is a wonderful and affordable software for children with learning disability and dyslexia. I have cerebral palsy myself and this software has increased my productivity more than I had imagined. What I like the most about the software is the interface, because of my bad eyesight I had to increase the font, it makes reading more fun and pleasurable.” </p>
<p> - Chi-Hung Luke Hsieh </p>
<p> “This software helps me pronounce words that I cannot and it helps me avoid making grammatical errors when writing my case briefs and my essays. I enjoy the fact that I can convert my online textbooks into MP3’s and listen to them on my smart phone or while driving in my car. ” </p>
<p> - Danita Moses </p>
<p> “I use NaturalReader to read aloud passages from ebooks I have bought, PDF documents, webpages with lots of text, and to read back to me things I have typed to 'hear them'. This helps me greatly as although I am a visual/kinetic learner, words are not pictures. ” </p>
<p> - Ayla Duffton </p>
<p> “NaturalReader has been a transformational and liberating product for me. As someone that suffers from a learning disability, having this product to proof my emails, presentations and contracts, has allowed me to become more independent and not have the burden to rely on someone to proof my work. ” </p>

<p> Speed Reading Test Online </p>
<p> Is Speed Reading for You? </p>
<p> Are you an efficient reader? What kind of reader are you? </p>
<p> You will know in a few minutes after you have completed this free online speed reading test. </p>
<p> You will get your reading speed as soon as you have finished your timed reading. You may then perform a comprehension test with a series of questions about the text you have just read. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Get ready to read, click the Start button and start reading. The button starts the timer. Don't speed but read normally to find your present reading level. </p>
<p> Click the Stop button as soon as you have finished. This will stop the timer and display your reading speed. </p>
<p> Before you start the real test you may click Start, scroll down without reading, then click Stop to see what happens. You may also size the window of your browser to adjust column width. </p>
<p> Speed Reading Test </p>
<p> Reading is becoming more and more important in the new knowledge economy and remains the most effective human activity for transforming information into knowledge. </p>
<p> If top readers read at speeds of above 1000 words per minute (wpm) with near 85% comprehension, they only represent 1% of readers. Average readers are the majority and only reach around 200 wpm with a typical comprehension of 60%. This seems surprising since most readers, actively reading work documents, newspapers, magazines, books or the contents of a computer display are practicing daily for at least one hour. With such an intense training everyone should be close to top performances. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, this is far from the real situation. The average reader is five times slower than the good reader. Things are even worse if we consider reading efficiency as well as speed. Reading efficiency is reading speed weighted by comprehension rate and it amounts to 200 x 60% or 120 efficient words per minute (ewpm) for the average reader and to 1000 x 85% or 850 ewpm for top readers. Thus, an efficiency ratio of seven divides these two categories. </p>
<p> Compare the results of the average reader to other areas. We may imagine a sprinter practicing every day for several years on the running track and then just calmly walking for a race. We can also picture a racing driver never exceeding 30 mph or a pianist playing every day of the week for 20 years and only able to play music like a beginner. Unfortunately, since the age of 12, most readers do not substantially improve their efficiency and never reach their full capacity. </p>
<p> Every computer-user who is also a slow typist is aware of the benefits he could obtain with a typing course, but nearly no one suspects the much higher profits he could reach by improving his reading comprehension and speed. The rapid improvement of voice recognition may gradually make typing virtuosity obsolete since a good typist performs well under the speed of speech. On the other hand, human or computer speaking, with an average speed of 150 wpm, will always remain many times slower than a good reader, without any consideration of the skimming and skipping possibilities. </p>
<p> There are three possible ways to improve reading. The fastest is probably a speed reading seminar based upon good materials and animated by a dynamic instructor. It is quite usual for a slow reader to double and even triple his reading efficiency during a two-day class offering a positive atmosphere, carefully selected texts and comprehension tests. However, as this rapid and encouraging improvement is not sufficiently anchored, it often fades with time. </p>
<p> A book about speed reading is the second possibility. Such a book usually provides speed and comprehension tests as well as techniques to improve reading. It often includes more general information about concentration, interest stimulation, skimming techniques and ways to approach a text. Some methods may include audio or videocassettes. A book-based method requires a good deal of time as well as a strong commitment from the reader. </p>
<p> Finally, a speed reading computer program is probably the most efficient way to achieve top reading levels. Computers offer unique exercises to boost reading efficiency through interactivity, text animation and pacing. Higher reading skills obtained with a computer screen are totally transferable to reading from paper. Unfortunately the inverse way does not work so well. Speed reading software delivers enjoyable and fast paced training, thus giving the consistent practice necessary to break lifelong slow reading habits. This is the task that seminars and speed reading books usually leave up to the reader. </p>
<p> Speed reading results </p>
<p> You read at words per minute. </p>
<p> Write down or remember your reading speed. Now answer some questions about the previous text to perform your comprehension test. </p>
<p> If you really think it is impossible to do better, that is, to both read faster and improve your reading comprehension, then redo the speed reading test. </p>
<p> Typical reading results </p>
<p> Measurements of speed and comprehension depend upon the text contents and upon a set of questions. Results in the table do not correspond to a specific test but give a general idea of reading efficiencies. </p>
<p> Research shows that reading is around 25% slower from a computer screen than from paper. This difference generally increases with increasing reading speed. Thus you may slightly increase your results to find your speed when reading from paper. </p>
<p> Reader profiles </p>
<p> 110 wpm, slow reader, but you have many possibilities for improvement. FReader will provide rapid comprehension and speed increases. You will soon realize that reading can be a pleasure. FReader will give you hours of instructions and training so that you keep improving up to top level reading performances. </p>
<p> 240 wpm, oral reader. You may rapidly and significantly progress by suppressing subvocalization. FReader software is perfect for you. </p>
<p> 400 wpm, auditory reader. FReader provides several speed reading modes to pace your reading beyond this sound barrier of 400 wpm. </p>
<p> 1000 wpm, visual reader. Your reading speed is the gem of your CV. You don't need FReader but it could certainly be useful to members of your family, who are not such accomplished readers. </p>
