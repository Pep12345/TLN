<p> Goodreads Top 100 Stage Plays of All Time </p>
<p> The list of recommendations of the "Top 100 Stage Plays of All Time" originates from the Serious Literature Group of Goodreads. </p>
<p> Score </p>
<p> A book’s total score is based on multiple factors, including the number of people who have voted for it and how highly those voters ranked the book. </p>

<p> Sorry for the duplication of "R&J", the 100th play should be "Coriolanus" by Shakespeare. </p>
<p> OK, I have combined duplicates about five times and it won't stick. CJ, could you remove the one with the portrait of William Shakespeare on it, which is the duplicate? </p>
<p> I take it this is a DO NOT ADD BOOKS TO THIS LIST type of list, only if it doesn't say that up top you know what'll happen </p>

<p> :O)" </p>
<p> Good point. You might want to consider if you want to add that notice, David. </p>
<p> Dear CR, No worries. It's a very fine play. The challenge for our Serious Literature Group was not to add every Shakespeare play but rather to give a chance to a broad array of worthy playwrights. </p>
<p> #96 and #98 both are Gorky, and list the same play, The Lower Depths, although one is an anthology. </p>
<p> Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie is superior to any other Williams play and a good many on this list. Just saying. </p>
<p> If you can't think of 100 better plays than ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD, you need to think harder. </p>
<p> Do you think the "outliers" can't hear you? This is listopia. Make a shelf if you want it private. </p>
<p> I'm merely asking the list creator, who wanted a closed list, if he wanted that respected or not. </p>
<p> I doubt the outliers can hear me; they are plays. Which didn't have ears, the last time I checked. </p>

<p> A list maker isn't allowed to create the "rules of the game" because this is listopia??? </p>

<p> Dear Goodreaders, This list has been open for discussion for nearly four weeks by the Serious Literature Group of Goodreads, which has also recently published Top 100 lists on literary novels and poems. This group is comprised of a highly diverse group of Goodreaders. I have agreed to publish the consensus of our group. The purpose of this list is to promote discussion about great stage plays. I'm glad to see that you have strong opinions and favorites as they will help to point readers to Goodreads. Please vote for your favorites and voice your agreement or disagreement with the list. There were so many great plays it was a challenge to identify only 100 -- Shakespeare properly occupies a significant section of the list and a strong argument could well be made that every one of his plays should be on this top 100 list. I don't agree with all the selections myself and haven't read all of them. Nevertheless, I do plan to indulge in reading and seeing new stage plays from this list. So please keep your comments coming on this list and feel free to build your own on Listopia: that's why it's there for you. </p>
<p> Thank you for explaining the purpose of this list and the process that led to its creation. </p>
<p> My own list of the top 100 stage plays would not match this list, but I realize that this list is not an invitation to the entire GR community to turn the list into an unlimited number of "top" plays. I hope that your message (#23) will encourage GR members to vote only for works on the Serious Literature Group's list and discourage voters from attempting to make the list something other than it was meant to be. </p>
<p> Dear Susanna, Yes, please -- Chaucer's "Miller's Tale" from the Canterbury Tales is not a stage play, for example, but appears in our Top 100 Poems List and does belong there as it is great. But Mel Brooks in the Top 100 Stage Plays of All Time? Or Neil Simon, really? "The Frogs" by Aristophenes is on our group's original list and should stay. A few of the other adds are quite interesting and I wish we had them earlier. Thank you for your help, Susanna. </p>
<p> David, I'm, of course, not among those who have voted for plays that are not on the Serious Literature Group's list; and I think that the members who voted for a few of Neil Simon's plays did not select his best works. But in response to your comment in message #26, I want to say: "No Neil Simon, really?" </p>
<p> The Serious Literature Group may well be guilty off being a little too serious. I'm loving your repartee. </p>
<p> David wrote: "The Serious Literature Group may well be guilty off being a little too serious. </p>
<p> You took the words right out of my mind. Seriously. Thank you -- seriously. </p>
<p> I love the list; thank you for making this! And I'm for Coriolanus haha! However, I think Peter Pan should be added as the greatest piece of children's theatre. Also, I think the time is ripe to re-evaluate Ibsen. A Doll's House and The Master Builder, as utterly excellent as they are, are more period pieces. Although they still work very well on stage, they were specific to controversies of the day. An Enemy of the People is so well done, its relevance can still rile and enlighten audiences far better than plays being written about current affairs. Also, Peer Gynt has become a more and more relevant play as theatre techniques have evolved. Both plays were hugely impactful on contemporary playwrights such as Arthur Miller. The plays that made Ibsen iconic may no longer be his best works, now that we can see them from a distance. </p>

<p> Dear Colin, I think that Tayyab is building a children's book top 100 list on which "Peter Pan" rightfully belongs. I totally get your point on Ibsen and agree with it. He did have a great influence on theatre in his day and thereafter but some may pale as period pieces. Thank you for your insight and sharp perspective. </p>

<p> CORIOLANUS -- serio..." </p>
<p> There's just no accounting for taste, Reese. I mean, Shakespeare? Seriously? </p>
<p> I have enjoyed reading the comments posted by each of you. And Colin, I'm with you on the place that AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE deserves to get before spots are given to ADH and TMB. I have an imagination deficiency, so I can't imagine what it would take to get me to support the inclusion of CORIOLANUS on a list of the top 100 stage plays "of all time." </p>
<p> David wrote: "Dear Reese, This ship has sailed after four weeks of serious discussion about what should be on the list: the list is the list. I encourage you to start your own list -- honestly. I have voluntaril..." </p>
<p> David, </p>
<p> I believe that you may have misunderstood my intention. In responding to Colin's comments, I was simply engaging in an exchange of opinions. Your remarks in message #23 seemed to encourage discussion of the list. I wasn't attempting to get the Group to modify the list, nor am I interested in starting a new list. The site has a Best Plays or Musicals list and a Best American Plays list, and I've already voted for works on both lists. </p>
<p> Haha Coriolanus is a strange play that always seems to be making a comeback. It's raw and has essentially no likeable characters, keeping it from ever become a mainstream staple,but the very real, pulsating arguments and fascinating character portrayal always spark the minds of deep Shakespeare diggers, the way something like All's Well that Ends Well does not.Olivier had massive success with it, T.S. Eliot called it Shakespeare's best tragedy, and now it's a gold star for Ralph Fienes both on stage and screen. I call it the great underdog play. </p>
<p> Colin wrote: "Haha Coriolanus is a strange play that always seems to be making a comeback. It's raw and has essentially no likeable characters, keeping it from ever become a mainstream staple,but the very real, ..." </p>

<p> Colin, I have to admit that your passionate remarks about CORIOLANUS have shaken the scale in my head that, for many years, has had almost nothing but tedious scholarly articles sitting on it. I should see Ralph Fienes and forget "The Dialectic of Transcendence in CORIOLANUS" etc. Thanks for sharing your knowledge and experience. </p>
<p> Let's open this excellent list to gain the benefit of the intellectual capital of all Goodreaders based upon our list of Top 100 Stage Plays recommended by the Serious Literature Group. I'll take off the "Please Do Not Add Books" notation and see where this accessibility takes our list. </p>
<p> Importance of Being Earnest #3? I read a play the other night called MURDER WITH GRACE that was as good as Wilde's overrated play. </p>
<p> I've done some community theater and so I got to add some of these to my read list on GoodReads. My favorite part out of the plays listed was the Professor in Our Town - " We have some of the oldest dirt in the world here. We're very proud of that. " </p>
<p> Dear Julie, Yes, we opened up the list to everyone after a while. Feel free to make additions as long as they're great stage plays. Love "Faust": Part I is already there at #20. Cordially, David </p>
<p> Hm... can it be I haven't read enough plays? or is that I've forgotten that many? </p>
<p> Surely an indication of how great a play is would be how often it is performed regardless of age? The best of the Shakespeare canon is continuously performed worldwide. 'Antigone' despite being over three thousand years old can still be seen in the original or as Seamus Heaney's re-working of it in many a theatres repertoire. But Aristophanes 'The Frogs' ? Really? When was the last time anyone actually saw a performance of The Frogs? It may still be studied in Classics/Literature classes, but a play is meant to be watched not just read.The test of a great play is in performance and The Frogs doesn't hold up. For that reason I think Neil Simon,who was somewhat maligned here, would be a better choice than Aristophanes. Come on admit it, you'd rather watch Brighton Beach Memoirs any day :D Viv 'The Frivolous Literature Group' </p>

<p> I have to disagree with regards to A Doll's House I have just seen The Young Vic's production of A Doll's House with a new translation by Simon Stephens and both my friend and I were surprised at how relevant the play still is, even to a modern audience. Coriolanus gets my vote, there is going to be a great new production at The Donmar in November, the hottest ticket in London this year! </p>
<p> Thanks for the top 100 stage plays. I have English Literature Exam in India. I have to read all these stories now to crack the exam. Thanks for your help From Shyam Reddy http://readwritelistenspeak.com/meton... I will be coming back to read this stuff again and again. </p>

<p> 5 Ways To Play Hard To Get That Will Actually Work </p>
<p> Playing hard to get may seem pointless, but it's not. When done correctly, it gives the relationship a bit of extra excitement. </p>
<p> The problem with playing hard to get is that it backfires sometimes. Whoever was playing hard to get was playing wrong, playing too hard to get. It's a fine, fuzzy line. </p>
<p> Everyone has different limits, expectations and definitions of love. When you play hard to get, take into account the other person. After all, you are interested in them, no? </p>
<p> You're going to want to play the game carefully. Remember, as much as this is for you, it's also for your crush. Here's how to do it effectively. </p>
<p> 1. Give the attention he or she needs, but not the attention he or she wants. </p>
<p> Just as people have limits as far as how much they can handle, they also have minimums as far as how little they're willing to accept. You have to get into your crush's head to figure out how much attention is too much. </p>
<p> When does it cross over? When your crush no longer feels like he or she needs to work for your attention. Not that your crush ought to be constantly working for your attention, but he or she needs to be giving a little bit. </p>
<p> And be careful about not giving your crush enough attention -- if he or she doesn't feel that you care, he or she will call it quits. </p>
<p> 2. Make your crush work for it, but don't forget to put in some effort yourself. </p>
<p> You want the person you're dating to always be making an effort. </p>
<p> This isn't to say your crush must always be on his or her toes, always making sure to give you attention and feeling like they're always putting in an enormous amount of effort. That's exhausting. But you do want him or her to feel like he or she should always make an effort. You want your crush to want to always make an effort. </p>
<p> Playing hard to get is a game, one played by two people. You want the other person to work for you, just as you want him or her to make you work for him or her. </p>
<p> Nothing extreme, of course, just a nice bit of tension to keep things exciting. You have to realize making someone want to work to get you is synonymous with making him or her want you. </p>
<p> 3. Make him or her wait for sex. </p>
<p> Yes, you have a penis and/or a vagina, and you know how to use it. Good for you. That in itself isn't enough to tell you it's time to get your freak on. Sex is wonderful, but as all wonderful things, it becomes more wonderful when we have time to let the anticipation grow. </p>
<p> Again, you don't want to wait too long because anticipation can kill you. Or, at the very least, kill the relationship. If you haven't had sex yet, then giving it some time -- time to get to know each other on a deeper level -- will make the sex that much better. </p>
<p> If you've been having sex, don't make it part of the routine. Sex shouldn't be routine. It should be spontaneous. Routines, no matter what they consist of, inevitably become boring. </p>
<p> 4. Open the window, but don't let him or her jump through. </p>
<p> You should always be careful with whom you let in. Not all people deserve to get to know you on an intimate level. </p>
<p> Instead of laying your hand on the table, show your crush one card at a time. Pull back the curtains, even open the window, but don't let him or her leap until it's time. </p>
<p> Think about it this way: If your goal is to find someone to spend your life with, then you should approach each relationship as if it has the potential to become what you're looking for (if it doesn't have the potential of becoming what you want it to become, then you shouldn't be in the relationship in the first place). </p>
<p> And considering you have a lifetime, take your time. Get to know each other slowly. Don't rush this process, because it's more fun not to. </p>
<p> 5. Give him or her affection, but always take your space. </p>
<p> Relationships are often disappointing because people in the relationship are aiming for something impossible. </p>
<p> I know that you want the two of you to become one, but that will never actually happen. You two will always be separate individuals. So let this person be themselves, and let you be you. Do your own things, and then do the rest together. </p>
<p> The beauty of spending time apart is that it regularly reminds you how important the other person is to you. It allows you to miss this person. </p>
<p> The truth is that you can't miss someone who's always there -- and you want this person to miss you. Spend enough time apart to ensure the time you have together is as exciting, intense and magical as it should be. </p>

<p> With the Google Play Store app, download apps and games for your Android phone or tablet. The Play Store also serves as an entertainment hub, letting you buy or rent movies, TV shows, books, and music, which you can watch or listen to on your Android device, Chromecast-connected TV, and through the Chrome browser on your Mac or Windows PC. </p>
<p> Pros </p>
<p> Protects device by vetting apps: Google uses in-store and on-device monitoring to guard against harmful apps. Google claims only 0.05 percent of Android devices that download apps solely from its Play Store have a potentially harmful app. </p>
<p> The app also includes Google Play Protect, which periodically scans your device for potentially harmful apps and checks apps before you download them from the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Listen to music for free or with a subscription: Google Play Music offers a competitive alternative to other music services, such as Spotify and Apple Music with personalized playlists and radio stations, podcasts, albums, and individual song tracks you can listen to for free or with a subscription. (Some of the personalization comes from Google's Songza purchase.) A $9.99 monthly individual subscription gives you unlimited skips and an ad-free music stream. And Google seems to be constantly offering a multi-month free trial of Play Music, so you can try it out for free for a few months to see if you like it before paying for it. </p>
<p> Watch movies and TV shows: Again, going toe-to-toe with video store competitors Apple and Amazon, Google's Play Movies & TV store lets you purchase or rent films and shows you can watch on your Android phone, computer, or Chromecast-connected TV. You can choose either SD or HD formats (priced accordingly). </p>
<p> Share with the family: Through Google's Play Store's Family Library, you can share eligible apps, films, TV shows, games, and eBooks with up to five members of your family. </p>
<p> Shop in Google Play through a desktop browser: Of course, you can shop in the Play Store with the Android app, but you can also browse and buy apps and media and manage your account via a browser. Using the browser version is handy, letting you quickly manage your account, view your order history, and find and install new apps. Unfortunately, to check for and install updates, you need to use the app. (If you can't find Google's Play Store on your Android phone, check out our guide for how to locate and enable it.) </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> Google's hands-off approach to apps: While Google talks up security, it seems less concerned about the quality of apps it lets in its store. Popular apps attract copycats -- with deceptively similar names and icons -- and picking out the original among the fakes can be tough. </p>
<p> Google Music not included in Family Sharing: Play Music is not part of the Google Play family plan. To share music with five family members, you need a separate $14.99 per month music subscription. </p>
<p> Google Play Protect not up to the task: The independent security testing firm AV-Test found Play Protect lagged far behind the top Android antivirus in detecting malware and noted that those relying only on Play Protect to guard their phone are taking an unnecessary risk. </p>
<p> Bottom Line </p>
<p> The official Android app store, Google Play also serves as storefront for music, movies, TV shows, eBooks, and magazines. Google Play is bursting with apps, and the company's hands-off approach to policing copycat apps can, at times, make finding the true apps among knockoffs a challenge. </p>

<p> Entertainment is supposed to be fun. But in reality, getting everything to work can be the exact opposite -- moving files between your computers, endless syncing across your devices, and wires... lots of wires. Today we're eliminating all that hassle with Google Play Store, a digital entertainment destination where you can find, enjoy and share your favorite music, movies, books and apps on the web and on your Android phone or tablet. Google Play Store is entirely cloud-based so all your music, movies, books and apps are stored online, always available to you, and you never have to worry about losing them or moving them again. </p>

<p> The Toddler Years: What Is Associative Play? </p>
<p> As your little one grows, playing side-by-side and with other children will become a big part of their world. </p>
<p> While it can be hard to realize you’re no longer their everything — though don’t worry, you’re still the center of their universe for a while longer — this is a great stage in play development. </p>
<p> Your kiddo will play with others on the playground, at playgroups, at social events, at preschool — you name it. If there are other children around, precious playtime shenanigans can ensue. And that means you can stop being the number one source of entertainment (for now). </p>
<p> This is sometimes called associative play by child development experts. It’s a stage of development when preschool-aged children start to play with or next to other kids doing similar activities. You and I might not necessary call it playing with others, but it’s a big step all the same. </p>
<p> During associative play, toddlers start to take an interest in the other children and what they’re doing. That doesn’t mean they all come together for formal play with agreed-upon activity guidelines or even a common goal — but hey, even adults may find such coordination difficult! </p>
<p> Rather, kids at this stage — usually starting around ages 2–4 — are widening their play world to include others. </p>
<p> There are lots of child development models, so keep in mind that this is just one of them. </p>
<p> An American sociologist named Mildred Parten Newhall created the six stages of play. Associative play is considered the fifth of the six stages. </p>
<p> Here are the others, if you’re keeping track: </p>
<p> Unoccupied play. A child is just observing, not playing. They start to look around and observe the world around them, but not necessarily the people in it. </p>
<p> Solitary play. A child plays alone without any interest in interacting with others. </p>
<p> Onlooker play. The child is observing others nearby, but not playing together with them. </p>
<p> Parallel play. A child plays or does the same activity as others around them at the same time, but may not interact with them. </p>
<p> Associative play. A child plays side-by-side with others, engaging at times but not coordinating efforts. </p>
<p> Cooperative play. The child plays with others while interacting with them and is interested in both them and the activity. </p>
<p> Parallel and associative play are a lot alike. But during parallel play, your child is playing next to another child, but isn’t talking to them or engaging with them. </p>
<p> During associative play, a child begins to focus on the other person playing, and not just on their own play. Two children at this stage may talk and start to interact with one another. And yes, it’s pretty cute when this happens — the stuff viral YouTube videos are made of. </p>
<p> Your child may start associative play when they’re 3 or 4 years old, or as early as 2. This stage of play usually lasts until they’re around 4 or 5 years old, though children will continue to play this way at times even after entering the next stage of play. </p>
<p> But remember, every child develops at their own pace. Some solitary play is perfectly OK for preschool-aged children. In fact, it’s an important skill! </p>
<p> But if your child is playing by themselves all the time, you may want to encourage them to start to interact and share with others — also a crucial skill. </p>
<p> You can help encourage them by being the one to play with them first, but allow them to run the playtime show. You can then show them sharing and interacting skills by doing it yourself! </p>
<p> If you’re concerned about your child’s development, chat with an expert like their pediatrician or a teacher. They can recommend a specialist, if needed. </p>
<p> Outside, kids ride tricycles next to one another but don’t have a coordinated plan of where they’re going. </p>
<p> At preschool, children build a tower out of blocks but don’t have a formal plan or any organization. </p>
<p> After school, kids paint a canvas together using the same materials but don’t communicate to create a unified picture or necessarily comment on what others are drawing. </p>
<p> One toddler plays with a toy and your child joins them and copies what they’re doing. They may chat, but they don’t make a formal plan together or set any rules. </p>
<p> This is a great stage for benefits that follow your little one all the way into adulthood. These include: </p>
<p> Problem solving and conflict resolution </p>
<p> As your child starts to play and interact with other children more, they’ll gain some important problem-solving and conflict resolution skills, research shows. </p>
<p> share </p>
<p> negotiate </p>
<p> Although you should always keep an eye on your child when they’re playing at such a young age, try to only interfere when absolutely necessary. (It’s hard, we know!) Instead, allow them to work out their own conflicts as much as possible as they start to play with others. </p>
<p> Cooperation </p>
<p> As your child plays with other kids, they’ll start to share toys and art supplies. This won’t always be painless — even adults don’t always share well! — but they’ll need to learn cooperation as they recognize that some things belong to others. </p>
<p> Healthy brain development </p>
<p> Associative play — and sometimes all play in general — is important for your child’s brain. It allows them to use their imagination as they create and explore the world around them. </p>
<p> Research shows this helps your little one develop resiliency to face and overcome future challenges. Of course as parents, we want to clear every obstacle from our child’s path — but that’s neither possible nor helpful for the big stuff that lies ahead. </p>
<p> Learning readiness </p>
<p> It may not seem like it, but research shows that playtime gives your child the social-emotional readiness they need to get ready for an academic environment. That’s because they’re developing the skills needed for school like cognition, learning behaviors, and problem solving. </p>
<p> They’re also interacting with others, but not at the expense of others, an important skill your child will need in preschool and eventually, elementary school — and of course, beyond. </p>
<p> Reduce childhood obesity </p>
<p> Encourage your child to play with others and be active several times a week instead of spending time in front of a screen. This can help to build healthy, active bodies. (To be clear, learning can happen during screen time, too — just not this specific type of learning.) </p>
<p> Making plenty of time for play is essential for your child. They’re learning important skills like cooperation and problem solving. </p>
<p> While it’s OK for your preschool-aged child to play alone, you can also encourage them to play alongside others. </p>
<p> Some will take longer than others to get there. If you’re worried about their development or social skills, talk to their pediatrician — a great ally who has likely seen it all and can make recommendations tailored to you. </p>

<p> The best free-to-play games for 2021 </p>
<p> The best free games offer players a lot of content without charging anything, with some ethical microtransactions for super-fans. We’ve rounded up the best free-to-play games that hold true to that, including free FPS games and MMORPGs. With everything from genre-bending games like Frog Fractions to open-world JRPGs like Genshin Impact, there’s something for everyone. </p>
<p> Although the free-to-play group gets a bad rap, there are plenty of games that offer dozens (and even hundreds) of hours of gameplay without asking for a dime. There are a few options on Xbox Series X and PS5, but most of the titles below are free PC games. Thankfully, quite a few of them are from a few years ago, so you should be able to run them without a full gaming PC. </p>
<p> Cheap isn’t necessarily free, but if you’re looking for steep discounts on consoles and accessories, take a look at the best gaming deals available now. </p>
<p> Runescape </p>
<p> Runescape is one of the most iconic free-to-play games there is, and 20 years after launch, it’s still going strong. Developer Jagex has continued to update the game over the past 20 years, offering literally thousands of hours of gameplay. If you haven’t played Runescape, it’s a high-fantasy MMORPG with varied weapon types and a long list of skills to master. Questing with friends is where Runescape is at its best, but you can also take things slow and hone your farming, fishing, and cooking skills. </p>
<p> Old School Runescape is available, too. It’s based on the 2007 build of Runescape that shot it into the limelight, featuring the same charming graphics, quests, bosses, and economy. Unlike the base game, Old School Runescape requires a monthly membership. However, you can share your membership across both versions of the game — it unlocks some exclusive skills and quests — and you can pay with either cash or Bonds that you can earn in-game. </p>
<p> Lord of the Rings Online </p>
<p> Amazon may have canceled its Lord of the Rings MMO, but there’s still Lord of the Rings Online. The game just passed its 14th anniversary, and it’s still receiving content updates. In Lord of the Rings Online, you create your own character to explore Middle-earth. You can outfit your characters in countless different ways, choosing between four races, nine classes, 10 professions, and more than 1,000 skills and traits. As you play, you can take part in solo or cooperative skirmishes and explorations to gather materials to craft new gear. </p>
<p> You can even play the role of a servant in Sauron’s army in PvMP encounters. All of that, and Lord of the Rings Online is completely free to play, no monthly fee required. Although you can play for free, the game has a VIP program that gives you access to more inventory slots, monthly points to use in the shop, and access to all quests, skirmishes, monster classes, and crafting guilds. </p>
<p> Phantasy Star Online 2 </p>
<p> Phantasy Star Online 2 released in 2012, but it didn’t come to the U.S. until 2020. You play as an ARKs operative, which is an elite group of fighters that explores dangerous planets looking for a dark corruption called the Falspawn. You can choose from several unique classes to take on quests, and after leveling up a bit, you can assign another class as a sub-class to inherit special abilities. </p>
<p> Instead of a unified world, Phantasy Star Online 2 focuses on quests. You can join a party appropriate for your level to take on small missions with a limited number of other players, allowing you to easily jump into the game without dedicating a few hours. On quests, you’ll earn random loot drops. These drops give you new combat skills to use with your weapon, aiding the passive skills you can unlock in the skill tree. </p>
<p> Although Phantasy Star Online 2 has some paid content, you can play through all of the story content for free. </p>
<p> Genshin Impact </p>
<p> When Genshin Impact was first revealed, many wrote it off as a Breath of the Wild clone and nothing more. But tunes quickly changed when the game launched. Genshin Impact certainly borrows a lot from Breath of the Wild, from the art style to the stamina-based climbing. However, in almost every other way, it separates itself with deep RPG systems, a diverse roster of 23 characters, and hundreds of hours of gameplay. </p>
<p> And it’s free. Genshin Impact offers a full-action RPG experience in a beautiful open world without asking for a dime. There are microtransactions in the game, but thankfully, they never feel unfair. Buying a few key items may help you level up your character faster, for example, but you can still get through all of the content in the game without resorting to mindless grinding. </p>
<p> Warframe </p>
<p> Combining the futuristic science-fiction aesthetic of Mass Effect and Halo games with slick, martial arts-inspired combat, Warframe is one of the most impressive action games available right now, and you can play it on both consoles and PC. It launched in 2013 and has only seen its player-base grow substantially over the last few years — more than 26 million people have played it so far — and though it’s free-to-play, Warframe still serves as an excellent example of the technical capabilities of the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4. </p>
<p> Warframe also includes a remarkable number of customization options, which allow you to modify your weapons and “Warframe” exo-armor, thus letting you better cater your gear toward your specific playstyle. You even have access to your own personal spaceship, which you’ll use as your base when between missions. Once you touch down on foot, however, your mobility won’t be limited; seven different parkour moves allow you to navigate hard-to-reach areas and get the drop on enemies. </p>
<p> World of Tanks </p>
<p> It has spawned spin-off games focusing on ferocious naval and air battles, but nothing can top the intense warfare offered in the original World of Tanks. Featuring armored destroyers from America, England, Germany, China, France, and the Soviet Union (among other nations), World of Tanks’ multiplayer matches are absolutely massive, with teams constantly vying to gain tactical positions over one another as they fire long-range shots, flank enemies, and protect their allies. Tanks have roughly a dozen different armored plates, too, each with their own level of protection against incoming fire. </p>
<p> For those willing to risk their skin a little bit more, the “self-propelled gun” class will allow you to take out a large number of enemies, provided they don’t immediately spot you and blow you to oblivion. A detailed guide — available on the game’s official website — will get you started with your first tank from any of the available classes, and it offers some additional tips to keep your tank in one piece during your first few matches. Once you’re feeling comfortable with the game’s combat, you can join a clan and attempt to take control of the “global map,” which not only earns you bragging rights but also special vehicles and in-game currency. </p>
<p> Call of Duty: Warzone </p>
<p> Warzone isn’t Call of Duty’s first foray into the battle royale genre, but it is the best. Formally, Activision left the battle royale duties to Call of Duty: Blackout, which would be a competent enough battle royale game if it weren’t hidden behind the $60 paywall that is Black Ops 4. Warzone is not only a better battle royale game, it’s also a free-to-play and cross-platform game. </p>
<p> Those two things are what sell Warzone. The game functions as an extension to 2019’s Modern Warfare, utilizing the same excellent engine and matchmaking capabilities. As long as you have a PC, Xbox One, or PS4, and you can download Warzone and play with your friends, regardless of what system they’re on. </p>
<p> Warzone evolves the battle royale formula, too. The biggest change is the Gulag. If you die, you’re sent to the Gulag once for a one-on-one showdown. If you win, you redeploy for free, and if you lose, your teammates will have to buy you back. This mechanic removes any feel-bad moments from Warzone where you happen to fall into an area with no loot and someone kills you before you can get your bearings. </p>
<p> Fortnite: Battle Royale </p>
<p> Following in the footsteps of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds comes Fortnite: Battle Royale, a free player-versus-player chunk of Epic Games’ zombie defense shooter. Like PUBG, the goal in Fortnite: Battle Royale is to take down all the other players in the game and be the last one standing. But Fortnite‘s cartoonish take on shooting mechanics means you get an alternative to PUBG‘s more militaristic (and somewhat more realistic) shooter. </p>
<p> There’s another aspect to Fortnite that sets it apart from PUBG — building. You can construct walls, structures, and objects that can give you a leg-up in a fight, or leave you vulnerable to ambush. Either way, the addition of creating your own battleground and fortifications can alter the last players standing rules significantly. </p>
<p> Apex Legends </p>
<p> Set in the world of Titanfall but without titans or wall-running, Apex Legends is Respawn’s take on the battle royale genre. Apex Legends is all about teamwork, with 20 three-person teams vying to be the last team standing. The progression of a match will be familiar to anyone who has played a battle royale: Drop from the sky, scavenge for gear, make it inside the circle before the playable area shrinks. Where Apex Legends differs is that it also has hero shooter elements. Each of the eight characters has their own unique abilities and ultimate moves ranging from defensive moves to portal warping to all-out mortar strikes. And death isn’t permanent. You can revive fallen teammates and even resurrect them by bringing their dog tags to a beacon. </p>
<p> Apex Legends is a polished experience with excellent gunplay, a great map, and a fun roster of characters. It’s one of the best free-to-play shooters around and is available as a PS4 game, Xbox One game, and one of the best free PC games. </p>
<p> Hearthstone </p>
<p> Blizzard is the master of polish, and this was never more apparent than when the developer released Hearthstone in 2014. Taking fan-favorite characters from the Warcraft series (Thrall, Jaina Proudmoore, and many more) players battle in a Magic: The Gathering-style card duel to the virtual death, using a variety of spells and minions — including Murlocs — in an effort to lower their opponent’s health to zero. </p>
<p> It’s a deceptively simple premise. Aside from “mana crystals,” which determine how many cards — and which cards — you can play in any one turn, there aren’t many unique game mechanics to Hearthstone. Yet the game’s brisk matches and wide range of strategies will keep you itching to play one more game. </p>
<p> New cards, which can be purchased using gold earned through normal play, help you develop your own custom decks. You can also get cards more quickly by spending real money, though gold is given out at such a liberal rate that you can stick with playing free if you hone in on a single competitive deck. </p>
<p> Magic: The Gathering Arena </p>
<p> Hearthstone is like Magic: The Gathering, but Arena is Magic: The Gathering. Known for popularizing, if not straight up creating, the collectible card game genre, Magic has a storied history. Although more involved than the other card games listed here, the core premise of Magic is simple. Lands produce mana, which you can use to cast spells, and you can play one land per turn. It’s identical to Hearthstone in that regard, with the only difference being resource management. </p>
<p> You actually have to have a land in hand in order to get mana for that turn, whereas most other digital card games handle the mana scaling automatically. Although that may seem like a downside, it really isn’t. The variance in Magic is one of its core tenets, allowing players with a very weak deck to win against very powerful decks if they have the right draw. </p>
<p> Like other digital CCGs, Arena is free-to-play, though you’ll have to spend some money to get a proper deck. The best course of action is to choose which format you want to play most. If you’re interested in drafting, you’ll slowly build a collection to put together a competitive deck or two. If you only want to play constructed, where you build a deck from whatever cards you want, it’s best just to buy some packs. Thankfully, Arena dishes out free packs left and right, and with the wildcard system, you can craft whatever extra cards you need. Although buying a competitive deck can get expensive, it’s much cheaper than buying that deck physically, where cards can cost $60 or more a piece. </p>
<p> Killer Instinct </p>
<p> Nearly two decades after the release of the original game, Microsoft and Double Helix relaunched Killer Instinct as a tough-as-nails fighter with enough style to give Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter a run for their money. Classic characters such as Jago, TJ Combo, and Sabrewulf make their return, and the game has remained a staple in the competitive fighting scene since it launched in 2013. Developer Iron Galaxy has improved upon the formula in the last few years, too, and the addition of awesome combatants like Spinal and Battletoads’ Rash add variety and a healthy dose of nostalgia. </p>
<p> All modes are available in Killer Instinct without paying a dime, but you’re limited to just one character at a time. However, Xbox Live Gold subscribers have received the “Ultra Edition” of the game’s first season for free in the past. </p>
<p> Brawlhalla </p>
<p> After spending a couple of years in early access, Brawhlhalla, a fighting game that can only really be compared to Super Smash Bros., released as a free-to-play title in 2017. In 2018, Blue Mammoth Games, the studio behind the peculiar brawler, was acquired by Ubisoft. Brawlhalla‘s ascent to landing with one of the biggest video game studios in the world means that the game will reach new heights. Currently, it’s available on PS4, Switch, Xbox One, and PC. Ubisoft’s spunky mascot Rayman will enter the fight then, too. </p>
<p> From a core gameplay perspective, Brawlhalla mirrors Smash in that the goal is to knock other fighters off the map. It features a simple control scheme that lets new players jump in quickly, which is perfect for a free-to-play game. Additionally, a myriad of interesting game modes, a plethora of maps, and a robust roster of fighters keep the experience fresh. And yes, weapons fall from the sky just like in Smash. In the free-to-play model, Brawlhalla lets players play as six different fighters each week. If you spend $20, you unlock all 41 fighters and all future fighters, including Rayman. It’s fast, easy to play, and has an engaging progression system. </p>
<p> League of Legends </p>
<p> No free-to-play list would be complete without League of Legends. The MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) was nothing short of a revolutionary when it first landed on PC in 2009, and it has only improved in the years since its original release. The game is free to play with a limited number of heroes, called Champions, and more can be purchased using either real money or “IP,” which is earned through normal play. Though the genre has never been particularly inviting to new players, Riot has created a more newbie-friendly multiplayer experience than some of its contemporaries, and if you’re just getting started, there is almost a 100% chance that one of your friends already plays League of Legends. </p>
<p> Dota 2 </p>
<p> Though it’s harder to learn than League of Legends and Blizzard’s Heroes of the Storm, Dota 2 players will accept no substitute. Unlike League, all 119 heroes are available for free in Dota 2, including the melee-focused Earth Spirit, who resembles an odd mix of the Iron Giant and the Incredible Hulk, and the Invoker, whose appearance is similar to the elves seen in the Warcraft franchise. The game’s combat is hectic, and you’re likely to get beaten into oblivion during your first round, but should the addiction take hold, you might not need to play another game for months to come. The highlight of the game is the massive competitive championship called The International, where players battle for millions of dollars in prize money. You could win — well, if you spend your entire life playing the game, that is. </p>
<p> Heroes of the Storm </p>
<p> Although not directly advertised or viewed internally as a MOBA, Blizzard’s Heroes of the Storm has all the trappings of a MOBA. It’s five-on-five and features a wide array of heroes (currently 89) split into four roles: Specialist, Warrior, Support, and Assassin. Heroes of the Storm hasn’t achieved the same level of notoriety as League of Legends or Dota 2, but it’s a satisfying and deep experience in its own right. With 15 maps and a slew of game modes, including ranked, unranked, and even CPU battles, Heroes of the Storm has enough content to keep you playing for the long haul. Of course, you have to have an affinity for MOBAs, but we’ve found that Heroes of the Storm is a bit easier to get into than League and Dota. </p>
<p> Smite </p>
<p> Smite has been a mainstay in the MOBA genre since 2014. It stands out for its third-person presentation, differentiating itself from League, Heroes of the Storm, and Dota 2. The change in perspective also alters the play style, changing the traditionally strategic MOBA formula to action-oriented gameplay. The game’s heroes are all gods modeled after real ones across twelve different pantheons. As of now, there are 110 playable characters, each with their own abilities. Smite‘s 5-on-5 contests are always interesting, as it’s not uncommon to see CPU-controlled enemies crop up across the battlefields. Smite is available on PC, Xbox One, and PS4. </p>
<p> Tetris 99 </p>
<p> Tetris 99 mashes the iconic puzzle game with the hottest genre around: Battle royale. Can you outlast 98 other Tetris players? Armed with four different attack commands that direct your garbage to other players, Tetris 99 adds an extra layer of strategy to the most expertly designed puzzle game ever created. It can be overwhelming dealing with attacks from several players at once, but the relentless pace at which Tetris 99 forces you to play at makes for a constantly invigorating experience. Who would have thought that a classic game like Tetris would make for one of the best battle royale games available today? Tetris 99 is exclusive to Nintendo Switch, specifically Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. </p>
<p> EVE Online </p>
<p> EVE Online is arguably the most storied massively multiplayer online game in existence. The huge space exploration title sees rising and falling empires and allegiances as players wage war on each other. Players fly around a galaxy in spaceships, mining resources, getting into scuffles, trading with one another, and basically playing whatever role they want. The best rewards require the biggest risks, and you’re not always safe when other players want what you have. </p>
<p> Though it’s notoriously difficult to get into, EVE Online is a huge, deep game with a big following of dedicated players. It’s so involved that it’s quickly spawning its own history, and every so often, players turn its inky void into a giant battlefield where whole armadas wage war on one another. And now that the game is free, it’s possible to find out what the deal is with EVE Online with minimal investment. </p>
<p> Star Wars: The Old Republic </p>
<p> Like many MMOs, Star Wars: The Old Republic started as a subscription-based experience before floundering and turning free-to-play. That’s not to say The Old Republic is a bad game in the slightest. In fact, from a production value standpoint, BioWare’s The Old Republic is one of the most impressive games on this list. With excellent writing and fully voiced dialogue, lots of Star Wars lore, and differentiated storylines based on classes, The Old Republic offers a deep experience that demands to be played and revisited from multiple vantage points. The gameplay, which is real-time combat similar to the other Old Republic games, is serviceable throughout both mainline quests and the PvP mode. You can play as either the Republic or Empire and choose between four classes on each side of the struggle. For fans of Star Wars, The Old Republic offers one of the most narratively ambitious stories in the galaxy far, far away. If you haven’t tried it yet, you can play a sizable amount of content for free on PC. </p>
<p> Neverwinter </p>
<p> A delightful combination of Diablo and Dungeons & Dragons, Neverwinter is a streamlined RPG with a satisfying loop. Like D&D, combat is determined by dice rolls which determine how many hits (or misses) each attack will dole out. Neverwinter has 10 PvE campaigns and a neat PvP campaign as well. A welcoming new player experience makes Neverwinter feel right at home on PS4 and Xbox One. Whether you’re into Dungeons & Dragons or not, Neverwinter is a fun experience that offers a more approachable RPG experience than many of its peers. </p>
<p> Path of Exile </p>
<p> Heavily inspired by the Diablo series, Path of Exile is an excellent online action RPG with a great loop and tons of fun (and free!) content. Designed by Grinding Gear Games, Path of Exile released in 2013 to positive critical reception, but it has only improved since with new expansions, adding new items, skills, and story content. </p>
<p> Players pick between one of seven classes — Witch, Shadow, Ranger, Marauder, Duelist, Templar, and Scion — each of which has their own movesets, strengths, and weaknesses. </p>
<p> Path of Exile plays with an isometric just like Diablo, along with having a similar interface and default control scheme. The main difference, which helps give Path of Exile its legs, is the random generation. Besides camps, all of the dungeons and open areas are randomly generated, so each time you replay a section, it will be set up differently. Path of Exile is available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. </p>
<p> DC Universe Online </p>
<p> Since 2011, DC Universe Online has offered users the ability to play as their favorite DC superheroes or even create their own. An MMORPG that quickly dropped its subscription model to go free-to-play, DC Universe Online features a series of quests across Metropolis and Gotham City. </p>
<p> Fast-paced combat, interesting end-game raids, and surprisingly fun PvP matches make for a diverse experience across dozens of hours. Besides daily quests and new storylines, DC Universe Online still receives regular updates. If you’re into superheroes, DC Universe Online is certainly worth trying out on PS4, Xbox One, or PC. </p>
<p> Among Us </p>
<p> This entry is cheating just a bit. Technically, Among Us costs $5 on Steam. However, the game is free on Android and iOS, and all three platforms support crossplay with each other. Among Us is one of the most popular games in the U.S. right now, topping Steam charts with concurrent player counts reaching near 500,000. It’s easy to see why, too. </p>
<p> Among Us is a simple social deduction game where up to 10 players team up to complete a range of small tasks. The kicker: There’s an imposter among the group. As a crew member, it’s your job to not only sniff out who the imposter is, but also to complete your tasks before the imposter can snuff you out. Among Us offers endless hours of fun, and with its pick-up-and-play design, anyone can jump in on the action. </p>
<p> Pokémon Go </p>
<p> Pokémon Go was nothing short of a phenomenon when it launched in 2016 as a mobile Pokémon game. Unlike the other games on our list, it actively encourages you to get out of your house and go explore your neighborhood, city, and even other countries in order to catch Pokémon. The allure of capturing a rare monster so that you can show it off to your friends has kept us playing for months, as has the Instinct, Valor, and Mystic teams’s ongoing battle for world supremacy. Given there are so many Pokémon masters in the wild now, it will be a little bit of a struggle for a newcomer to make a name for themselves, but with a little luck and a whole lot of walking, you can be the very best. </p>
<p> Substantial updates released following the game’s initial launch have only improved the experience. Additional Pokémon, interface and performance improvements, and holiday events have helped keep the game feeling fresh, even following the release of Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield. </p>
<p> Crusader Kings II </p>
<p> After several years as a paid title, Paradox moved Crusader Kings II to a free-to-play model late last year. It makes sense, too, with over $300 worth of downloadable content (not microtransactions; these grand strategy types just have a long shelf life). If you’ve never played a Paradox game, know this: People play these games religiously. Only two years after the initial release of Crusader Kings II, the game was constantly hitting over 10,000 concurrent players each day with an average playtime of 99 hours. That’s because Crusader Kings II is one of the best strategy games of all time. </p>
<p> It earns the “grand” in grand strategy, too. A single game takes upwards of 50 hours to complete, and it’s easy to see why. Mechanics like religion are deeper than most other strategy games, with each religious group having multiple subdivisions (Orthodox and Messalian in the Christian category, for example). This kind of depth is echoed throughout all of Crusader Kings II. Now is the perfect time to get familiar, too, with the release of Crusader Kings III on the horizon. </p>
<p> StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty </p>
<p> In 2017, one of the best real-time strategy games went free-to-play roughly seven years after launch. If you haven’t played StarCraft II before, what are you waiting for? You can download it for free and play through the excellent Wings of Liberty campaign, then jump online and test your skills. The game’s two expansion packs, Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void, still cost money, but you can get dozens of hours of play with one of the best strategy games ever made without spending a dime. What a bargain. </p>
<p> Fallout Shelter </p>
<p> Fallout Shelter is such an addictive, charming take on Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic series that it nearly overshadowed the launch of Fallout 4 in 2015. The premise is simple — attract survivors to your vault, then protect them against invading forces, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst. At the same time, you must keep them happy enough to reproduce and rebuild humanity. </p>
<p> It’s a game that only requires a few minutes of your time, but often encourages you to send survivors on various missions, defend against raids, and build new rooms in your vault. The game also opts for a cartoonish art style that translates the signature Vault Boy into a charming — and borderline creepy — family of diligent vault-dwellers. The game is now available on PC, consoles, and mobile devices, and given it has no links to the aforementioned Fallout 4, you’re left with nothing to worry about other than the survival of your people. Well, that and radroaches. </p>
<p> Destiny 2 </p>
<p> Destiny 2 is the poster child for the games-as-a-service model, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad game. Far from it, in fact — Destiny 2 is a sprawling online shooter with ultra-tight gun mechanics and some of the most intense combat encounters in gaming. Although originally released for a full $60, Destiny 2 is now free to play. Even better, Bungie overhauled the leveling system once the game’s price fell away, so you don’t need to worry about hundreds of hours of grinding. </p>
<p> Like a lot of games-as-a-service titles, though, Destiny 2 is what you make of it. The visuals are stunning and the mechanics are world-class, but tackling the world alone is a lonely experience — even with the best Destiny 2 weapons. It’s a game best played with friends, where the driving forces of progression are the wild experiences you’ll have during missions. If playing solo is more your speed, you can always grind matches in Destiny 2′s Crucible PvP mode. </p>
<p> Valorant </p>
<p> In the last few months, we’ve seen two newcomers to the free-to-play shooter genre: Valorant and Crucible. The latter didn’t even survive a full launch. Valorant, thankfully, did. In short, Valorant is a competitive online shooter where you play Counter-Strike-like matches. There are two teams: One has the goal of planting the bomb (the “spike”), and the other is trying to diffuse it. On top of that, though, Valorant adds a roster of MOBA-like heroes. </p>
<p> Valorant combines so many elements from other genres that it creates something new entirely. The game plays like CS:GO, sure, but after a few rounds, it’s clear that Valorant is operating on a different level. It’s engrossing, complex, and, best of all, free-to-play. Unfortunately, though, it’s only available on PC. </p>
<p> Team Fortress 2 </p>
<p> Originally packaged inside The Orange Box in 2007, Valve’s Team Fortress 2 was an instant success in the multiplayer shooter realm. The class-based shooter with nine differentiated classes featured a slew of competitive game modes upon release, including Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, and several other objective-based modes. Although more than a decade old and overshadowed by a hero shooter called Overwatch, Valve has continued to support the PC version of the game in recent years. </p>
<p> It went free-to-play in 2011 and now supports both ranked play and casual matches. Team Fortress 2 is not only a great game today, but it’s an important part of video game history. You can enjoy the whole experience for free. If you so choose, though, you can purchase cosmetic items in-game. </p>
<p> Paladins: Champions of the Realm </p>
<p> A hero-shooter from the makers of Smite, Paladins: Champions of the Realm plays a lot like Overwatch. With four character classes — Front Line, Damage, Flank, and Support — and a unique card-based loadout system, Paladins manages to differentiate itself from the popular Blizzard FPS just enough to not be seen as a mere clone. The card-based loadout system adds strategic depth, giving you perks like cooldown reductions for charge weapons, all of which are customizable. </p>
<p> Each of the three game modes — Siege, Onslaught, and team deathmatch — work well, the maps are varied and interesting. The best part about Paladins is that it’s available on all major platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch. </p>
<p> Planetside 2 </p>
<p> Planetside 2‘s massive battles make Battlefield’s spacious maps look rather tiny. This intergalactic FPS has a unique system in that everything you do affects your faction rating. Three factions duke it out to control important territories and take over needed resources. What’s most interesting about Planetside 2 is that battles can often take days, even weeks. They are simply on such a large scale that when you log off, other faction members will pick up where you left off. With a deep customization system, an intricate skill tree, and a wide array of combat scenarios, Planetside 2 rarely feels anything but fresh. Planetside 2 is available on PC and PS4. </p>
<p> Counter-Strike: Global Offensive </p>
<p> Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, really, the first proper Counter-Strike game. CS 1.6 and Source are both great, but Global Offensive is the game that has stuck, and it’s easy to see why. Everything about CS:GO is tight, from the gunplay to the map designs. It’s a proper competitive shooter, and although Valve sold it as such for a mere $14.99 for a long time, it’s now totally free to play. </p>
<p> “Totally” is the best way to describe it, too. Unlike most other free-to-play games, there is absolutely no advantage to spending money in CS:GO. If you’re good enough, you can play ranked matches as often as you want while staying on a level playing field. In the world of free-to-play games, that’s a feat. </p>
<p> The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit </p>
<p> The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a completely free-to-play narrative experience from Dontnod, the studio behind Life is Strange. It’s set within the same universe and takes place three years after the first game. Chris Eriksen, a boy who recently lost his mother, creates a superhero alter ego, Captain Spirit, to help himself work through the loss. Beware: Captain Spirit is a tearjerker. </p>
<p> With great writing, a compelling story, and a lot of heart, Captain Spirit is a moving experience that fans of the Telltale formula should definitely play. Your choices made in the game can carry over into Life is Strange 2 since Chris is a character in the sequel. The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is available on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. </p>
<p> Doki Doki Literature Club </p>
<p> It’s hard to write about Doki Doki Literature Club without spoiling anything, but here we go. </p>
<p> A teenage girl invites her male friend to join the school’s literature club. At first, it seems that the game is a funny dating simulator. But throughout this visual novel, which sometimes involves player choice, Doki Doki Literature Club takes a sly and dark turn. </p>
<p> The game will mess with your head. It’s unnerving, mesmerizing, and wholly engrossing. It’s available as free experience on PC and Mac, though you can donate to its creators. A $10 donation gets you concept art and the game’s soundtrack. </p>
<p> Frog Fractions </p>
<p> Frog Fractions is an educational game about being a frog. Presented through browsers for many years, the game is now available for free on Steam, with 4K support to boot. As a frog, you sit on a lily pad and snatch bugs out of the air with your long tongue. These challenges are mixed with lessons about typing, math, and more. Between rounds, you can purchase upgrades, such as lock-on targeting, to make catching bugs easier. </p>
<p> The fascinating aspect of this game is that you will continue to uncover new information every time you play, so feel free to fall into its rabbit hole. Basically, anything outside of the educational bit is a spoiler, so we’ll just say: Frog Fractions is not just an educational game, and there are more surprises to discover. </p>
<p> Pinball FX3 </p>
<p> The name Pinball FX3 says it all. This virtual pinball game doesn’t rely on generic machines but has a range of accurately modeled machines recreated by developer Zen Studios. The free version of the game offers the well-known Fish Tales pinball board for download. After you’ve played a few rounds of free pinball, you’ll be hungry to explore the massive variety of pinball boards you’ll have to purchase to play. You can buy additional machines from Zen Studios, usually in sets of three, for around $10. In total, there’s nearly $300 worth of DLC, so Pinball FX3 can get costly after a while. But frequent sales bring down the price of the most popular packs to only a few dollars. </p>
<p> Pinball FX3 is a proper simulator, fitted with leagues, one-on-one multiplayer, and community-generated tournaments. For occasional players who want to play recreationally in their spare time, FX3 offers traditional single-player games as well. Every pinball simulator is distinct, with a unique course of obstacles and different ways to earn points, so you’ll never get tired of gaming. </p>

<p> What Is the Best Lottery to Play? </p>
<p> Everyone has different preferences and criteria for just about everything, including which lottery they choose to play. Some prefer to play for the biggest jackpots, while others would rather play lotteries with smaller jackpots but better odds of winning. Here are some ideas and tips you can use to help you choose which is the best lottery for you to play next when buying your tickets. </p>
<p> Which Lotteries Have the Biggest Jackpots? </p>
<p> The record for the biggest lottery jackpot ever was set in January 2016 when the Powerball hit $1.58 billion, an amazing prize that was split between three winning tickets. Each of those tickets was awarded a lump sum payment of $327.8 million. Mega Millions came close to breaking that record when it awarded a $1.537 billion jackpot in October 2018. Mega Millions did set one record in that draw, as the jackpot prize was the biggest ever awarded to a single ticket! </p>
<p> Seeing that the top ten lottery jackpots of all time have been set by two American lotteries - US Powerball and US Mega Millions - leads to an initial conclusion that these are the best lotteries to play. Their enormous jackpots, as well as their massive prize pools, attract not only huge publicity but also large throngs of players. Over 600 million tickets were sold for the drawing when the record Powerball jackpot fell. With that amount of competition, one could possibly conclude the only barrier to winning a huge jackpot prize is buying a Powerball ticket. </p>
<p> Many lotteries have guaranteed starting jackpots, and if you know a bit about how lottery jackpots are calculated, you know that they rise very quickly when ticket sales are strong. </p>
<p> As for prize pool size, no lottery can compete with the Spanish Loteria de Navidad. This annual Christmas season raffle offers a staggering €2.38 billion in prizes. The odds for winning a Navidad prize are very attractive: 1 in 7. </p>
<p> Which Lottery Fits Your Budget? </p>
<p> You should only play the lottery based on what you can afford! But do you find yourself compelled to play when the jackpots are really, really big? Fortunately, you can enjoy playing the lottery without overspending. There’s a lottery for everyone! </p>
<p> The price of lottery tickets is determined by many different factors, such as prize amounts, how many lines you purchase, adding on special features, and more. Here’s a breakdown of some of the most cost-efficient lotteries for every budget! </p>
<p> If you’re new to lotteries or simply want to save money, we have some great news for you! Like many things in life, lotteries are not one-size-fits-all. Playing the lottery doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg, in fact, it can cost less than €2. While the lotteries with cheaper tickets do tend to have smaller prizes, they’re usually much easier to win. South Africa Powerball and South Africa Lotto are great examples of lotteries that give you bang for your buck! While they both have humble starting jackpots, their value easily rolls into the millions before it’s won, setting you back less than a euro per line! </p>
<p> Other good, affordable options are Australia Monday Lotto, Wednesday Lotto, and Saturday Lotto. As some of the most cost-efficient lotteries in our opinion, the Australian Lotto series actually has some of the lowest ticket prices on our site, yet still manages to reward winners with millionaire-making jackpots at every draw. </p>
<p> So which lotteries have the best balance of price and prize? We would have to go with Italy's SuperEnalotto on this one. For a lottery that awards some of the biggest jackpots in the world, the tickets are definitely worth it! Compared to other lotteries which have similar, or even smaller top prizes, SuperEnalotto’s ticket prices are definitely on the lower end of the spectrum. </p>
<p> Other well-balanced lotteries in terms of the price to prize ratio are Lotto Texas and Spain La Primitiva. Both lotteries have very reasonably priced tickets, especially when you look at their fantastic starting jackpots of $5 million and €5 million respectively. </p>
<p> There are many rewarding lotteries to choose from! It may be obvious, but we think that US Powerball is the top contender for this price point. The tickets may be a bit pricey, but for a lottery that hands out the biggest jackpots in the world, you can’t go wrong! Another honourable mention is France Loto. Although it does have some of the priciest tickets on our list, the fantastic prize-winning odds and €1 million jackpot increase after each rollover make this French favourite a lottery that you should seriously consider! </p>
<p> What Is the Best Lottery to Play? Take a Look at Lottery Odds and Jackpot Odds </p>
<p> The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292 million. Before the Powerball introduced a rule change in October 2015, the odds were 1 in 175 million. Lottery officials undoubtedly realize that with reduced odds, there is less chance of winning and this creates larger jackpots. This in turn, increases ticket sales. But, are the best lottery odds in Powerball the best in the lottery field? </p>
<p> Mega Millions, in comparison, offers one in 302.6 million odds of winning the jackpot, not much of a difference. The odds of winning the EuroMillions jackpot are 1 in 139.8 million while the odds of winning EuroJackpot 's top prize are slightly better - 1 in 95 million. </p>
<p> Small lotteries can be candidates for the best lottery games as well. Even though the jackpots may be smaller, the odds of winning them are better. The odds to win the Australia Powerball jackpot are 1 in 76.7 million; the odds in the Spain La Primitiva lottery are 1 in 13.9 million; and the odds in the Ireland Lotto are better yet – 1 in 10.7 million. With lower jackpot odds, there is less of a chance that a jackpot will go unclaimed for long. </p>
<p> The lotteries with the actual best odds of winning the jackpot prize would have to go to daily lotteries. Although lotteries staged every day tend to have jackpots that run on the smaller side, the odds of winning are so good that the top prizes are routinely awarded at every draw! For example, at 1 in 98,280, Mexico’s Chispazo has some of the best odds of winning in the world as a result of the tiny guess range of just 1-28 and twice daily draws. Irish Daily Million is another twice-daily lottery that offers fantastic odds and a €1 million jackpot prize every single day. So if you’re looking for a cost-efficient way to win quick cash, playing daily lotteries may just be the ticket! </p>
<p> The Best Lottery Game to Play May Depend on the Time Factor </p>
<p> Do you often feel that you’re just too busy to think about which lottery to play next? We’ve all been in that position. So what can you do? One super easy option is choosing a lottery according to its draw time. If you go on our Lottery List page, you’ll see a Next Draw column on the left-hand side which tells you exactly how much time is left until the next immediate draw. So if you’re debating, why not be spontaneous and choose one of the lotteries that are closing soon? Who knows, it may just lead to your lucky break! </p>
<p> Best Lotto to Play? Consider Lotteries With Special Features </p>
<p> If you’re still not sure which lottery you want to play, why not check out which ones have additional special features? Many lotteries have exciting play options, such as prize multipliers to ticket refunds, that unfortunately go under the radar. These give the player a much more dynamic experience by creating more opportunities to win as well as awarding players with exciting boosted prizes. </p>
<p> Check out this list of lotteries that offer rewarding playing options you may not have known about: </p>
<p> Multipliers and Game Extras </p>
<p> Lottery multipliers, like the Mega Millions Megaplier, can increase your non-jackpot winnings. When adding the multiplier on a Mega Millions ticket, for example, players can increase the second-place prize by up to 5 times! </p>
<p> On the other hand, Italy’s SuperEnalotto has its own extra game feature called SuperStar. With Superstar you choose an additional number between 1-90 on top of your regular SuperEnalotto game play. If you win, this additional game feature adds €2 million to the jackpot prize! </p>
<p> Mega Millions: Megaplier </p>
<p> Powerball: Power Play </p>
<p> SuperEnalotto: SuperStar </p>
<p> Texas Lotto: Extra! </p>
<p> Second Chance Divisions/Bonus Balls </p>
<p> Bonus balls were added into the mix to make the games more exciting and dynamic. Bonus balls are drawn separately from the main numbers and are used to create additional prize divisions. This can apply to just one prize division or all of them depending on the game. Let’s take SuperEnalotto’s Jolly number for example. When players match the Jolly number along with 5 of the main numbers drawn, they’ll receive a boosted second division prize called a SuperBonus! Another lottery that utilizes bonus balls is Japan Loto 7 which has 2 bonus balls that create three new prize divisions: 2nd, 6th, and 7th. A few more examples of lotteries that feature bonus balls are Ireland Lotto, Japan Loto 6, La Primitiva, and BonoLoto to name a few! </p>
<p> Ticket Refunds </p>
<p> Lottery ticket refunds is a uniquely Spanish idea. Three of Spain’s most popular lotteries, El Gordo, BonoLoto and La Primitiva, each have a special bonus ball called a Reintegro. Unlike most lotteries that utilize bonus balls to create new prize divisions, when the Reintegro, or refund number is matched, the winner quite literally will receive a refund on the cost of their lottery. Players can receive a refund by matching the Reintegro number with any of the main numbers, as well as simply matching the additional number by itself. Maybe a game offering ticket refunds is the best lotto to play! </p>
<p> Choosing Which Lottery to Play? Take Taxes into Account! </p>
<p> There are many tax-free lottery games around the globe. Prizes in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK, among other countries, are paid out tax-free at source, however winning players may be subject to local taxation based on their country of residence. You could choose what is the best lottery to play based on how many taxes you would need to pay, however it would be wise to check all financial matters with a tax professional when you win. </p>
<p> So, Which Is the Best Lottery to Play? </p>
<p> There are a number of factors to consider when choosing which is the best lottery to play, including the odds, the jackpot prizes, the price of tickets, and the taxes. It is often difficult to make an informed decision. </p>
<p> Take for example the Australia Saturday Lotto and the Spain BonoLoto. These two lotteries may not offer the highest jackpots or the best winning odds, yet playing them gives players the best run for their money. </p>
<p> One additional thing to consider. Winning a lottery prize is most certainly a matter of luck. Because not even a psychic can help you win the lottery, many players simply go with their gut in choosing both the lottery they'll play and the numbers they'll select. It is more than likely that the best lottery game to play is different for everyone. The best advice, therefore, would be to play the lotteries which appear to be luckiest for you. </p>

<doc id="file21596554" filename="Buy-to-play" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy-to-play">
<p> Buy-to-play (B2P) is a revenue model for video games that can only be played by purchasing the game, as opposed to there being a subsequent subscription fee for playing the game. Buy-to-play, while a form of premium games, generally apply to games where there is continued ongoing content or support from the developer or publisher well beyond the period of purchase, such as through maintenance of online servers or through the production of ongoing content and expansions, as often the case in massively multiplayer online games (MMO). This support is monetized through additional microtransactions or through an ongoing subscription fee. Microtransactions are becoming evermore entwined with the Buy-to-play revenue model as most recent games allow for some sort of additional purchase. For example, buy-to-play title Guild Wars 2 allows players to purchase additional in-game items with microtransactions, while Destiny 2 lets users purchase season passes for additional content.[1][2] </p>
<p> Buy-to-play can be contrasted with Free-to-play (F2P), where users are granted access to a fully functional game (usually with limitations), but must pay microtransactions to access additional content. Some studies have been completed on the success of the free-to-play revenue model and also gamers' perception of this method. The results of one study shows that players are often satisfied with purchases made in free-to-play games, however, they believe a lot of content is overpriced. The study also displayed that free-to-play game developers create restrictions in order to encourage more purchases.[3] </p>
<p> Pay-to-play (P2P) is a model in which a subscription payment is required on an ongoing basis, in order to use a service. When comparing the three revenue models, the free-to-play model is slowly rising in popularity as the buy-to-play and pay-to-play models are decreasing in relative popularity. This trend can be roughly shown by the number of World of Warcraft subscribers over the years. Since 2011, the number of subscribers has been decreasing with the exception of a few small spikes.[4] Overall, the buy-to-play model is sure to stick around for a long period of time as it remains one of the most popular methods of acquiring games, but trends point to it adopting some methods from the free-to-play and pay-to-play models. </p>
<p> Buy-to-play games require a one time fee to install and play. Some games, such as ArenaNet's Guild Wars 2 uses in-game advertising or "Cash Shops" to provide income for buy-to-play games, which usually offset the subscription fee of a pay-to-play game. </p>

<p> Welcome to The Rift </p>
<p> Learn The Basics </p>
<p> There’s a lot to learn about League, so we’ll start with the essentials. Explore the guide below to get the rundown on the most popular game mode. </p>
<p> Let’s Go </p>
<p> About The Game </p>
<p> What is League of Legends? </p>
<p> League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the other’s base. Choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory. </p>
<p> Goal </p>
<p> Destroy The Base </p>
<p> The Nexus is the heart of both teams’ bases. Destroy the enemy’s Nexus first to win the game. </p>
<p> 1 / 2 </p>
<p> Your Nexus </p>
<p> Your Nexus is where minions spawn. Behind your Nexus is the Fountain, where you can quickly replenish health and mana and access the Shop. </p>
<p> Enemy Nexus </p>
<p> Located in the enemy team’s base, the enemy Nexus is just like yours. Destroying the enemy Nexus wins your team the game. </p>
<p> Structures </p>
<p> Clear The Path </p>
<p> Your team needs to clear at least one lane to get to the enemy Nexus. Blocking your path are defense structures called turrets and inhibitors. Each lane has three turrets and one inhibitor, and each Nexus is guarded by two turrets. </p>
<p> 1 / 2 </p>
<p> Turrets </p>
<p> Turrets deal damage to enemy minions and champions, and provide limited vision from the Fog of War for their team. Attack these structures with minions ahead of you to avoid damage and charge ahead. </p>
<p> Inhibitors </p>
<p> Each Inhibitor is protected by a Turret. When destroyed, super minions will spawn in that lane for several minutes. Afterward, the Inhibitor will respawn and Super Minions will stop spawning. </p>
<p> Neutral Monsters </p>
<p> Take on The Jungle </p>
<p> In between the lanes is the jungle, where neutral monsters and jungle plants reside. The two most important monsters are Baron Nashor and the Drakes. Killing these units grants unique buffs for your team and can also turn the tide of the game. </p>
<p> 1 / 2 </p>
<p> Baron Nashor </p>
<p> Baron Nashor is the most powerful monster in the jungle. Killing Baron grants the slayer’s team bonus attack damage, ability power, empowered recall, and greatly increases the power of nearby minions. </p>
<p> Drakes </p>
<p> Drakes, or dragons, are powerful monsters that grant unique bonuses depending on the element of the drake your team slays. There are four Elemental Drakes and one Elder Dragon. </p>
<p> Lane Positions </p>
<p> Choose your lane </p>
<p> There are five positions that make up the recommended team comp for the game. Each lane lends itself to certain kinds of champions and roles—try them all or lock in to the lane that calls you. </p>
<p> 1 / 5 </p>
<p> Top Lane </p>
<p> Champions in top lane are the tough solo fighters of the team. It’s their job to protect their lane and focus on the enemy team’s most powerful members. </p>
<p> Jungle </p>
<p> Junglers live for the hunt. Stalking between lanes with stealth and skill, they keep a close eye on the most important neutral monsters and pounce the moment an opponent lets their guard down. </p>
<p> Mid Lane </p>
<p> Mid laners are your high burst damage champions who can do it all—solo and as a team. For them, combat is a dangerous dance where they’re always looking for an opportunity to outplay their opponent. </p>
<p> Bot Lane </p>
<p> Bot lane champions are the dynamite of the team. As precious cargo, they need to be protected early on before amassing enough gold and experience to carry the team to victory. </p>
<p> Support </p>
<p> Support champions are team guardians. They help keep teammates alive and primarily focus on setting up kills, protecting their teammate in bot lane until they become stronger. </p>
<p> Powering Up </p>
<p> Power Up Your Champ </p>
<p> Champions get stronger by earning experience to level up and gold to buy more powerful items as the game progresses. Staying on top of these two factors is crucial to overpowering the enemy team and destroying their base. </p>
<p> Earn Experience </p>
<p> When champions earn a certain amount of experience, they level up and can unlock or strengthen abilities and raise their base stats. Gain experience by killing enemy units and champions, assisting in a kill, and destroying defense structures. </p>
<p> Earn Gold </p>
<p> Gold is the in-game currency to buy items for your champion. Earn gold by killing enemy units and champions, assisting in a kill, destroying defense structures, and equipping gold income items. </p>
<p> Shop </p>
<p> The Shop is where you can buy and sell items with gold you’ve earned. It can only be accessed while you are at the Fountain. </p>
<p> Abilities, Spells & Items </p>
<p> Unlock Your Abilities </p>
<p> Champions have five core abilities, two special spells, and up to seven items at a time. Figuring out the optimal ability order, summoner spells, and item build for your champion will help you succeed as a team. </p>
<p> AbilitiesSummoner SpellsItems </p>
<p> AbilitiesSummoner SpellsItems </p>
<p> Most champions have a unique kit made up of five abilities: a Passive, three Basics, and an Ultimate. These abilities are mapped to the Q, W, E, and R keys. </p>
<p> Summoner spells are abilities with unique effects that champions can use. They are mapped to the D and F keys. There are many spells, but a few commonly used ones are Flash, Teleport, Smite, and Ignite. </p>
<p> Items enhance your champion’s performance, like granting faster movement, improved damage, and reduced ability cooldowns. Unlike Trinkets, they require gold to purchase. </p>

<p> How to Play </p>
<p> To connect to any Asheron’s Call emulator server you must first install Asheron’s Call, update the client files, and optionally install Thwarglauncher. </p>
<p> 1: Download the Official Asheron’s Call installer from Turbine. (If the link does not work, right click – Copy Link Address and paste in to your browser.) </p>
<p> 2: Run the ac1install.exe and install to the default location. </p>
<p> 4: Drag the 4 files inside the .zip to your Asheron’s Call folder and choose Replace when prompted. </p>
<p> 6: Be sure to install Thwarglauncher to its default path. </p>
<p> Accounts for most ACE servers are created on first login. </p>
<p> If you have trouble logging in to a specific server you can join the server Discord by clicking the icon next to the server name on Thwarglauncher </p>
<p> 7: Optional – If you wish to use Thwarglauncher in advanced mode you will need to install Decal and add ThwargFilter into Decal. Download Decal. Make sure you pick the latest version and exe or MSI will work as you don’t need both. ***Note*** If you receive an error about not having .NET 2.0 installed get it here and be sure to install it to default locations. You may be asked to install DirectX 9. The web installer found at Microsoft is the latest version and comes with DirectX 9 components that will allow for Decal to install. </p>
<p> 8: Make sure to update Decal so that the red X’s turn to black check marks. Once updated you can add ThwargFilter. </p>
<p> If you let Thwarglauncher install to the default location then you will find ThwargFilter.dll in </p>
<p> C:\Program Files (x86)\Thwargle Games\ThwargLauncher </p>
<p> If you need help adding your private server to Thwarglauncher visit here. </p>
<p> If you’re playing Asheron’s Call on Windows 10, you may have an issue with DirectX. It doesn’t occur for everyone, but for those that get the popup about DirectX failure/errors, first try this workaround: </p>
<p> When at the Character Selection screen, before clicking on Create Character or Enter World, Press and hold the Alt key, then press the Enter key. </p>
<p> The game should switch from Full Screen to Windowed mode and continue to work correctly. </p>
<p> Once you are in the world, you can adjust the game window to be higher resolution. </p>

<p> How to Play Cricket? </p>
<p> Cricket is a game that requires physical agility to bat, bowl, and field. Two teams of 11 players each play at one time. A set of rules were designed for the game by ICC. These are same for both men and women players. The game begins with captains of both teams and match referee gathering for toss. The toss winning captain is allowed to elect to bat/field first. This process is same across all formats. However, the dress code and fielding restrictions vary by format. It is mandatory for players to wear all white for a Test match, and colored tees and trousers for ODI and T20. </p>
<p> Umpires have a key role in the game as they monitor the proceedings. They decide whether the batsman is out, decide on no-ball, wide, and ensure both teams are playing according to the rules. </p>
<p> In this section, we will understand few laws of the game and how a cricket match is played. The cricket game begins with the on-field umpire’s signal “Let’s play!” </p>
<p> Let’s play! A Glimpse of the Game </p>
<p> Two batsmen from the batting-side and 11 players from the fielding-side take positions. Two umpires also join them on the field. One stands at the pitch and the other on leg-side. </p>
<p> Suppose A and B are two teams playing a limited over cricket match. Captain of A wins the toss and elects to bat first. </p>
<p> The game starts with bowler from B team bowling to the first batsman of A team. They are usually called opening-bowler and opening-batsman. The first two batsmen are called openers as they start the innings of their team. </p>
<p> The batsmen hits the balls bowled at them and score runs. Fielders attempt to stop the balls that were hit and even catch them to get the batsmen out. </p>
<p> Each bowler bowls 6 legal deliveries to call it an over. </p>
<p> The bowling and batting ends change after every over. The non-striker at the end of every over becomes the striker of the next over. </p>
<p> The wicket-keeper has to change ends after completion of each over. In general, the keeper stands far from stumps when a fast bowler is bowling and closer to stumps when a spinner is in action. </p>
<p> Once a batsman is out, he has to walk out of the field and a new batsman comes to the crease. An innings is regarded as complete if all the batsmen of team A are out or team B has bowled their full quota of overs. </p>
<p> Now, team B comes on to bat in the second innings to chase the target set by team A. </p>
<p> Team B is accorded as winners if they achieve the target else, A is victorious. </p>
<p> If the scores are level at the end of match, then it is called a tie. </p>
<p> Scoring </p>
<p> Manual and electronic scoring is done during the match to avoid any errors. </p>
<p> The scoring is done on cumulative basis. All the runs scored with bat, extra runs like no-ball, wide, etc. are added to team’s total. </p>
<p> In some instances, on-field umpires find it tough to give few decisions like boundaries, out, no-ball, etc. Therefore, they seek help of another umpire, called third-umpire. </p>
<p> The third-umpire looks at video visuals and gives a final decision. </p>

<p> How to play DVDs in Windows 10 </p>
<p> Watch movies on your computer </p>
<p> How to play DVDs in Windows 10 seems simple enough. You just insert a DVD and press play, right? Surprisingly, there’s no built in DVD playing capabilities in Windows 10. These days, that might seem to make sense since most machines come without a disc drive, but if your computer comes with a DVD drive or you own and want to use an external DVD drive, playing a DVD might seem needlessly confusing. </p>
<p> Luckily, you have quite a few ways to play DVDs in Windows 10 at your disposal. And, we’ll cover the ones we think are best, according to ease of use and convenience. </p>
<p> How to play DVDs on Windows 10 with pre-installed software </p>
<p> If you've purchased a computer with a DVD player built in, odds are very good that it came with its own software for playing DVDs. Since Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 don't have the support built in, computer makers that add DVD players are almost sure to add that support in themselves before shipping out the product. </p>
<p> So, here's what you should do: </p>
<p> Step one: Search for the built-in DVD player software. </p>
<p> If you still have your computers user manual, there may be instructions for playing DVDs in it. You can also search on the manufacturer's website to see which media/DVD playing software they installed. </p>
<p> Another possible way for finding the software is to open the Windows search bar and type in "movies" or "DVD" and see what results pop up. The pre-installed software is likely, though not guaranteed, to appear. </p>
<p> You may even get the software to launch automatically just by putting a DVD into your computer's DVD drive. </p>
<p> Once you've identified the software that came pre-installed, you should easily be able to play your DVDs. </p>
<p> How to play DVDs in Windows 10 with free software </p>
<p> If you're using an external DVD drive or can't find any already installed software for DVD playback on your computer with an internal DVD player, you're never out of luck. </p>
<p> While Microsoft does have a paid option for playing DVDs in Windows 10, you can get by with a great free option. VLC Media Player is the best free video player for countless reasons, and it just so happens to support DVD playback. You can download VLC here. You may also try any software that came bundled with an external DVD drive, as they often come with some. </p>
<p> Step one: Launch VLC </p>
<p> Step two: Insert your DVD </p>
<p> Playback may begin automatically. If it does, you're good to go. If it doesn't, perform the following steps: </p>
<p> Step three: Select Media > Open Disc, or press Ctrl + D with VLC as the active window. </p>
<p> Step four: In the new pop-up menu, under "Disc Selection," choose DVD and press Play at the bottom. </p>
<p> If VLC hasn't identified your DVD, you may have to point out where the disc drive is. You can do that using by pressing browse in the "Disc Selection" section of the pop-up menu and selecting your computers DVD drive from the drive options on the left of the File Explorer window. </p>
<p> How to play DVDs in Windows 10 using Microsoft's paid software </p>
<p> As good as VLC is, we can understand if you're wary of using a third-party software, so we'll provide instructions on Microsoft's software. </p>
<p> Step one: Try Windows Media Player. </p>
<p> Launch Windows Media Player with your DVD inserted. In the navigation menu on the left side of Windows Media Player, you may see your DVD show up. Select it, and try to play it. If your computer came with a pre-installed DVD decoder, the DVD may play. If this doesn't work, try out next step. </p>
<p> Step two: Try the Windows DVD Player app. </p>
<p> You can get the Windows DVD Player app here or by searching for it in the Windows Store. This is a $14.99 app, but you can use it in a trial mode that can help you confirm it will work with your DVD drive. </p>
<p> To download the Trial version, select the three dots next to the Buy button, and select Free Trial. Once it's installed, run it and insert a DVD. If the app determines it is compatible with your device, you can select the Buy Now option to get the complete app and use it to play DVDs. </p>

<p> How to Play Flash Games After the “Death” of Adobe Flash </p>
<p> Some of the best (and worst) Flash games ever live on thanks to these preservation efforts. </p>
<p> Though the news was understandably downplayed during what proved to be a turbulent year, December 31, 2020, marked the end of Adobe’s official support of the Flash Player. The end of their official support cast serious doubt on our ability to easily access a legion of Flash games that have, in their own way, carved a piece of internet culture and history. </p>
<p> As it turns out, the death of Flash was somewhat exaggerated. While it’s true that Adobe has ended their official support of the platform and that many websites are unable to run Flash Player and Flash-based programs as easily as they may have done in the past, there are several viable ways to continue to access various Flash-based games, Flash-based videos, and other content that relies on what will likely be remembered as a rough foundational element of the internet that was nonetheless vital to its growth. </p>
<p> So if you just want to play Crush the Castle, Warfare 1917, Canabalt, or thousands of other memorable Flash games one more time, then here are the best options available to you for accessing them following the “death” of official Flash Players. </p>
<p> Flashpoint </p>
<p> If you’re looking to (fairly) easily access as many Flash games as possible, then you have to check out BlueMaxima’s Flashpoint project. </p>
<p> Ad </p>
<p> Ad – content continues below </p>
<p> Flashpoint is a massive archive of over 38,000 Flash games and nearly 2,500 Flash animations. It’s by far the most comprehensive preservation project of its kind. In fact, it is so comprehensive that you may have some trouble figuring out where you’re supposed to start with it. </p>
<p> Well, if you’re a Windows user who is feeling bold and has space to spare, you can download what’s called Flashpoint Ultimate. This download (which currently sits at 530+ GB) contains the entire Flashpoint collection and allows you to access every file in that collection (even when you’re offline.) </p>
<p> Alternatively, there is the “Flashpoint Infinity” option. This option essentially allows you to download games on a case-by-case basis. While you will need to be connected to the internet during the initial downloads, you’ll be able to access the downloaded files offline after that. </p>
<p> Mac and Linux users can also access versions of these downloads, but because Flash support for those platforms is still in the experimental phase, you may find that not every file works as intended. </p>
<p> While Flashpoint isn’t exactly a complete collection of every Flash game and project ever made, it is an undeniably impressive effort and the best way to find some of the Flash games that defined an era of the internet best remembered for the sometimes humble contributions of a group of creators motivated largely by passion. </p>
<p> Flash Game Archive </p>
<p> If you’re looking for an alternative to the Flashpoint project, then check out the Flash Game Archives. </p>
<p> Join our mailing list </p>

<p> Subscribe </p>
<p> Flash Game Archives advertises itself as an emulator for the console that Flash games never really had. While its collection of titles isn’t quite as extensive as the one you gain access to via Flashpoint, the program is incredibly smooth and boasts a very friendly interface. </p>
<p> If nothing else, this program is an easy way to take a walk down memory lane. </p>
<p> Ruffle </p>
<p> One of the more interesting potential long-term solutions to the “death” of Flash is a program called Ruffle. </p>
<p> Ruffle is a fascinating project. It’s essentially a Flash emulator designed to allow sites to upload Flash content the way it was “meant” to be experienced: through your browser. It’s still being developed, but Ruffle’s ability to run SWF files either online or offline makes it a surprisingly viable recreation of the basic Flash experience. </p>
<p> Ad </p>
<p> Ad – content continues below </p>
<p> Infamous Flash content website Newgrounds already announced their intentions to use Ruffle to preserve as much Flash content as possible. While Ruffle isn’t necessarily the best “individual user” solution, it’s one of the more intriguing long-term options for the preservation of browser-based Flash content. </p>
<p> Flash Player Projector Content Debugger </p>
<p> The name leaves a lot to be desired, but this program is essentially Adobe’s official way to continue to access Flash files offline. </p>
<p> This simple program allows you to open SWF files or access them directly via web directories. Once you have access to the appropriate files, you’ll be able to run them just as you would have been able to do via an embedded online Flash player. It can also be used as a debug tool (as the name suggests), but the usefulness of that functionality will likely be limited to developers. </p>
<p> Again, the functionality of this tool is limited in the grand scheme of things (and other programs offer easier access to individual games and programs), but it’s one of the more reliable ways to run “Flash files” outside of web browsers. </p>
<p> Game Boy </p>
<p> Flash game creator Anthony Lavelle (perhaps best known for his work on IndestructoTank) has made the unusual decision to preserve his Flash games by porting them to the Game Boy. </p>
<p> While you can play IndestructoTank via a web browser, it is possible to play Lavelle’s Flash ROMs on an actual Game Boy. Granted, the games aren’t 1:1 recreations of the originals (they’ve been redesigned to match the green/black color palette of the original Game Boy, for instance). It’s certainly an unusual way to preserve a Flash game, but some of the best Flash experiences actually feel at home on a platform that was all about maximizing the enjoyability of inherently simple experiences. </p>
<p> Don’t expect too many Flash games to make this leap, but definitely check these ports out if you can. </p>
<p> The Internet Archives </p>
<p> With help from Ruffle, the Internet Archive makes it easy to access an extensive collection of Flash games through your browser. While the Internet Archive’s interface leaves a lot to be desired, the site’s efforts are admirable and the collection of Flash games currently available via this site includes some of the best of all-time. </p>
<p> Flash Game Remakes </p>
<p> This is, by some measure, the least extensive way to access classic Flash games, but it’s undeniably one of the best ways to play some version of the most important Flash games ever made. </p>
<p> Titles like Trials, Alien Hominid, My Friend Pedro, VVVVVV, and Super Meat Boy began their lives as Flash games. While it’s possible to access some of the original Flash versions of these games via some of the methods that we’ve mentioned above, it’s quite remarkable that some of these titles happen to be worthy standalone “full” games despite their seemingly humble origins as Flash titles. </p>
<p> If nothing else, be sure to check out some of the better Flash remakes on markets such as Steam, Google Play, and more if you want a glimpse at how Flash games ultimately changed the industry. </p>

<p> - ERIC CLAPTON </p>
<p> LEARN HOW TO PLAY BASIC GUITAR CHORDS </p>
<p> WHAT ARE CHORD CHARTS? </p>
<p> Chords are a group of notes strummed together to produce a harmonious sound. Chord charts are one way for new guitarists to learn chords. These charts are a visual way to learn which strings and frets are used to form the notes to play a specific chord. They also show you where to place your fingers on the fretboard to strum a particular chord. </p>
<p> Even if you can’t play a lightning fast solo like your favorite guitarist, you can still strum along and play the rhythm parts if you know chords. Learn more about chord charts here. </p>
<p> WHAT ARE SOME EASY CHORDS FOR BEGINNERS? </p>
<p> While there are dozens of chords, some of the most memorable songs have been written using only a handful of easy-to-play open chords. </p>
<p> Listen to Van Morrison’s “Brown-Eyed Girl.” ”Smokey Robinson’s “Tracks of My Tears.” “Clay” by Grace VanderWaal. They all contain some combination of the following chords: </p>
<p> C Major </p>
<p> D Major </p>
<p> G Major </p>
<p> E Minor </p>
<p> Not only are these chords easy to play, they play a major (pun unintended) role in building so many memorable songs. </p>
<p> LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE G AND C CHORDS </p>
<p> Watched the video? Feel more confident about playing chords? Good! Because chords are such an important part of learning to play guitar, we’ve put together a comprehensive hub of free chord lessons. From power chords to minor chords and everything in between, you’ll learn more about the structure behind different types of chords and discover how to play them. </p>
<p> “Sometimes you want to give up the guitar, you’ll hate the guitar. But if you stick with it, you’re gonna be rewarded” </p>
<p> - JIMI HENDRIX </p>
<p> LEARN YOUR FIRST SONG ON GUITAR </p>
<p> One of the main reasons a person picks up a guitar is to play a song they love. Learning your first song is a milestone moment for beginner guitarists. It’s exciting to play along with a song you know and inspires you to keep learning more. </p>
<p> Learning to play your first song on guitar is a micro-education in itself. It gives you an opportunity to apply the chords you’ve learned to a song you enjoy. You get to learn more about the structure of a song and different techniques to make a piece of music come alive. </p>
<p> “She Loves You” by The Beatles includes both the G and C chords you learned in the chord lesson above, plus the E minor chord and an A chord—more easy chords for beginners. Check out the video below to learn how to play “She Loves You” and strum along with a simple chord progression. </p>
<p> HOW TO PLAY "SHE LOVES YOU" BY THE BEATLES </p>
<p> Learning to play your first song on the guitar instills a level of confidence in beginner guitarists. While chords are important, it’s a lot more fun to see what those chords can do when arranged in different ways. With just a few minutes and a few chords, you can begin playing a complete song—from start to finish. Ready to pick up some new tricks and learn more songs? Check out a playlist full of free song lessons below. </p>
<p> LEARN BASIC GUITAR STRUMMING </p>
<p> WHAT ARE STRUMMING PATTERNS? </p>
<p> A strumming pattern is a specific way of playing up and down strokes on your guitar. While a number of songs call for you to strum chords in an alternating pattern—switching between upward and downward strokes, other songs call for an irregular strumming pattern. For instance, an irregular strumming pattern may have you play a chord in an “up-up-down-up” pattern repeatedly. </p>
<p> The more you train your ear to listen to how different a chord sounds when played upwards versus downwards, the easier it will be for you to develop your own internal rhythm and dissect strumming patterns on your own. </p>
<p> Play the free video lesson below and check out the different strum patterns in Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Bad Moon Rising." </p>
<p> STRUM ALONG TO "BAD MOON RISING" BY CREDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL </p>
<p> BEGINNER TIPS FOR GUITAR STRUMMING </p>
<p> Now that you know a little more about strumming, here are some tips for perfecting your technique: </p>
<p> Keep your wrist loose: When you’re strumming a chord, you want your motions to feel fluid. Not hard and choppy. Keeping a loose wrist will not only help your chord progressions sound smoother, but also minimize any potential for wrist pain after a particularly vigorous session. </p>
<p> Angle your pick: In line with keeping your wrist loose, you also want to avoid being too rigid with your pick when strumming. Holding your pick at a slight angle can help you create a more pleasing sound when you strike a chord. </p>
<p> Vary the strength of your strike: It takes a little while to develop your ear, but it also takes time to learn to “feel” the music. With time and practice, you’ll learn when you want to strum a chord with a hard stroke for emphasis, or when to play with soft, light strokes to create a more mellow feel. </p>

<p> - KAKI KING </p>
<p> LEARN TO PLAY BASIC GUITAR SCALES </p>
<p> WHAT ARE GUITAR SCALES </p>
<p> Guitar scales are a series of notes played in ascending or descending order. These notes form a “musical alphabet.” (If you’ve ever heard “Do-Re-Mi,” that’s just the ascending form of the C Major scale, which includes the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.) </p>
<p> Just as the strings on your guitar start with a low E and end with a high E, the notes in a scale begin with a low version of that first note. (In this case, it’s a low C.) And they end with the same note, played one octave higher. (In this instance, it’s a high C.) </p>
<p> Technically, a scale only includes seven notes. However, playing just seven notes leaves it feeling incomplete. The term “octave” contains the Latin root for “eight.” It’s that eighth note—the higher version of the root note for each scale—that makes every scale sound complete. </p>
<p> Check out this short video and learn to play a C major scale—the musical alphabet we just talked about—on your guitar. </p>
<p> HOW TO LEARN THE MUSICAL ALPHABET </p>
<p> WHY LEARN TO PLAY SCALES? </p>
<p> Practicing guitar scales can help you become more familiar with the notes on your fretboard and train your ear to recognize individual notes. You can learn how individual notes sound together and better understand chord composition. Learning to play scales can also help you build speed, dexterity, and finger strength. </p>
<p> There are many more reasons to learn to play scales and a handful of scales that beginners should know. Learning scales can set you on the path to gaining a stronger understanding of music theory and writing your own songs. Better yet, once you learn the rules, you can figure out how to break them. Have fun experimenting with scales! </p>
<p> LEARN FINGER EXERCISES FOR GUITAR </p>
<p> BEGINNER TIPS FOR FINGER EXERCISES </p>
<p> Like scales, exercises can help you learn more about music theory and improve your speed, strength, and dexterity along the fretboard. Here are some examples of finger exercises that you can practice to help you level up: </p>
<p> Practice scales: Practicing a simple C major scale, moving up and down the neck can help make your fingers more nimble. </p>
<p> Play notes slowly, then build speed: Start by playing a series of notes slowly. Allow your fingers to get used to where they should go and which frets they need to land on in order for a note to ring true. Once you feel like you’re hitting each fret with precision, start playing those notes faster. Soon, it’ll be second nature! </p>
<p> Repeat: No matter what you’re learning, play it over and over again. Repetition will ingrain it in your mind and muscle memory. Play those notes. Then play them some more. And then, play them again! </p>
<p> Stretch your fingers: Being able to shred or transition between chords takes practice -- and strong fingers. If you’re a beginner, have small hands, or just want to limber up your fingers, try splaying your fingers out and forming wide “V”s between each of your fingers. This can help you increase your finger span so when you have to stretch across strings, it ain’t no thang! </p>

<p> LEARN BASIC GUITAR TECHNIQUES </p>
<p> HOW GUITAR TECHNIQUES MAKE YOU BETTER </p>
<p> While chords and scales are some of the basic building blocks of musical theory, techniques are important too. They help you play those chords and scales in a way that sounds and feels good. </p>
<p> Learning new guitar skills and techniques can be fun. They allow you to uncover some of the tricks that help make songs sound unique. Different genres make use of different techniques. Practicing them gives you a better appreciation for the skill levels of your own favorite guitarists. </p>
<p> A guitar technique that may sound complicated is usually easier than it seems at first. Guitar techniques can be as simple as learning how to properly fret a note to slightly more complex skills like the hammer-on and pull-off techniques. </p>
<p> LEARN THE HAMMER-ON AND PULL-OFF TECHNIQUES </p>
<p> Hammer-ons and pull-offs are a two-step technique on your fretboard. To try it, bring your finger down hard and fast on the appropriate fret and then pull it away. This sounds the note in a subtle, yet effective way. It’s a common technique, whether you’re a fan of folk, hard rock or heavy metal. </p>
<p> Watch this quick video to learn the hammer-on and pull-off technique. Then start listening for it in some of your favorite songs and practicing it on your own! </p>
<p> HOW TO PLAY HAMMER-ONS AND PULL-OFFS </p>
<p> THAT'S A WRAP </p>
<p> HOW DO YOU FEEL? </p>
<p> Now that we’ve gone through a series of guitar basics, do you feel more confident in your ability to learn to play guitar? The principles covered here apply to both acoustic or electric guitar and can be built upon over time. Take it note by note, chord by chord and you’ll discover that learning to play guitar is a lot easier than you think. </p>
<p> Practicing and repeating simple chords, scales, and exercises can help you build your confidence and skill level. Repeat these free lessons as many times as you like. And if you want to learn more, Fender Play gives you access to more lessons to help you get playing songs you love even faster. </p>
<p> REMEMBER: </p>
<p> Chords are a cornerstone of your guitar education. Many songs contain simple chords such as the C, D, G, and E minor chords. </p>
<p> Strumming patterns and accents can help make chord progressions sound more dynamic and exciting. </p>
<p> Many of your favorite songs contain just three or four simple chords. Better yet, you can learn to play a song in just minutes. </p>
<p> Scales are a great way to train your ear and help you deconstruct the notes in songs and chords. </p>
<p> Practicing finger exercises are a great way to build speed, strength, dexterity, and accuracy. </p>
<p> Even guitar techniques that seem complicated—like the hammer-on and pull-off—can be easy to execute with a little practice. </p>

<p> How to Play Mahjong With the Basic Rules </p>
<p> Setup, Play, and Scoring </p>
<p> Seth is a freelance writer specializing in gameplay and strategies, and is also author of "The Little Book of Mahjong." </p>
<p> Mahjong is a popular Chinese game played with sets of tiles. Like many popular games, mahjong has many regional variations, from the Chinese prevailing wind system to American mahjong with special bingo-like scoring cards. These rules will focus on the most basic rules of mahjong, which are the same across most other variants. </p>
<p> 1:15 </p>
<p> How to Play Mahjong </p>
<p> Players </p>
<p> The basic game is played with four players. There are variants with three players. </p>
<p> Components </p>
<p> The basic game has 136 tiles, including 36 characters, 36 bamboos, and 36 circles, which are the suits. These are, in turn, divided into four sets of numbers 1 to 9 in each suit. There are also 16 wind tiles and 12 dragon tiles. Many sets also include eight bonus tiles with four flowers and four seasons, but these are not needed in the basic game. </p>
<p> One pair of dice is used to determine the deal. It is optional to have four racks. </p>
<p> Goal </p>
<p> The goal of the game is to get a mahjong, which consists of getting all 14 of your tiles into four sets and one pair. A pair is two identical tiles. A set can either be a "pung," which is three identical tiles, or a "chow," which is a run of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. A single tile cannot be used in two sets at once. </p>
<p> Setup </p>
<p> Determine a starting dealer. In Chinese tradition, the four wind tiles are shuffled face down and dealt to the players. Players then sit according to their tile and sit clockwise in the order north, west, south, east. East starts as the dealer. Modern players may simply roll the dice to determine the dealer. </p>
<p> All tiles are shuffled together, and the players build a wall of 34 face-down tiles in front of themselves, 17 tiles long and two tiles high. The result should be a large square wall of tiles in the center of the table. </p>
<p> The dealer rolls the dice and counts that many tiles from the right edge of their wall, and separates the wall at that point to begin dealing tiles from the left of that spot and going clockwise. Each player receives 13 tiles, with the dealer starting with an extra 14th tile. </p>
<p> Each player then arranges their own tiles so they can see them and other players cannot. Racks are often used for this purpose. The dealer then discards one tile, and play begins to the left of the dealer. </p>
<p> Play </p>
<p> Before your turn, you must give other players a few seconds to claim the most recently discarded tile. </p>
<p> The first priority goes to any player who can claim the discarded tile to complete a mahjong. A player who can do this claims the tile, then reveals the winning hand of 14 tiles. </p>
<p> Failing that, any player can claim the discarded tile to complete a pung. The player says "pung", and then reveals the two matching tiles that match the discard. For example, if the discarded tile was the 7 of bamboo, and the player had two more bamboo 7s on the rack, that player would call "pung". When calling pung, a player turns the completed pung (with all three bamboo 7s, in this case) face-up, discards a different tile, and the turn passes to the right. </p>
<p> If nobody claims the discarded tile but it completes a chow for you, you may claim it at the beginning of your turn by saying "chow". You then must turn your chow face-up, revealing the completed run (e.g. 5, 6, 7 of bamboo) as in the pung example above. You then discard a different tile and play continues as normal. </p>
<p> If the discard does not complete a set for you, then on your turn you draw the next tile from the wall (going left). Unless this gives you a mahjong, you then discard a tile face-up. </p>
<p> Note that only the most recently discarded tile can be claimed. </p>
<p> Kong </p>
<p> Some players also play with a "Kong", which is four of the same tile (like an extended pung). The same rules for claiming a discarded tile apply, but any player completing a kong immediately draws an extra tile before discarding. </p>
<p> Hand End </p>
<p> The hand ends when somebody declares mahjong and reveals a complete 14-tile hand of four sets and a pair. </p>
<p> If nobody has revealed a mahjong by the time the wall runs out of tiles, the game is considered a draw and the dealer redeals. </p>
<p> Scoring </p>
<p> Simple scoring awards one point to whoever achieved the mahjong and won the hand. </p>
<p> Many more complex scoring arrangements exist, which vary widely by region. Bonus point-scoring awards an additional point for not winning by taking a discard, or winning with the last tile in the game, or having a pung of dragons. Exponential scoring scores each pung at 2 points, which is doubled if the pung was not revealed, doubled if the pung used ones or nines, and doubled twice more if the pung was a kong. </p>
<p> Due to the many scoring variations, players should be careful to agree on scoring rules before a game. </p>
<p> Game End </p>
<p> Players play to a pre-determined number of points, or 16 rounds, or until players agree that they are done. </p>

<p> How Kids Learn to Play: 6 Stages of Play Development </p>
<p> Play is all about having fun! Any activity, organized or unstructured, your child finds fun and enjoyable is considered play. But play is much more than just a fun activity for your child! As a child grows they go through different stages of play development. </p>
<p> While playing, children learn and develop important skills they will continue to use throughout their lifetime. Problem solving, creativity, and willingness to take risks are just a few of the skills developed through play. </p>
<p> Is your child under 2 years old? Enter your baby’s birthday to get weekly activities to help meet developmental milestones. </p>
<p> Children who use their imagination and ‘play pretend’ in safe environments are able to learn about their emotions, what interests them, and how to adapt to situations. When children play with each other, they are given the opportunity to learn how to interact with others and behave in various social situations. Learn more about your child’s social-emotional development. </p>
<p> Be sure to give your child plenty of time and space to play. There are 6 stages of play during early childhood, all of which are important for your child’s development. All of the stages of play involve exploring, being creative, and having fun. This list explains how children’s play changes by age as they grow and develop social skills. </p>
<p> Unoccupied Play (Birth-3 Months) At this stage baby is just making a lot of movements with their arms, legs, hands, feet, etc. They are learning about and discovering how their body moves. </p>
<p> Solitary Play (Birth-2 Years) This is the stage when a child plays alone. They are not interested in playing with others quite yet. </p>
<p> Spectator/Onlooker Behavior (2 Years) During this stage a child begins to watch other children playing but does not play with them. </p>
<p> Parallel Play (2+ Years) When a child plays alongside or near others but does not play with them this stage is referred to as parallel play. </p>
<p> Associate Play (3-4 Years) When a child starts to interact with others during play, but there is not a large amount of interaction at this stage. A child might be doing an activity related to the kids around him, but might not actually be interacting with another child. For example, kids might all be playing on the same piece of playground equipment but all doing different things like climbing, swinging, etc. </p>
<p> When a child plays together with others and has interest in both the activity and other children involved in playing they are participating in cooperative play. </p>
<p> Play starts when we are babies, but it does not stop there! Including play in your child’s daily routine and giving them time to play is important for their development at every age.

<p> Pay-to-play, sometimes pay-for-play or P2P, is a phrase used for a variety of situations in which money is exchanged for services or the privilege to engage in certain activities. The common denominator of all forms of pay-to-play is that one must pay to "get in the game", with the sports analogy frequently arising.[1] </p>
<p> The term also refers to a growing trend in which individuals or groups may purchase radio or television airtime, much like infomercials, to broadcast content promoting the payer’s interests. While these types of shows are typically shows that have little sponsor support and have no substantiated audience, some major program producers do purchase airtime to "clear" their programs in certain major markets.[citation needed] This type of format is particularly common among religious broadcasters (televangelism), where the related term pay-for-pray is used.[2] </p>
<p> Pay-to-play is a provision in a corporation's charter documents (usually inserted as part of a preferred stock financing) that requires stockholders to participate in subsequent stock offerings in order to benefit from certain antidilution protections. If the stockholder does not purchase his or her pro rata share in the subsequent offering, then the stockholder loses the benefit(s) of the antidilution provisions. In extreme cases, investors who do not participate in subsequent rounds must convert to common stock, thereby losing the protective provisions of the preferred stock. This approach minimizes the fears of major investors that small or minority investors will benefit by having the major investors continue providing needed equity, particularly in troubled economic circumstances for the company. It is considered a "harsh" provision that is usually only inserted when one party has a strong bargaining position. </p>
<p> Pay-to-play in the engineering, design, and construction industry can refer to: </p>
<p> monetary and gift exchanges to persuade decision makers such that they make decisions in favor of those offering the money or gifts; </p>
<p> exchanges of money or gifts and providing sponsorships such that the engineering, design, or construction company gets considered for work that would not otherwise be available (this in essence becomes a type of pre-qualification for work—contracts; and </p>
<p> illegal acts of bribery. </p>
<p> Pay-to-play might also be used to explain the appearance of engineering, design, and construction public work being done not in an open and fair manner. </p>
<p> In the finance industry, the term pay-to-play describes the practice of giving gifts to political figures in the hopes of receiving investment business in return. </p>
<p> In the U.S., after discovering that this practice was not uncommon and was undermining the integrity of the financial markets, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) severely regulated and limited the interactions and gifts-giving practices between the investment industry personnel and politicians and candidates. This can be seen most notably in Rule 206(4)-5 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules G-37 and G-38 of the MSRB Rule Book.[3] </p>
<p> Pay-to-play occurs when investment firms or their employees make campaign contributions to politicians or candidates for office in the hope of receiving business from the municipalities that those political figures represent. It usually applies to investment banking firms that hope to receive municipal securities underwriting business in return or to investment management firms that hope to be selected for the management of government funds such as state pension funds. </p>
<p> The term also refers to a growing trend, where venue owners charge an up-front fee to performing artists for the use of their facilities. The practice began in Los Angeles, California, during the 1980s. It has become common in many U.S. cities at low-turnout all-ages shows where performers are required to guarantee a minimum attendance through pre-show ticket sales.[6] Pay-to-play gigs are a contentious practice in the UK, and some of the largest pay-to-play gig organisers have generated large amounts of discussion and criticism.[7] </p>
<p> The term pay-to-play was also used as the title to a song by the band Nirvana (later renamed to "Stay Away"). The refrain referred to the practice of a band or their record label paying radio stations to put a song into heavy rotation. The phrase is also the title to a song by the band Cringer, in which they denounce the practice. </p>
<p> Music Supervision is a booming field in the music industry, whose professionals place music in many kinds of film, television, commercial, web-based and other live and recorded media cues. While some music supervisors are paid only by their employer or per-project, some companies use a pay-to-play model wherein artists pay to submit tracks for consideration to a variety of media concerns, only to have to pay the Music Supervision intermediary again at a cost of half of its earning for the track placement should it win a placement. </p>
<p> The term is also used as slang to refer to Internet services that require that users pay to use them. Usually, it refers to MMORPGs, where players must pay to maintain a playing account, as is the case with Eve Online or World of Warcraft. This is in contrast to free-to-play games. Many formerly pay-to-play MMORPGs have switched to a free-to-play model, including EverQuest, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Aion: The Tower of Eternity, and The Lord of the Rings Online. The game RuneScape features both free accounts for no money or pay-to-play accounts, with a much larger list of features. </p>
<p> The term may also refer to something like the online game Habbo Hotel, where there are games inside the game, which you may pay-to-play to join into a game whilst it is in progress. </p>
<p> In politics, pay-to-play refers to a system, akin to payola in the music industry, by which one pays (or must pay) money to become a player. </p>
<p> Typically, the payer (an individual, business, or organization) makes campaign contributions to public officials, party officials, or parties themselves, and receives political or pecuniary benefit such as no-bid government contracts, influence over legislation,[8][9] political appointments or nominations,[10][11] special access[12] or other favors. The contributions, less frequently, may be to nonprofit or institutional entities,[13] or may take the form of some benefit to a third party, such as a family member of a governmental official.[14] </p>
<p> The phrase, almost always used in criticism, also refers to the increasing cost of elections and the "price of admission" just to run for office and the concern "that one candidate can far outspend his opponents, essentially buying the election".[15] </p>
<p> While the direct exchange of campaign contributions for contracts is the most visible form of pay-to-play, the greater concern is the central role of money in politics, and its skewing of both the composition and the policies of government.[16][17] Thus, those who can pay the price of admission, such as to a $1000/plate dinner or $25,000 "breakout session", gain access to power and/or its spoils, to the exclusion of those who cannot or will not pay: "giving certain people advantages that other[s] don't have because they donated to your campaign".[18] Good-government advocates consider this an outrage because "political fundraising should have no relationship to policy recommendations".[19] Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Washington called the "pay-to-play Congress" one of the top 10 scandals of 2008.[20] </p>
<p> Incumbent candidates and their political organizations[21] are typically the greatest beneficiaries of pay-to-play. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have been criticized for the practice. Many seeking to ban or restrict the practice characterize pay-to-play as legalized corruption. </p>
<p> The opposite of a pay-to-play system is one that is "fair and open"; the New Jersey Pay-to-Play Act specifically sets out bid processes that are or are not considered fair and open, depending upon who has contributed what to whom.[22] </p>
<p> Because of individual federal campaign contribution limits in the wake of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold), pay-to-play payments of "soft money" (money not contributed directly to candidate campaigns and that does not "expressly advocate" election or defeat of a candidate) donations to state parties and county committees have come under greater scrutiny. This method refers to money that is donated to an intermediary with a higher contribution limit, which in turn donates money to individual candidates or campaign committees who could not directly accept the payor's funds. </p>
<p> Pay-to-Play practices have come under scrutiny by both the federal government[23] and a number of states.[24] In Illinois, federal prosecutors in 2006 were investigating "pay-to-play allegations that surround Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's administration".[25] The allegations of pay-to-play in Illinois became a national scandal after the arrest of Gov. Blagojevich in December 2008, on charges that, among other things, he and a staffer attempted to "sell" the vacated U.S. Senate seat of then-president-elect Barack Obama.[26][27] </p>
<p> Many agencies have been created to regulate and control campaign contributions. Furthermore, many third-party government "watchdog" groups have formed to monitor campaign donations and make them more transparent. </p>
<p> In a series of academic research articles, Christopher Cotton shows how selling access may lead to better policy decisions compared to other means of awarding access.[28] He also illustrates how wealthy interest groups are not necessarily better off from having better access to politicians.[29] </p>
<p> The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has created a rule that puts some restrictions on asset managers when they make campaign contributions. The New York and Tennessee Republican parties filed a lawsuit against the SEC in August over the 2010 rule, arguing that it impedes free speech, seeking a preliminary injunction against the rule. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell questioned whether the parties have standing to bring the case, noting they failed to name the potential donors and did not cite any investment advisers who are upset about the rule.[30] </p>
<p> In a pay-to-play gig, the performer will either pay the promoter some money to be allowed to perform at the show, or will have to offer some in-kind payment. In a conventional comedy club, the promoter will pay the acts for their performance, and will raise the money to stage the gig by charging the audience. Some clubs offer open mic slots, where newer acts are allowed to learn the craft, unpaid; this is not the same as pay-to-play. Many comedians are against pay-to-play schemes, which they consider exploitative.[31] </p>
<p> Pay-to-play was cited as a cause of major damage to the quality of the New York comedy scene.[32] In economic terms, a pay-to-play strategy elevates those people who can afford to perform for nothing, or can afford to pay for their stage-time, which has nothing to do with their quality as an act. The pay-to-play promoter is able to profit from the goodwill and desire to perform of the acts, while discouraging appearances by those who cannot afford to perform without payment. </p>
<p> In some shows, the performer is asked to bring a certain number of paying audience members. As a payment in kind policy, this has caused similar controversy to pay-to-play.[33] A show where the acts are obliged to bring the audience is called a bringer.[31] </p>
<p> Similar to the trend cited above in music, pay-to-play is the practice of visual artists paying gallery owners, dealers, curators, publishers, festival and contest sponsors, and better-established artists to critique, review, judge, exhibit, collect, or publish works created in such disparate media as painting, photography, video, and sculpture. Pay-to-play is a type of vanity gallery. Pay-to-play is characterized by cash flow that moves away from visual artists. Pay-to-play is sold to visual artists and justified by visual artists as "an investment in future sales"[34] and may be self-victimization.[35] </p>

Game refers to a recreational contest, mental or physical, usually governed by set rules: a game of chess. Besides referring to an individual contest, game may refer to a pastime as a whole: Golf is a good game.

<p> play (v.) </p>
<p> Middle English pleien, from Old English plegan, plegian "move lightly and quickly, occupy or busy oneself, amuse oneself; engage in active exercise; frolic; engage in children's play; make sport of, mock; perform music," from Proto-West Germanic *plegōjanan "occupy oneself about" (source also of Old Saxon plegan "vouch for, take charge of," Old Frisian plega "tend to," Middle Dutch pleyen "to rejoice, be glad," German pflegen "take care of, cultivate"), which is apparently connected to the root of plight (v.), but the ultimate etymology is uncertain and the phonetic development is difficult to explain. </p>
<p> Meaning "to take part in" a martial or athletic game is from c. 1200. It has been opposed to work (v.) since late 14c. Meaning "perform or act on the stage" (transitive) is by late 14c., as are the senses of "take the role of" and "make a pretense of, make believe" and "act thoughtlessly or wantonly."

Sense of "operate or cause to operate with continuous or repeated action" is from 1590s. Meaning "to cause (a recording) to reproduce what is on it" is by 1903, probably from the "make music" sense. Related: Played; playing. </p>
<p> Many expressions are from the stage, sports and games, or music, and it is not always easy to say which is from which. To play up "emphasize" is from 1909 (perhaps originally "play music more vigorously"); to play down "minimize" is from 1930; to play along "pretend to agree or cooperate" is from 1929. To play fair "be nice" is from mid-15c. To play house as a children's activity is from 1958. </p>

To play into the hands (of someone) "act in such a way as to give the advantage to one's opponent or a third party" is from 1705. For play the _______ card see card (n.1). For play the field see field (n.). To play with oneself "masturbate" is from 1896 (to play with "have sexual intercourse with" is from mid-13c.). Playing-card "one of a pack of cards used for playing games" is from 1540s. </p>
<p> play (n.) </p>
<p> Middle English pleie, from Old English plega (West Saxon), plæga (Anglian) "quick motion; recreation, exercise, any brisk activity" (the latter sense preserved in swordplay -- Old English sweordplegan -- etc.), from or related to Old English plegan (see play (v.)). </p>
<p> By early Middle English it could mean variously, "a game, a martial sport, activity of children, joke or jesting, revelry, sexual indulgence." Of physical things, "rapid, brisk, or light movement," by 1620s. </p>
<p> Meaning "dramatic performance" is attested by early 14c., perhaps late Old English. Meaning "free or unimpeded movement, liberty and room for action," of mechanisms, etc., is from 1650s. The meaning "activity, operation" (1590s) is behind expressions such as in full play, come into play. The sporting sense of "the playing of a game" is attested from mid-15c.; that of "specific maneuver or attempt" is from 1868. </p>
<p> The U.S. slang meaning "attention, publicity" is by 1929. To be in play (of a hit ball, etc.) is from 1788. Play-by-play in reference to running commentary on a game is attested from 1927. Play on words "pun" is from 1798. Play-money is attested from 1705 as "money won in gambling," by 1920 as "pretend money." </p>

<p> Roleplaying is a fun way to express your creativity in a social setting. You and your friends can gather in person or online, roleplay a tabletop game, create your favorite characters, or anything else you can imagine. Learn how to play like a pro by setting up your game, choosing a character, and learning how to make moves. </p>
<p> Decide which game you want to play. You can play a commercially-sold tabletop RPG like Dungeons and Dragons or Vampire: The Masquerade, or an online version like Star Wars: The Old Republic. You can also start your own roleplaying game--it's up to you! Your game should be something you're interested in and that you know other people would like to play.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> If you don't want to buy a game, try setting up your own roleplaying game based on fictional characters, history, or even completely imaginary characters and settings. </p>
<p> Find a group of like-minded players. Roleplaying is a social activity, so once you've decided what you want to focus on, it's time to find two or three other people interested in the same thing. Ask your friends or search online--there are lots of RPGs that are done completely online. </p>
<p> You can also visit your local gaming or hobby shop for regular roleplaying meetups. </p>
<p> Choose a rulebook or determine your rules. If you'll be using a commercial RPG, all you need to decide is which rulebook you're going to follow. If you are making up your own game, it's important to set up some ground rules first so that everybody knows what to do.[2] X Research source </p>
<p> If you'll be using a rulebook, you can buy them online or at game shops. Sometimes a game will have multiple rulebooks, so ask for recommendations or read online reviews to determine which will be best for your roleplay. </p>
<p> If you're making up your own game, think about what kind of limits there should be. Can players rise from the dead, fly, or disappear? If you're playing a fanfiction or historical roleplay, can they act completely different from the original character? Will you allow players to go again or start over with a new character if they've made a mistake? </p>
<p> It might be helpful to write the rules down so everyone knows them. </p>
<p> Decide who your gamemaster will be. The gamemaster enforces the game rules and describes the effects of each player's turn. Usually, the gamemaster is whoever knows the rules of the game best. In some games, the gamemaster is actually responsible for devising the storylines, so check your rules before choosing. </p>
<p> Make sure you have all the supplies. Some games require nothing but pen and paper, but others might need dice, a game board, or even props and costumes. Check your rules and make sure you've got everything you need. </p>
<p> Choose a regular time to play. If you can, try to pick a weekly or monthly meeting time for everybody to get together and play. It's much easier to have a long-term game if there's a regular time for it! Be sure to ask each player what their schedule looks like.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> You can have the meeting at the same place, or rotate between your houses. You can also do all of your roleplaying entirely online. </p>
<p> Choose a character from the game list. If your game comes with pre-set characters, choose your favorite or the one you identify with most. If you have your heart set on a specific character, let the other players know beforehand.[4] X Research source </p>
<p> Many character lists are divided by class--warriors, wizards, healers, and similar categories. If you don't have a favorite, check out their stats and see if any class in particular appeals to you. </p>
<p> Make up your own character. If your game has room for an imaginary character, think about what you'd like your character to be. What kind of character you'll choose will depend on what kind of game you're playing. Sorcerers are great for medieval fantasy games, while aliens would be better for a Star Trek roleplay.[5] X Research source </p>
<p> Pick your character's strengths and weaknesses. Every roleplaying character has a set of strengths and a set of weaknesses, and they should balance each other out. Nobody will want to play with you if your character is immortal and can never be hurt or tricked, but you won't enjoy the game if your character is so weak they die every round.[6] X Research source </p>
<p> Think about any drawbacks of your character choices. For example, your werewolf character might be stronger and scarier than your friend's vampire, but you'll only be able to use it if there's a full moon in the game. </p>
<p> Choose your character's accessories. If your character has a weapon, armor, magic bag, or anything else than can affect the game, make sure you tell the other players about it first. You should also devise an attack or hit level the accessories give your character. </p>
<p> For example, if your character has a pocketknife and a sword, the sword should be able to cause more damage than the knife. Or if your character carries a healing potion, determine if it can bring people back from the dead or just cure minor wounds. </p>
<p> Wait for the gamemaster to tell you what to do. The gamemaster sets up the scene and decides who goes first. If you're playing from a guidebook or manual, this will be predetermined, but if it's a game you devised, they can pick anything. </p>
<p> Make an opening move that advances the story. If you go first, think about the setting and devise a move that helps move the story forward. If you're in space, you probably aren't going to meet a pack of wolves, but that might be an appropriate move if you're in medieval England![7] X Research source </p>
<p> Making your first move an attack is a good way to get the action going and get the other players interested. </p>
<p> For example, instead of choosing something like “My sorcerer looks up a spell in his book,” try “My sorcerer casts a spell of blindness on your wizard.” </p>
<p> Roll the dice to determine what happens (optional). Some roleplaying games make you roll a dice to determine the importance of your play. If your game doesn't have dice, be prepared to talk about exactly what effect your play has on the game! </p>
<p> React to other players' moves. In many games, the gamemaster will determine the effects of each play. In others, players react to each other's plays immediately. If you aren't the first, it's easiest to base your move off of what the last player did. For example, if they said that a dragon appeared in the sky, you can say something like “The dragon breathes fire onto the village” or “My hunter shoots three arrows at the dragon.” Depending on your game, either the gamemaster or the next player will determine the results.[8] X Research source </p>
<p> Start a new scenario. If you want to move the game in a different direction, you can! Try starting a brand new scenario within your game. For example, if you are currently on a quest to find a treasure, you can have a wizard appear asking your group to save a princess first.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> Don't start too many subplots--it can make the game too confusing to follow. </p>
<p> Pause the game when time is up. Part of the fun of roleplaying is telling a continuous story. You don't need to wind up the entire story when game time comes to an end. Be sure to write down the last few moves so you can pick up where you started next time.[10] X Research source </p>
<p> If you feel like the storyline isn't going anywhere or you'd like to start something new, that's fine too! </p>

<p> The fact that people have been playing Backgammon for over 5,000 years is proof enough that it’s really fun. It's actually one of the oldest board games! The game looks complicated at first, but it’s surprisingly easy once you get the hang of it. Read on to learn everything you need to know about playing Backgammon, like how to set up the game, the rules of play, and how to win. </p>
<p> Understand the backgammon board. Backgammon is played on a board that consists of 24 narrow triangles that are called points. The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. There are four types of quadrants: the player's home board and outer board, and the opponent's home board and outer board. The intersection of these four quadrants, the middle of the board, is separated by a ridge called the bar.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> The players sit facing each other at opposite sides of the board when they play. Each player's home board is positioned on the right quadrant closest to the player. The home boards are opposite each other, and so are the outer boards, which are located in the left quadrant. </p>
<p> The player moves his checkers from the direction of the other player's home board in a horse-shoe like direction, moving counterclockwise. </p>
<p> The triangles are numbered from 1-24 in most of the Backgammon boards, with the 24th point being the furthest point from the player, and with 1 being the right most triangle on the player's home court. The players must move their pieces from opposite sides of the board, so one player's 1st point is the other player's 24th point, one player's 2nd point is the other player's 23rd point, and so on. </p>
<p> Set up the board. Each player must set up his 15 checkers for the game to begin. The players' checkers will be comprised of two distinct colors, traditionally white and red, or white and black but it can also be other colors. To set up the board, each player must place two checkers on their 24 point, three checkers on his 8 point, five checkers on his 13 point, and five more checkers on his 6 point.[2] X Research source </p>
<p> Remember that each player has his own numbering system, so the checkers will not overlap. </p>
<p> Roll a die to determine who goes first. The player who rolls the highest number will go first. If both players roll the same number, roll again. The numbers rolled will count as the first moves for the player with the highest number. For example, if one player rolled a 5 and the other rolled a 2, then the player who rolled the 5 would go first and use the 5 and 2 in lieu of a new dice roll.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> Remember that you can double the stakes at any time. In backgammon, the winner doesn't gain points, but the loser loses points. So if you win, the opponent will either lose based on the face value, double value, or triple value of the stakes on the doubling cube. The doubling cube isn't a die but a marker. It starts at 1, but you can raise the stakes at any time at the beginning of your turn before you have rolled the dice.[4] X Research source </p>
<p> If you want to double the stakes and your partner accepts, then the cube is turned to the new number and placed in your opponent's court. He will have ownership of the cube and will be able to propose a doubling during any of his future turns. </p>
<p> If your opponent does not accept your offer, he must forfeit the game and lose by the original stakes. </p>
<p> You can keep doubling the stakes back and forth, or redoubling, but it's not traditionally done more than three or four times in a game. </p>
<p> Roll the dice. Use a dice tumbler to roll two six-sided dice once during each of your turns. The numbers rolled represent two separate moves. For example, if you roll a 3 and a 5, you can move one checker three spaces and another checker 5 spaces. Or, you can move one checker 3 spaces and then 5 more spaces.[5] X Research source </p>
<p> Make sure that you roll the dice to the right of your side of the board, from a reasonable height so that they bounce and roll a bit. </p>
<p> If either of the dice lands on a checker, outside of the board, or leaning against the edge of the board, then it is not considered valid and you will have to reroll. </p>
<p> Move your checkers to an open point. An open point is any point on the board that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers. You can move your checkers to a point with no checkers on it, a point with one or more of your checkers on it, or a point with one of your opponent's checkers on it. Remember that you should always move your checkers counter-clockwise, moving from your opponent's home court to your own.[6] X Research source </p>
<p> You can start with any checker you chose, but it is a good idea to get your checkers out of your opponent's home board as soon as possible. </p>
<p> You only need 2 checkers to block a point, but you can have as many of your checkers as you want on a single point. </p>
<p> Remember that you can either move one checker twice or move two checkers once. For example, if you roll a 3-2, you can move one checker 3 points over and then 2 points over, as long as it lands on an open point both times. Alternately, you can move one checker 2 points over to an open point, and move another checker 3 points over to an open point. </p>
<p> Play the numbers on the dice twice if you roll doubles. If you roll the same number on both dice, then you've earned yourself two extra moves. If you roll double 3s, for example, then you can make four moves of 3 points each.[7] X Research source </p>
<p> Again, you can move four checkers 3 times, move one checker 12 times if it lands on an open point after every move, or mix it up and move two checkers 6 times, or one checker 3 times and another checker 9 times. As long as the total moves add up to 12 and each move lands in an open point, you're in good shape. </p>
<p> Lose your turn if you can't play either number. For example, if you roll a 5-6, but you can't find an open point when moving any checker either 5 or 6 times, then you lose your turn. If you can only play one of the numbers, then you can play that number and lose your turn on the other number. If you can only play one number or the other, then you have to play the higher number.[8] X Research source </p>
<p> This rule applies even if you roll doubles. If you can't play the doubled number you've rolled, you lose your turn. </p>
<p> Keep your checkers safe. Try to avoid having just one of your checkers on a point because the point, which is called a blot, is vulnerable to being “hit” by your player's checkers. If one of your checker's gets hit, then it will go to the bar and you will have to use your next turn to roll and try to reenter the board in your opponent's home board. Do your best to keep at least two of your checkers on a point, at least early in the game. </p>
<p> Try to dominate the board. Before you start moving your pieces into your home court, you should try to have many points occupied by 2 or 3 checkers instead of just a few points occupied by 5 or 6 checkers. This will not only give you more options to move to open points, but will also make it harder for your opponent to move to an open point.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> Hit a blot to move your opponent's checkers to the bar. If you hit a blot, a point occupied by just one of your opponent's checkers, then the opponent's checkers will be placed on the bar. You should try to hit the blots whenever possible, as long as it helps you move your pieces as close to your home court as possible. This is a great way to slow down your opponent.[10] X Research source </p>
<p> Any time a player's checker is on the bar, he can't move his other checkers until he gets the bar checker back on the home board. </p>
<p> Enter your pieces when they are taken out. If a player hits a blot with one of your pieces on it, then you have to place your own checker on your bar. Your task is now to move that checker back onto the opposing home board. You can do this by rolling the dice and then moving the checker onto an open point on your opponent's home board, if you roll an open number. If you do not roll an open number, then you lose your turn and you will have to try again on your next turn.[11] X Research source </p>
<p> For example, if you roll a 2, you can enter your piece on the 23 mark on your opponent's home court, provided that it's open. This is because you're moving your checker two points over from the bar. </p>
<p> You may not use the sum of the two numbers to choose a space. For example, if you roll a 6 and a 2, you cannot add them and move your piece onto the 8th point. You can only move your checker onto the 6th or the 2nd point to reenter. </p>
<p> Move your other checkers after you have gotten all of your checker(s) off the bar. Once you get your checker(s) off the bar and back onto the board, you can move your other checkers again. If you only had one checker to enter, then you can use the other number that you rolled to move one of your other checkers.[12] X Research source </p>
<p> If you have two checkers on the bar, you have to enter them both before you can move any other checkers. If you can only enter one checker during a dice roll, then you will have to try again on your next turn. </p>
<p> If you have more than two checkers on the bar, you can only move your other checkers once all the checkers on the bar are entered. </p>
<p> Understand how to win the game. To win the game, you need to be the first one to bear off, or remove, all of your checkers from the board and into your tray. To bear off your checkers, you need to roll both dice and use the numbers to move pieces into the tray. The numbers you roll must be exact or higher than the number of spaces needed to remove each piece from the board.[13] X Research source </p>
<p> For example, if you roll a 6-2, you can bear off two pieces that are on these points. But if you do not have a checker on the 6 point, you can bear it off from the next highest point on your board, such as the 5th or 4th point. </p>
<p> Move all of your checkers into your home court. You can only start bearing off your checkers once they are all in your home court. To begin bearing off, get all of your checkers into the 1-6 points on your board. They can be placed on any of these points. Don't forget that your checkers are still vulnerable when they're in your own home court.[14] X Research source </p>
<p> If the opposing player has a checker on the bar, then he can still enter it into a blot on your court if you have any, forcing you to take out one of your pieces and move it to the bar. After that, you can't continue bearing off until it's back in the home court. </p>
<p> Start bearing off your checkers. When bearing off, you can only bear off checkers that occupy the corresponding point. For example, if you rolled a 4-1, and you have a checker in the 4th and 1st point, you can bear them off. If your roll double sixes and have four checkers on the 6th point, you can bear off all six.[15] X Research source </p>
<p> If you still have a die to play and no checker to bear off, you must move a checker according to the number on the die. For example, if you only have two checkers remaining in the 6th and 5th points and you roll a 2-1, then you can move the checker on the 6th point over to the 4th point, and the checker on the 5th point over to the 4th point. </p>
<p> You can use a higher roll to bear off a die on a lower point. If you roll a 5-4 and you only have a few checkers remaining in the 3rd and 2nd points, you can bear off two of these checkers. </p>
<p> You must move a lower die roll before a higher one even if it means you can't fully use the full value of a die. For example, if you have a checker in the 5 point and roll a 5-1, you must first move the checker over 1 to the 4 point and then bear it off using the 5 value. </p>
<p> Bear off all fifteen of your checkers. If you bear off all fifteen of your checkers before your opponent does, then you have won the game of backgammon. But not all wins are created equal. Your opponent can lose in one of three ways:[16] X Research source </p>
<p> A regular loss. This happens if you bore off all of your checkers first while your opponent was trying to bear off his checkers. Your opponent will lose only the value on the doubling cube. </p>
<p> The gammon. If you bear off all of your checkers before your opponent bears off any of his, he is gammoned and loses twice the value on the doubling cube. </p>
<p> The backgammon. If you bore off all of your checkers while your opponent still has checkers on the bar or your home court, then your opponent is backgammon and loses three times the value on the doubling cube. </p>
<p> Play again. Backgammon is meant to be played more than once, since each game is worth a certain amount of points. You can even set a goal to play until the losing player loses a certain amount of points.[17] X Research source </p>
<p> If you want to keep playing more games but can't do it in one sitting, you can keep a tally of the points lost by each player and return to the game at another time. </p>

<p> Community Q&A </p>
<p> If you are playing for fun, you don't have to use the doubling cube because you aren't playing for points. </p>
<p> At the start of a game or match, how is it decided who plays black and who plays white, and does this ever change? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Tournament rules state that disagreements over this and similar preferences can be determined by rolling dice, with the high roller getting his first choice. </p>
<p> As many as you want, as long as the slot doesn't contain the opponent's 2 or more pieces. </p>
<p> What do I do with the checkers that start off in my homeboard? </p>
<p> Silphaer </p>
<p> Top Answerer </p>
<p> Just leave them there. You can't move them out of your inner table, the only way they can get it is if they're placed on the bar by an opponents man (aka checker). </p>
<p> It depends. If you're rolling a 1 or a 2 as your first move, 13-11 and 6-5 will be the best. </p>
<p> Can I choose not to bear off an exposed checker and move the exposed checker? </p>
<p> Silphaer </p>
<p> Top Answerer </p>
<p> You can only start bearing off men (aka checkers) once you have all your men in your inner table. Once you do have that it's probably better to try and bear them all off, because the first person to have all their pieces beared off is the person who wins. However, you can choose to move it instead of bearing it off. </p>
<p> I moved my markers incorrectly to the number rolled and it wasn't discovered until my opponent had rolled (but not played). Is it too late for me to place my markers in the correct spot? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> There is no technical rule about this, so you have to decide between yourself and the other player whether you think that would be fair. Usually moves are set in stone, but if you can easily figure out and undo everything that has been affected by the false move, ask your opponent if it's OK with them. </p>
<p> It is difficult if you are a beginner, but you will get the hang of it the more that you practice. </p>
<p> Do I have to make a move if it puts my stone in jeopardy, or can I forfeit my turn? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> No, you must move a checker if there is an open spot. The only time you forfeit is when all spots that correspond to the number you rolled have two or more checkers from the opposing player on them. </p>

<p> Tips </p>
<p> If you rolled the same number on both dice (like 4-4), that's a double. If you rolled a double, instead of moving twice the number you got, you move four times the number you got. For example, if you rolled 3-3, you move 3 steps four times. </p>
<p> If the dice (or even only one die) fall off the board or lands on a checker, you must roll them both again. </p>

<p> Backgammon is a 2-player board game that is played on a backgammon board, which is a board divided in the middle with 12 triangular spaces, called points, in each quadrant. Each player sits on opposite sides of the board and has 15 color-coded checker pieces to play with. The goal of the game is to be the first to remove all of your pieces off of the board, which is also called “bearing off.” To set the game up, the first player sets 3 pieces up in a vertical row at the base of the fifth point from their left, in the bottom half of the board, and 5 pieces in the first point directly to the bottom right of the board’s partition. Then, that player lines up 5 pieces at the left-most point at the top left, and 2 pieces in the last point on the top right. The opposing player sets their color’s pieces up to mirror their opponent’s pieces, so that each row of 2 has a mirror row of 2 on the opposite side, each row of 3 has a mirror row of 3, and so on. The first player’s pieces are only allowed to move counterclockwise, starting in the top right. The second player’s pieces are only allowed to move clockwise, starting at the top on their left. To start play, players take alternating turns rolling 2 6-sided dice. For each of the numbers that gets rolled, the rolling player moves 1 or 2 pieces based on the numbers rolled on the dice. So a roll of a 5 and 2 would allow the rolling player to move one piece 2 points and another piece 5 points. Alternatively, that player may move 1 piece 7 points. Rolling 2 of the same number allows that player to move 4 times. For example, a roll of 2 and 2 allows that player to move a total of 8 points, although each piece being moved must travel 2 points at a time. Players cannot move a piece to a point that is occupied by 2 or more of their opponent’s pieces, but may stack their own pieces on a single point. If a player moves a piece to a point with only 1 of their opponent’s pieces on it, that opposing player’s piece is removed from the board and placed on the middle partition. At the beginning of the next player’s turn, they must use at least 1 of their rolls to remove that piece from the partition and start it over from the beginning point on their side of the board. Once all of a player’s pieces are in the quadrant of the board closest to the end, that player may begin removing pieces off of the board. Once a player moves a piece 1 point past the edge of the board, it is removed from the game. A player wins once all of their pieces are removed from the board. If you want to learn how to get your pieces off of the board so you can win, keep reading the article! </p>

<p> Play-by-post role-playing game </p>
<p> This article is about games played in forum posts. For games played by mail, see Play-by-mail game. </p>
<p> A play-by-post role-playing game (or sim) is an online text-based role-playing game in which players interact with each other and a predefined environment via text. It is a subset of the online role-playing community which caters to both gamers and creative writers. Play-by-post games may be based on other role-playing games, non-game fiction including books, television and movies, or original settings. This activity is closely related to both interactive fiction and collaborative writing. Compared to other roleplaying game formats, this type tends to have the loosest rulesets. </p>
<p> Play-by-post roleplaying has its origins on the large computer networks and bulletin board systems of major universities in the United States in the 1980s. It drew heavily upon the traditions of fanzines and off-line role-playing games.[citation needed] The introduction of IRC enabled users to engage in real-time chat-based role-playing and resulted in the establishment of open communities.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Development of forum hosting software and browser-based chat services such as AOL and Yahoo Chat increased the availability of these mediums to the public and improved accessibility to the general public. </p>
<p> Unlike other forms of online role-playing games such as MUDs or MMORPGs, the events in play-by-post games are rarely handled by software and instead rely on participants or moderators to make decisions or improvise. Players create their own characters and descriptions of events and their surroundings during play.[1] Results of combat, which may include Player versus player encounters, may be determined by chance through dice rolls or software designed to provide a random result. The results of random chance may need to be provided to the players in order to avoid disputes that may be a result of cheating or favoritism. Alternatively a forum may be diceless and rely on cooperation among players to agree on outcomes of events and thus forgo the use of randomisers. </p>
<p> In the latter case, combat and other measures are handled by requiring players to avoid detailing the results of their actions, and thus leave an opening for a response by other involved players. Consider the following possible post from a character named Bob attacking Joe: </p>
<p> Bob punched Joe in the chest, knocking him over. </p>
<p> This post makes the assumption that Joe takes no further action to avoid the attack from Bob and that he will drop as a result. These types of actions are often called "autohits" as they "automatically hit" without allowing for a response by the affected character, and there may be rules against such actions (commonly referred to as the 'no power playing' rule). Alternatively, Bob may be required to write something like the following: </p>
<p> Bob swung a punch at Joe's chest, attempting to knock him over. </p>
<p> This allows Joe to respond to the action without contradicting the post. </p>
<p> Depending on the rules established on the forum, role-playing and story can be pushed forward through moderation by a gamemaster, specific rules (often existing role-playing game systems), or by mutual agreement between players. </p>
<p> Some games allow members of any writing proficiency to join, while others may require members to provide a sample of writing for review before allowing participation. In addition, a minimum word-count for each post may be required in order to encourage more detailed writing. Forums that cater to all levels of role-playing may have specific sections for various difficulty levels. </p>
<p> In general, each player plays and develops his or her own character. Characters may be original creations of the player, or may be based on a character taken from canon if the setting and rules provide this option. Each community may have its own rules regarding the process of character creation and either allow characters to be liberally created and used with minimal review, or require characters to undergo a review process in which administrators examine the character application and decide whether to approve or reject the application. </p>
<p> In many cases, characters are regarded as belonging to the players who created them, and others are not allowed to make drastic changes to them without the creator's prior consent (referred to as god-modding). </p>
<p> In addition to standard characters, games may also incorporate non-player characters (NPCs). Some NPCs have recurring roles, while others appear only briefly to aid in the writing of a scene. The use and control of NPCs varies widely among role-playing games. </p>
<p> Games vary in the degree to which the setting is established; some go as far as to include a virtual "world" to roleplay in, while others allow players to improvise the setting as they progress. Settings may be derived from novels, TV shows or movies (often resulting in collaborative fan-fiction) or may be original and unique to the game. </p>
<p> Play-by-post games are frequently written in the third person perspective due to the fact that multiple players must share each scene, each with his or her character as the focus of attention. Common online game terms such as OOC (Out of character) or OOG (Out of Game) are used to differentiate in-character from personal posting. </p>
<p> The opening message or post of each scene typically lays down the scenario and describes a scene, or continues from a previously started scene. Threads then become an ongoing story in which players periodically advance the plot by reading the latest reply and then responding with what their character does and how the environment changes in response. These replies are often open-ended so that other players can continue. </p>
<p> Internet forums (aka Play-By-Message-Board or PBMB, Forum Role-Playing or simply Forum-Games) are the most common medium for Play-by-Post gaming.[citation needed] Forums may provide features such as online dice rolling, maps, character profiling and game history. Using a forum (as opposed to a live-chat interface) allows players to re-read what they have previously written at a later date, and to read posts made by players in other threads. Many online services provide free game hosting specifically for gamemasters, or provide general forum services that can be used for role-playing purposes (such as Proboards or Invisionfree). </p>
<p> As an asynchronous collaborative editing tool, forums lack safeguards to prevent two writers from posting simultaneously and contradicting each other. House Rules may require players to take turns sequentially in order to avoid such conflicts, or players may require posts to be edited or deleted to rectify the situation which may result in dispute and intervention from a moderator if one is available. To avoid this, many boards offer guides and tips on roleplay etiquette. </p>
<p> Many message boards are listed in roleplay directories, such as TopRPsites to make them easy to find. </p>
<p> Twitter and Tumblr are also very popular mediums for Roleplaying. </p>
<p> Play-by-post role-playing is generally devoted to advancing a single overarching storyline that all board members participate in, rather than many different non-related stories proceeding in separate threads [the latter being known as "multi-genre"]. They vary in organization, but the primary formation includes a full set of rules governing role-playing, out-of-character conduct, combat between players, threads detailing a set storyline (often contributed to by plot-advancing, staff-organized events, or player role-plays), character approval forums, and a full staff with admin(s) and moderators. Larger boards set in a single setting are often organized by cutting up the setting into separate forums, each based on locations within the setting. </p>
<p> Many message board based games, such as NationStates, establish a hierarchy of moderators to manage plot, pacing and continuity. To keep story threads organized the message board is often organized into forums based on geographical location within the game setting. Other message boards, however, may choose to sort their board on genre. </p>
<p> Play-by-email (PBeM) games are played as other play-by-mail games, using email as the postal medium. Players email their actions to the gamemaster or to each other using a mailing list. Play-by-email games are often slow, since the players must wait for each post before replying, but have the advantage that replies may be tailored to the players, allowing the gamemaster to keep information secret from the other players. </p>
<p> This should not be confused with simming style of post or email games. Sims are more collaborative storytelling, where each player tells a portion of the story, usually utilizing other characters in the area as they wish in order to complete their portion of the story. PBeM games more closely resemble table-top role playing games where players react to gamemaster presented scenarios, and characters actions are controlled by individuals. </p>
<p> Online Chat Rooms may be used in a similar fashion as forums for role-playing purposes. Unlike forums, posts are displayed to the screen in real-time and thus may increase the pace at which responses are written. Play-by chat games require users to be present for the duration of a scene which may last several hours. The game may be supplemented by external character profiles or may rely on users to provide information about their character upon request or upon entering a room. </p>
<p> Real-time interaction between characters in chat rooms are similar to those encountered in MUDs but lack automated features of MUDs such as combat resolution and item descriptions. Players in chat rooms are required to describe objects and events through manually written text. </p>
<p> Play-by-internet (PBI) refers to fully automated games which take place using server-based software. Play-by-internet games differ from other play-by-post games in that, for most computerized multiplayer games, the players have to be online at the same time, and players can make their moves independently of any other players in the game. The turn-time is usually fixed. A server updates the game after the turn-time has elapsed evaluating all the player's moves sent to the server. The turn-time duration can be hours, days, weeks or even months. </p>
<p> A play-by-wiki game is played using wiki software instead of a forum. Because players' previous posts are editable and the gamemaster takes responsibility as the overall editor of the story, plot holes can be avoided and writing skills may not be as important for each writer. </p>
<p> Wiki space provides not only a means of communication, but also a permanent archive and a designated off-topic discussion area for each page. Players can edit posts freely because records are automatically maintained and changes can be easily undone. Sites such as Wetpaint are commonly used for this. </p>
<p> The role-playing blog (RPB) is a game which is played out online using posts within a blog or weblog. Unlike message board role-playing, a role-playing blog is generally restricted to one gaming group, and the blog contains static files such as maps, archives, and character sheets specific for that group. RPBs often incorporate mixed elements of message board role-playing, play-by-chat, as well as play-by-email styles, allowing players to mix and match the style of play that they prefer. Popular blog sites used to host these games are Tumblr and LiveJournal.[2] </p>
<p> The style of role-playing on Tumblr often comes in the format of a 'main blog', the headquarters of the game, and multiple character blogs from which each player posts. The main blog often advertises for players through the tags of Tumblr. The main blog is where applicants to the game apply by filling out an application on the main blog, and where other such administration of the game occurs. The Roleplay game creator is often referred to as the "Admin" short for "Administrator" and players may be required to run major plots and game changes by the Admin before proceeding, making the Admin function in a way that a traditional GM might have. Players role-play by reblogging each other's posts and adding paragraphs of interaction from their own character to the end, each of which are called 'paras.' Often seen are text posts with dialogue and an accompanying .gif image expressing the character mood or intended expression of emotion. Though, recently .jpg icons have risen in popularity in some games. </p>
<p> The style of role-playing on Livejournal style RPB's is maintained through "community" blogs that connect "character blogs or journals." Character Blogs/Journals are generally written in first-person character driven context. These character journals are then open to all players of the community to interact on a first person style of writing. Interaction on the "Community" blog is done mostly in third person storybook fashion. RPB's on a "livejournal platform" are frequently run by an individual referred to as MOD (moderator). MOD's are in charge of creating the community/game setting, character limitations, rules, style of play, frequency of play and general worldly game views. MOD's are also in charge of creating worldly events for game play response for individually plotted characters. </p>
<p> Somewhat similar to blogs and wikis, Google's documents can have permissions set to allow users to access and modify a document online. This allows multiple users to edit the document at the same time, meaning that others can modify the story online. There is also a revision history that can be split allows commenting on particular words or phrases, or even a general comment, as well as a chat bar for that particular document. Since this form of role-playing is relatively new, it's not a common way of role-playing, and it has drawbacks in the content being editable by anyone with permissions. </p>
<p> In diceless games where randomisers are not used to determine the outcome of combat, the onus is on players to come to an agreement[citation needed]. Disputes may arise from players in competitive engagements if neither player is able to come to a compromise that is acceptable to both. Players may write their characters in a way that makes them overly powerful or invulnerable, a practice referred to as "power-gaming", "god-modding", or "superhero syndrome"[citation needed]. In such cases, a moderator may be required to review the conflict and make a ruling as to what should be accepted as the final result. In some rulesets, the winner of a contest may be a foregone conclusion agreed upon out-of-character and the battle itself a ceremonial description of each character's prowess. In other systems, the only rule may be that the first character to yield or surrender is the loser of the combat. No matter the case, some sort of player consent to wins and losses is required in this type of role-playing game. </p>
<p> For this reason, text-based role-playing games tend to be focused slightly more on story and player-character interactions, negotiations, and relationships rather than combat. Combat-focused games tend to flow more smoothly in more rules based role-playing platforms and venues such as MUDs, D&D-style games, or video games, where character building or playing skill rather than consent determines the winner of a combat, and play-by-post games usually focus on exploration, negotiation, or romance storylines where characters aren't usually directly opposing one another. </p>

<p> Cribbage is a challenging game that can be played with 2-6 people (not 5). Although it may seem intimidating at first, the basic game is very easy to learn and play. If you have a cribbage board (or pen and paper) and a deck of cards, you're ready! </p>
<p> Steps </p>
<p> Part 1 of 4: </p>
<p> Setting Up and Forming Hands </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Get a cribbage board (including pegs) and a standard deck of 52 cards. For this game, the jokers are not used. Each player will need two pegs for scoring -- these can be found underneath the board. The set may include additional pegs for keeping track of match scores. If a proper board is unavailable, the players can keep score with pencil and paper. </p>
<p> The two pegs for each player are used to indicate the score in the previous turn and the score of the current turn. This way, any math can be easily checked and double-checked. </p>
<p> The first to accumulate 121 points wins. This often occurs in the middle of a deal; the game then ends immediately. Two trips around the board (with your pegs) is equivalent to this. If you are playing a short game, one trip signifies the end, with a player winning at 61. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Pick a dealer and deal the hand. To determine who deals first, any player picks up the deck and shuffles it 2 or 3 times. The deck is placed face down on the table; each player pulls out one card. The person with the lowest card is the dealer. The dealer deals 6 cards to each player. </p>
<p> Being the dealer has its upsides and downsides. The dealer gets the advantage of the crib; however, the non-dealer(s) immediately gets 3 points (for compensation[1] X Research source ) and can "peg out" before the dealer even gets a chance to tally his/her score and win (because the dealer goes last). </p>
<p> If you're playing multiple rounds, rotate dealers just like you rotate turns. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Form the "crib." Each player looks at their 6 cards and decides which 4 to keep in his hand and which 2 to discard face-down into a pile near the dealer called "the crib." This is a hand that is looked at at the end of the game and is reserved for the dealer and the dealer only. </p>
<p> The crib is an enormous part of cribbage strategy. If you are the dealer, you can save away your good cards in this crib for later. If you are not the dealer, you must try to give the dealer as weak of a hand as possible, while not jeopardizing your own play. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Flip the up-card or starter card. The player who did not deal cuts the deck to determine the top card. Then, the dealer should flip it over. Both players will use this card, called the "cut," as a wild fifth card to count points at the end of the round. </p>
<p> If this "up-card" is a Jack, the dealer gets to peg 2 points immediately. This score is called "his heels" or "his nibs."[2] X Research source </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Part 2 of 4: </p>
<p> Scoring Points </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Start counting. Players alternate laying cards down in their own piles, starting with the non-dealer. As they play each card, they call out the value of the total. Face cards have a value of 10; all others are worth their numeric value. Aces are always only worth 1 point. Suits do not matter in this round; only numeric values. Play stops at 31 (or when no one can lay down a card). </p>
<p> If the first player lays a 3 and the second player lays a 4, the first player calls out, "3" and the second player calls out "7." Though they're in separate piles, it's the cumulative total of all the cards. </p>
<p> The cards are kept in these separate piles because at the end of the game, each person's hand is tallied on its own. However, all players should be able to see every card played. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Start "pegging." Make pairs, runs, and other combinations to score points. While you're laying cards and thinking about not going over 31, use what your opponent(s) is laying to your advantage. You get extra points for pairs, runs, and certain numbers. As you score, move your peg around the board. </p>
<p> If either player reaches 15 points exactly, this earns him 2 points. </p>
<p> Points are also earned and pegged for pairs (and triplets, etc.). For example, player 1 lays down a 7 and Player 2 immediately follows with another 7, which would earn him 2 points. If Player 1 then lays down a third 7, he earns 6 points. The fourth seven would be worth 12 points. (Note: if Player 2 is not able to lay down any other card without exceeding 31, and Player 1 has the fourth seven, he can lay it down and earn the 12 points.) </p>
<p> Sequences also score points. They must be consecutive cards, but not necessarily in order. For example: The first player plays a 4, second player plays a 6. If the first player now plays a 5 he would score three points for completing a run of 3. If the second player now plays a 3 or a 7 he would then score 4 points for making a run of 4. </p>
<p> After "31" (or as close as possible in the hand), the person laying down the last card takes a point for having the final card. If the last card makes exactly 31, the player gets 1 additional point. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Continue until a player cannot lay down another card without exceeding 31. At this point, he says "Go." If the other player can still lay down another card without exceeding 31, he must do so for as many times as necessary. Once he lays down as many cards as he can without going over 31, he says "Go" and earns 1 point. However, if the total he ends up with is exactly 31, he earns 2 points. </p>
<p> It is 1 point per "Go," not 1 point per card able to be laid down without exceeding 31. If you can lay 1 card without exceeding 31, you get 1 point; if you can lay 3 cards without exceeding 31, you still get 1 point. </p>
<p> This player can also get extra points for runs and the like during this time. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Part 3 of 4: </p>
<p> Finishing the Round </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Count up the cards to get your final score. Once all cards have been played, it is time to count them up. The person to count first is the non-dealer(s), then the dealer, then the crib. Your hand consists of the four cards you played, plus the cut card. This is why you kept them in separate piles! If you are the dealer, count your original hand and the crib separately. </p>
<p> You score one point if you hold the Jack of the suit that was cut. </p>
<p> Pairs, triples and quadruples count -- 2, 6 and 12 points, respectively. </p>
<p> Sequences (e.g. 6-7-8) do not have to be the same suit, and count as 1 point per card. They must consist of at least three cards. </p>
<p> Any combination of cards that add up to 15 counts as 2 points (even if it took all five cards to do it). You may use a card more than once in different combinations. </p>
<p> A flush (all four cards are the same suit) is worth 4 points. </p>
<p> The cut cannot give you a flush. It gives a fifth point if it extends a 4 card flush to a 5 card flush, but 3 spades and a heart don't score flush points if you cut a spade. (When counting the crib, only 5 card flushes score.) </p>
<p> If all four cards in the crib are the same suit, no points can be taken unless the fifth card is also that same suit. Then 5 points are pegged. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Consider the "Muggins" variation. Because patterns and scoring are so intricate in this game, lots of players like to take advantage of the possibility of their opponent flubbing up and missing would-be points in their hand. This is called the "Muggins" rule. </p>
<p> Each player tallies up their hand aloud. If they finish and another player notices points they missed, they call out, "Muggins!" and receive those up-for-grab points. If playing this variation, it's important to be thorough! </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Play until one person reaches 121. If no player has made two trips around the board (or one trip for a short game), play another round. The next person then deals and the game continues as normal. When someone does reach 121, the game immediately stops. That person is the winner, even if other players have yet to take their turn. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Part 4 of 4: </p>
<p> Playing with Strategy </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Don't start off with a 5. Odds are the next player has a card in their hand worth 10. If you start off with a 5, they'll probably be able to land on 15, scoring them 2 points. Ideally start off with a 4 -- it has the least amount of value to you. </p>
<p> Aces or deuces should be kept to make a 31 or to upset your opponent's "Go."[3] X Research source Generally lower cards are useless, but not in this case. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Think about what you put into the crib. If you are not the dealer, it's best to avoid putting 5s into the crib (if there are any tens in there at all, that's an automatic 15). Obviously, avoid putting in pairs and numbers that are consecutive (6 and 7, for example, to avoid sequences). Ace and King are pretty safe to put in, as they are too low and too high to be any real threat. </p>
<p> If you are the dealer, it's a magic touch between "salting" your crib with good cards but still keeping a decent hand for play.[3] X Research source Try to envision what you think the other players will toss away and working off of that. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Avoid landing on 21. Cribbage is very much a game of thinking ahead. You are setting your opponent up for each play they make, allowing or not allowing them points. In as much as you want to avoid 15, also avoid 21. A ten or a face card and voila! 31 they've got. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> If you're close to winning, don't worry about the crib. You've played four rounds already and you're at 116 points? Great -- toss whatever you'd like into the crib, just keep the best hand possible. Odds are you won't make it to the end of the game, so don't worry about crib strategy. Just play your best cards and get out of there! The game ends as soon as you win, no crib counting allowed. </p>
<p> Cribbage Help </p>
<p> Community Q&A </p>
<p> Do I shuffle the cards at the end of each turn playing cribbage? </p>
<p> Brett Meyer </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Yes. The cards are shuffled by the dealer, and then the dealer offers the deck to his opponent (or the player to his left if there are more than 2 players) for the cards to be cut by that player. The dealer is allowed to re-shuffle the cards after they have been cut, but if he does so, the cards must be cut again (see above) prior to him dealing them out. Only one re-shuffle is allowed by the dealer per turn. </p>
<p> Does a player have to play his highest card or can he play a lower card to try for more points? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> You can use any of your cards at any time that you haven't used as long as you don't go over 31. </p>
<p> How many points would I get for three tens played? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> The first 10 played earns 0 points, the second 10 played earns 2 points as a pair, and the third 10 played earns 6 points. </p>
<p> What direction do the cards get dealt. Going towards the left or the right player? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Always left. The pegging also starts from the left, so does counting points at the end. </p>
<p> How many points would I have with 2 aces,1 two and 2 threes? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> 16. The run of A,2,3 would count four times, because A(1),2,3(1) is a run, as are A(1),2,3(2), A(2),2,3(1), and A(2),2,3(2), each for 3 points, and then the A,A pair and 3,3 pair each count for 2. </p>
<p> If player one lays down a 10, and player two then plays a J followed by Q after 30, can the next player score by laying down a Q? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> No, because the count starts over after 31. If he or she has an ace, he can play it - but if not, it is a go situation where you can play an ace. If you do not have an ace, you get a point for the go, and the count starts over again. </p>
<p> You would play with three teams of two, dealing five cards to each team, and dealing a random card to the crib. So each team and the crib ends up with four cards. </p>
<p> 12 points. Every combination of two sevens and an ace totals 15 for two points. Since you can get three unique pairs of sevens out of three sevens (7#1 & 7#2, 7#1 & 7#3, and 7#2 & 7#3) and combine each of those pairs of sevens with the ace to total 15, that alone gets you six points (two points for each of the three fifteens that you made). Add to those six points the six points for having three sevens (known as a "pair royal" or triplet) to arrive at a total of 12 points. But that only covers four cards -- don't forget that you also get to use the cut-card (or "up card" or "starter card") as the fifth card of your hand. </p>
<p> What would the score be with (4) sevens and (1) one? </p>
<p> Brett Meyer </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> The score would be 24 points! 4 sevens contain 6 unique pairs of sevens (such as 7#1 + 7#2, 7#1 +7#3, etc.). Combining each of these six pairs of sevens with the ace equals six fifteens, which are worth 2 points each, equaling 12 points. Add to those 12 points the 12 more points for the four sevens (known as a "double pair royal" or "quads") to get your grand total of 24 points. </p>

<p> Tips </p>
<p> Remember, the person who wins is the first person to peg OUT, which means beyond the pegs on the cribbage board, not to the last hole. </p>
<p> When counting the points on your cards, start off with fifteens, then pairs or triplets, then runs, then 4 or 5 of the same suit. </p>
<p> Try to never place a five or a pair in your opponent's crib. On the other hand, don't destroy your own good hand just to give your opponent a lousy crib. </p>
<p> A 10 card is most likely to be the up-card, so try to gear your 4 cards towards that by saving any fives. A hand that contains a 5 or two cards that sum to five can never score zero. </p>
<p> When starting a round, it is best to begin with a 4, a 3, or even a 2 - your opponent cannot reach 15 with any of those. </p>
<p> Experts suggest that throwing an off-suited K-10 to the opponent's crib will on average give up the fewest points. A pair of fives is by far the worst. </p>
<p> It is impossible to have a hand worth 19 points. So if you hear a person counting their hand say "nineteen," it's just a slang way of saying zero. </p>

<p> To play Cribbage, you'll need a Cribbage board, pegs, and a deck of cards. The goal of Cribbage is to score 121 points before your opponent by creating different card combinations. To start the game, shuffle the deck and have each player take half of it. Whoever has the lowest card on the bottom of their half deals first. Deal 6 cards to each player. Then, each player looks at their hand and chooses 2 cards to remove from the game. Place these cards off to the side face-down. These cards are called the "crib." Next, cut the deck and reveal the top card on the bottom half. This card is the starter card. The starter card is used to help calculate points at the end of play. If the starter card is a Jack, the dealer starts the game with 2 points automatically. After the starter card is revealed, the non-dealing player reveals a card from their hand. Then, the dealer reveals a card on their side of the table. Each card’s numeric value is added to the previous card’s numeric value to track the score up to a total of 31, with kings, queens, and jacks counting for 10, and aces counting as 1. Each player announces the running total as they play their card. For example, the non-dealing player may put a 6 down and say, “6.” The dealer then may play an 8 and say, “14.” The running total can never exceed 31. If a player cannot play a card from their hand without exceeding 31, they say, “Go,” and the other player scores 1 point. The scoring player may then play another card without exceeding 31. If a player reaches exactly 31, they get 2 points. After reaching 31 or “Go,” the running total resets to 0 and the player that failed to score plays their next card. Keep track of the score by moving your peg into the corresponding slot on the board. Move it every time you score and add your points together. You can also score points by creating combinations of cards while playing your hand out, which is called “pegging.” These points are calculated at the end of the round after all of the cards have been played. When both players have played all of the cards in their hands, the cards are counted for points in the following order: non-dealer’s hand, dealer’s hand, then the crib. The starter card is assumed to be a part of both player’s hands while they’re scoring points. If you have any 2 cards that add up to 15, you score 2 points. If you played 2 cards of the same rank, you get 2 points. You get 6 points for playing 3 of the same card in a row, and 12 points for playing 4 of the same cards in a row. You also score 1 point for every card played in an ascending or descending order. For example, if the dealing player plays a 3, followed by another 3 and a 4, they’ve earned 3 points. The dealer counts their hand first, followed by the non-dealing player. Then, the crib is counted by the dealing player. Any combinations in the crib are scored for the dealer. Scoring for the crib is counted the same way as regular play, with one adjustment. If the face-up card on top of the deck shares a suit with a jack in the crib, the dealing player is awarded an additional point. When you're finished scoring a round, the non-dealing player from the previous round shuffles the cards and deals out a new hand. Keep playing until one player reaches 121 points and wins! For more tips, including how to score each hand and end the round, read on! </p>

<p> Cricket is one of the most popular games in the world, with billions of fans in the Subcontinent, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and many other countries. Whether you've always wanted to play yourself, or just live somewhere (such as America) where cricket is less common, if you are curious to learn more about it, read the steps below to learn the basics of playing cricket. </p>
<p> Steps </p>
<p> Part 1 of 3: </p>
<p> Setting up </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Acquire equipment. Cricket requires a few pieces of specialized equipment to play with safety. At the bare minimum, 6 stumps, 4 bails, 2 cricket bats and 1 ball are required. These days, all teams have uniforms, but in the olden days, all uniforms were white. However, white uniforms are sometimes used in test matches these days. </p>
<p> Stumps and bails are wooden pieces that are assembled to create the wicket, one of the most important objects in cricket. Setting up wickets is described in greater detail at the end of this section. </p>
<p> The cricket bat is a large bat made of willow wood that is flat on one side and bulged on the other, for strength. The ball should be hit with the flat part of the bat for the best distance on a hit. If the ball is hit with the bulged side of the bat, then the runs will not be counted. </p>
<p> The cricket ball is similar to a baseball in size and composition, but is sewn in a straight line rather than a tennis ball pattern, creating 2 equal hemispheres separated by stitching. Cricket balls are traditionally red with white stitching; in modern times, white balls are sometimes used for better visibility during “limited over” games (which generally go into the night), where coloured uniforms are worn rather than the traditional white. </p>
<p> Cricket uniforms consist of long pants, a shirt (which may be long- or short-sleeved), and shoes. Most cricket players wear cleats (spike-tread shoes) for better grip on the field, but it isn't required. In games with a traditional red ball, outfits must always be white or off-white. Team colours may be used for games with white balls. </p>
<p> The wicket-keeper (a ball catcher) is allowed to wear safety equipment similar to that of a baseball catcher's: webbed mitts, shin guards, and a helmet. No other player is allowed to wear protective equipment in the field unless they are close to the batsmen in which case they get to wear a helmet and shin guards. </p>
<p> Learn about the cricket field. Cricket is played on a large, oval-shaped field. The field has a rectangular strip in the center, which is called the pitch. A boundary line should be clearly marked all around the outside edge of the field. </p>
<p> The pitch is where the bowler (pitcher) bowls the ball to the other team's striker (batter). Regulation play has the pitch at 22 yards (20.1 m) long by 10 feet (3.0 m) wide. </p>
<p> A cricket field doesn't strictly have to be oval according to the rules, but it usually is. </p>
<p> Mark creases. Areas of the pitch are divided into segments by lines called “creases.” There are 4 creases:[1] X Research source </p>
<p> The popping crease, which is also sometimes called the batting crease, marks the boundary beyond which the batter is no longer safe from being run out (taken out of play by the fielding, or defending, team). </p>
<p> The 2 return creases run parallel to the long edges of the pitch, one on each side, back from the popping crease to the end of the pitch. </p>
<p> The bowling crease runs parallel to the popping crease between the 2 return creases, dividing the area behind the popping crease into 2 rectangular sections. The bowler must stand at or behind the bowling crease before they bowl. </p>
<p> Each end of the pitch is marked off with creases, leaving a rectangle of open space between them on the center of the pitch. Aside from the boundary marker, the rest of the cricket field is not marked. </p>
<p> Set up wickets. A wicket is a structure made from 3 stakes, called stumps, driven into the ground, with 2 cross pieces called bails set on grooves between each pair of them (left-center and center-right). In most cases, a batsman whose wicket loses a bail from being struck with the ball, is out, so defending the wickets is an important part of offensive play. </p>
<p> Wickets should be set 28.5 inches (72.4 cm) high, with a total width of 9 inches (22.9 cm) across the three stumps. </p>
<p> Wickets are placed so that the center stump of each wicket is in the center of the bowling crease, with the other two stumps equidistant on either side of it along the crease. One wicket is set up on each bowling crease, for a total of two on the pitch. Batsmen (batters) stand in front of their wickets during play. </p>
<p> Recognize the goal of the game. As in most field games, the goal of cricket is to score points, called runs, against the opposing team by running from one point to another before the play can be ended or you're run out by the defenders, who are called the “fielding team.” The team at bat is called the “batting team.”[2] X Research source </p>
<p> Learn the basics of gameplay. Each team in cricket is comprised of 11 players (though an alternate twelfth player may be held in reserve in case of injury, but is not otherwise used for anything). At any given time, the fielding team has all 11 players on the field, whereas the batting team has 2, called the batsmen. The batsmen try to hit the ball after it is bowled by the bowler for the fielding team, and then switch positions without getting an out to score runs.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> All of the positions on the pitch have official names. The person who bowls the ball is the bowler, and the batsman who is facing the bowler is called the striker. The other batsman, who stands near the bowler at the far side of the pitch from the striker, is called the non-striker. Finally, the fielding team member who stands behind the wickets at the striker's end of the field is called the wicket-keeper. Other positions in the field have colloquial names, but none are official. </p>
<p> Understand the structure. Cricket, much like baseball, uses specialized terms to describe each section of the game. Depending on the length of the game to be played, the number of innings varies between 1 and 2 per team. Each innings (the word “innings” is used both singular and plural) can contain any number of “overs,” which are sets of bowls.[4] X Research source </p>
<p> Every time the bowler bowls the ball, whether or not it is hit by the striker, a tally is counted. Once a bowler has bowled the ball 6 times in one direction, an “over” is declared. At the over, the bowler must be replaced with a new bowler. Bowlers can't bowl consecutive overs, but they can rotate back in after at least 1 bowl from another bowler, so theoretically 2 bowlers could trade off bowling for the entire innings. When there's an over, the position of the bowler changes from one end of the pitch to the other. </p>
<p> This also means that the striker can change between overs, depending on which end of the pitch they are on when the over is called. Strikers also change depending on how many runs are completed, since the bowler doesn't change position except at an over. For example, if only 1 run is completed, the striker and non-striker have switched ends of the pitch, making the non-striker the striker for the next bowl. </p>
<p> Any time a batsman is declared out,they must leave the field and be replaced by a teammate. If the fielding team manages to score 10 outs in an innings, the innings is over, as there are no more batsmen to fill in the second spot on the pitch. </p>
<p> An innings is a single period of gameplay for the entire batting team. In short forms of cricket, a set number of overs are allowed to each team per innings; once that number is reached, the innings ends even if the fielding team hasn't made 10 outs. In the most prestigious and professional form of cricket, called Test cricket, any number of overs per innings is allowed, meaning that the innings normally only ends once 10 outs are reached. Once an innings ends, the fielding team and batting team switch roles, and the innings for the fielding (now batting) team begins. </p>
<p> Test cricket games last a maximum of 5 days, and are played 6 hours a day during that time. The shortest commonly played form of cricket, Twenty20, allows 1 innings per team, with a maximum of 20 overs per innings, and typically takes no more than a few hours to complete. </p>
<p> Recognize the importance of the wickets. Wickets are a central part of cricket. One of the chief ways to out a batsman is to knock 1 or both of the bails off of his wicket with the ball, which is called “breaking” the wicket. There are several conditions under which this will result in an out: </p>
<p> If the bowler manages to directly hit the striker's wicket on a bowl and break it, the striker is considered out “bowled.” </p>
<p> If a batsman is outside either popping crease on the pitch, the bowler may break their wicket, either by hitting it with the ball in their hand, or by hitting it with the ball directly. In this case, the batsman is said to have been “run out.” </p>
<p> Since non-strikers often leave the popping crease as the bowler is about to bowl (in much the same way that baseball players edge away from bases in anticipation of a run to the next base), the bowler can out the non-striker by stopping the bowl and breaking the wicket before he returns to the crease. This is also considered a run out. </p>
<p> If the striker misses the ball while attempting to hit it, and steps outside the popping crease, the wicket-keeper can break his wicket by catching the bowl cleanly and striking the wicket with the ball, resulting in an out. This type of out is called being “stumped.” </p>
<p> If the striker intentionally uses any part of their body to block the ball from hitting the wicket, they are out “leg before wicket.” This is usually abbreviated LBW. </p>
<p> If the striker hits their own wicket by accident and breaks it, they are out “hit wicket.” Hit wicket outs happen no matter what struck the wicket, but only happen if the striker was attempting to hit the ball, or has hit the ball and is attempting to run to the other end of the pitch. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the striker has hit the ball and it directly flies into the non-striker's wicket, the non-striker isn't out. The bowler can still pick up the ball and redirect it at the non-striker's wicket to run him out. </p>
<p> Learn the other ways to out a batsman. In addition to the wicket, there are several other ways to out a batsman. Some of them are very common, while others happen rarely, if ever, at higher levels of play. Some of the more technical outs can only be decided by umpires, of which there are always 2 (and sometimes 3) on the field at any given time.[5] X Research source </p>
<p> A striker is “caught out” if a member of the fielding team catches it before it hits the ground. This is a very common type of out. If the fielder who catches the ball steps over the boundary line at the edge of the field, though, the batsman scores 6 runs instead. This includes catching the ball out of bounds, and stepping over the line after the catch. </p>
<p> If a batsman touches the ball with any hand not already holding the bat, they are taken out for “handling the ball,” unless the fielding team has given them permission first. This rule does not apply to getting hit by a bowled ball, or any other kind of accidental touching. </p>
<p> When a batsman tries to use their bat or body to swat away a ball already in play (usually in defense of their wicket), or interferes with the efforts of the fielding team to get the ball back to the pitch and get an out, they are taken out for “obstructing the field.” However, running so that the batsman's body is between the fielder holding the ball and the batsman's wicket is legal. </p>
<p> If the striker hits the ball twice on a bowl for any reason except to scoot it away from their wicket, they will be called out. Hitting the ball twice to confound fielders or attempt a better score is strictly forbidden. </p>
<p> When 1 batsman is called out, if the next batsman doesn't arrive on the field to take their place within 2 minutes, they are considered “timed out.” </p>
<p> Understand extra runs. There are a few conditions under which extra runs can be awarded. These are noted as such for purposes of calculating player averages, but are otherwise identical to any other type of run for the purpose of determining a winner. The 4 types of extra are as follows:[6] X Research source </p>
<p> On a call of “no ball” after an illegal bowl, batsmen can only be out by run out, handling the ball, obstructing the field, or hitting the ball twice. Runs scored on a call of “no ball” are considered extra, and every “no ball” a bowler throws must be compensated with another bowl in the same over. Thus, a bowler who bowled “no ball” once would have to bowl a total of 7 times instead of the usual 6 to reach the over. If no runs are scored on a “no ball,” 1 run is added to the batting team's score anyway. </p>
<p> When a bowler bowls wide, the batting team automatically scores 1 run. As with “no ball” extras, “wide” extras must be made up by the bowler by adding bowls onto their over. </p>
<p> If the striker tries to hit the ball but misses, and the wicket-keeper doesn't manage to catch it, the batsmen can try to score runs on the play. These runs are called “byes.” </p>
<p> A “leg bye” occurs when the striker tries to hit the ball with their bat, but hits it with their body instead. “Leg byes” otherwise function identically to “byes.” “Leg byes” can't be taken if the striker wasn't trying to hit the ball. </p>
<p> Set up the pitch. One batsman stands at each end of the pitch, behind the popping crease but ahead of the bowling crease. The bowler also stands at one end of the crease, starting behind the bowling crease, and bowls to the other end. The batsman to whom the bowler bowls is the striker; the batsman at the same end as the bowler is the non-striker. </p>
<p> The wicket-keeper crouches behind the striker's wicket and the bowling crease. Their job is to catch the ball should the striker miss or decline to hit the bowl. When the wicket-keeper successfully catches a ball, the striker is normally declared out. </p>
<p> The other 9 members of the fielding team can stand in any configuration at any time, as long as they stay outside the pitch. </p>
<p> Bowl the ball. The bowler starts behind the bowling crease, and bowls the ball before reaching the popping crease by moving forward and throwing the ball. A cricket bowl is always performed over-the-shoulder, with a completely straight arm. The ball is allowed to bounce on the pitch once before reaching the striker, though it doesn't have to. </p>
<p> If the bowler steps past the popping crease during the bowl, the play is called as “no ball” by the umpires. The batsmen can run as though they hit the ball, but can't be out except by a few specific methods. </p>
<p> Different bowlers have different movement styles, and may rush forward for a fast bowl, or step forward a couple of times and twist for a trickier bowl. The fastest bowls can fly at up to 90 mph (140 km/h), which given the short length of the pitch, requires a very fast response from the striker. </p>
<p> The bowl must reach the striker at or below the waist. If it's higher, or it sails out past the sides of the pitch, it is called a “wide” ball, or a “no ball,” especially in cases where the ball isn't far from the striker but is too high to hit. </p>
<p> Hit the ball and run. Using the flat side of the cricket bat, the striker can attempt to hit the ball. There are many different types of strike, each with a different advantage over the others. Once the striker has hit the ball, they and the non-striker can choose to run from end to end of the pitch, exchanging places. If both batsmen manage to run safely to the far side of the pitch, 1 run is declared, and 1 point is scored. If either batsman is declared out while trying to reach the far side of the pitch, no point is scored. </p>
<p> Batsmen don't have to run when they hit the ball. As long as they stay behind their popping lines, they're safe from most outs, so sometimes it's prudent not to run. </p>
<p> Batsmen who successfully score a run can turn around immediately and try to score another run, as many times as they think they can get away with it before the fielding team can run one of them out. Taking more than 4 runs on a bowl is very rare, but possible. </p>
<p> If a batsman hits the ball out of bounds and the ball bounced at least once on its way out, 4 runs are awarded automatically. If the ball didn't bounce before it landed out of bounds, 6 runs are awarded instead. </p>
<p> Finish the game. Play according to whatever type of game you've chosen until the appropriate number of innings has been reached. The team with the highest number of runs is the winner.[7] X Research source </p>

<p> If the ball hits the body facing the wicket, is it out? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Not always, but if the ball hits the legs before the wicket, it is out, hence called LBW. </p>
<p> While switching places, how does the batsman get out? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> The batsman gets out if a fielder hits the wickets with the ball before the batsman gets to the other wickets. </p>
<p> With spinners, many of the facing batsmen with try to smash it for six, usually over the spinner's head. Try placing a fielder at deep mid-on or deep mid-off. When the batsman mistimes the shot, the fielder can take a nice, easy catch into the bread basket. Also, place fielders deep if the batsman smashes it elsewhere (e.g., deep square leg, fine leg, point and cover). Don't place all of your fielders near the boundary, scatter some up close near the wicky because the batsman could block some and take easy singles, and, every once an awhile the spinner bowls the perfect ball and the batter nicks the ball to the slips or silly mid-on and that gives you many wickets for your team. </p>

<p> Tips </p>
<p> As a matter of course, cricket is always played during the summer, outdoors, and typically only between the hours of 1:00 PM and 6:00 PM. As a result, it can get very hot during the course of a game. Be sure to wear sunscreen and a hat, and drink plenty of water. </p>
<p> Between plays, up to 2 minutes is allowed to the players to reset for the next play. This is a good time for the batsmen to confer with each other on strategy. If you're playing as a batsman, be sure to resume your position before the two minutes are up. </p>
<p> When batting, keep your elbow high when planning a shot. When catching keep your fingers together. </p>

<p> To play cricket, first gather 2 teams of 11 players. You will also need a ball, a cricket bat, and two wickets. Wickets are made of three sticks driven into the ground called “stumps,” topped by two horizontal sticks called “bails.” The goal of the game is to score more points, or runs, than the other team. Toss a coin to decide which team will bat in the first inning. The first batting team sends 2 batsmen onto the field, one in front of each wicket, while all members of the bowling team spread out. The bowling team throws, or bowls the ball at a batsman. The batting team tries to score as many points, called runs, as they can before the inning is over. To score a run, both batsmen must run past each other to the opposite wicket while a ball is in play. The inning ends when the bowling team finishes their limited number of bowls or gets 10 of the 11 batsmen out. To get a batsman out, the bowling team can catch the ball before it hits the ground. If the bails behind the batsman are dislodged, the batsman is also out. This can be done by the batsman missing a bowled ball that hits the wicket. It can also happen if the batsman steps too far forward, misses the ball, and is unable to return to the wicket before the opposing team knocks down the bails. Lastly, the bowling side can hit the stumps with the ball before the running batsmen make it to the opposite wicket. Once a batsman is out, they leave the field and are replaced by another teammate. In the second inning, the bowling team becomes the batting team and tries to outscore the other team.

<p> You can use a guitar to play anything from death metal to classical and everything in between. Learning to play guitar is more approachable than learning to play many other instruments, once you master a few basics. You, too, can learn how to get started teaching yourself to play. </p>
<p> Identify the parts of the guitar. Whether you're playing an electric or an acoustic guitar, the instrument is essentially wood and metal. Copper-wound strings vibrate to create sound. The wooden body resonates that sound to create the warm tones we associate with a guitar.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> The strings run between the headstock of the guitar, where they are affixed to tuning pegs that can be rotated to tighten and slacken them, and the bridge, where they're fixed to the guitar's body. On an acoustic guitar, the strings are fixed to the bridge with removable pegs, and on an electric guitar the strings are generally strung through an eyelet. </p>
<p> The neck of the guitar is the long wooden piece of wood, flat on one side (this is called the fretboard) and curved on the other. The fretboard is inlaid with metal frets that demarcate the different notes. </p>
<p> An acoustic guitar will have a sound hole in the body where the sound will resonate, while an electric guitar will have as many as three magnetic pickups which will channel the sound through an amplifier. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Hold the guitar correctly. Before you start wailing like Hendrix, make sure you're holding your guitar correctly. If you're right handed, you'll play the guitar by strumming about halfway between the sound hole and the bridge with your right hand and fretting the strings on the neck with your left hand.[2] X Research source </p>
<p> To play your guitar, sit up in a straight-backed chair or stool. When you orient the guitar to your body, the smallest string should be pointed toward the ground and the thickest string should be pointed up at the ceiling. Hold the back of the guitar so it touches your stomach and chest and rests on the leg of your strumming/picking hand. </p>
<p> The guitar should be held mostly with your leg and by cradling it in your body. Your left hand is used to stabilize the neck and fret the strings. Hold the neck in the V created by your thumb and forefinger. You should be able to smoothly move your left hand up and down the neck without having to hold it up. </p>
<p> Even if you hold the guitar correctly, you may experience some discomfort while getting used to playing. Do not become discouraged if your shoulder hurts in addition to your neck, arms and hands. You will eventually get used to it. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Tune the guitar. It's no fun to play a guitar that's not in tune and can lead to some bad habits when you're first starting out. Tuning regularly will also familiarize you with which string and fret combinations correspond with which notes.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> Learn the name of each string. From the lowest to highest pitch (thickest to thinnest strings) the strings are named E, A, D, G, B, and E (after the note played when the string is plucked with no fingers touching it). Use a mnemonic to remember this order, such as "Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good Bye Eddie!" </p>
<p> Electric tuners are easy to use and very accurate. Hold it to the guitar and pluck the high E. The tuner will tell you if the guitar is "sharp" (too high) or "flat" (too low). Pick each note and tighten the string to make it go higher, or give it some slack to lower it. Make sure the room is quiet when using a tuner because the microphone on the tuner can pick up other sounds. </p>
<p> If you cannot afford a tuner, you can also tune your guitar without one by matching each note to the corresponding note on the piano. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Practice fretting the strings. The frets are the metal strips that run perpendicular to the strings that mark each note. To play a note, press your finger down between the metal strips, not on them. To say that you're playing the third fret means that you place your finger on the string in the gap between the second and third fret. If you hear buzzing, move your finger away from the lowest fret and closer to the higher fret. Hold the string down firmly so that it only vibrates between your finger and your strumming hand, with the tip of your finger doing the pressing. </p>
<p> Every time you move from one fret to another, the resulting pitch will be half a step higher as you move toward the body and a half step lower as you move toward the headstock. Practice moving up and down the fretboard, pressing the frets and getting a feel for the pressure you need to use to play a note. </p>
<p> Hold the pick. A pick, or plectrum, is a small tear-shaped piece of plastic used for picking out individual notes and strumming the guitar. They're cheap and available at any music retailer. While it's not essential to learn to play guitar with a pick, it's most generally the way to start. </p>
<p> Make a fist with your picking hand and your thumb flat on top of your curled fingers. Hold the pick by grasping it perpendicular to your fist between your thumb and index finger, with no more than a few centimeters of the smaller end sticking out of your hand.[4] X Research source </p>

<p> Part 2 of 3: </p>
<p> Playing Chords </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Learn first position chords. A chord is a harmonic group of at least three notes. For beginning guitar, there are two basic chord types: first position chords, and barre chords. First position chords can be played with a combination of open strings and pressed strings in the first three frets of the guitar. </p>
<p> When you've got the shapes down, practice switching between them as quickly as you can. Write out more or less random arrangements of the chords you want to play and switch between them, strumming once. </p>
<p> Make sure you play the appropriate notes. In A Major, for example, the low E string is not strummed. They'll be marked on the tablature with an "X". Develop good habits now for success in the long run. </p>
<p> Nicolas Adams is a 5th generation musician of Serbian Gypsy descent and the lead guitarist of the band Gypsy Tribe. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Nicolas specializes in Rumba Flamenco and Gypsy jazz and playing the guitar, Bouzouki, Balalaika, and piano. </p>
<p> Nicolas Adams Professional Guitarist </p>
<p> You can play an entire song by simply switching between minor chords. For example, try learning E-minor and A-minor first because they're easy to play. You can go from A-minor to E-minor into an F and then back to A-minor, creating a chord progression. </p>
<p> C-chord: Place your ring finger on the third fret of the fifth string. Place your middle finger on the second fret of the fourth string, and your index finger on the first fret of the second string. Strum all but the sixth string. Then, go back and play each string individually, while still playing the chord. Make sure each string rings out clearly. </p>
<p> A major: Take your index, middle, and ring finger, and place them on the second frets of the second, third and fourth strings on the guitar. It is simply one line down these three strings. Play every string but the top one. </p>
<p> G chord: Place your middle finger on the third fret of the sixth string. Place your index finger on the second fret of the fifth string, and your ring finger on the third fret of the first string. Make sure each string rings out clearly. </p>
<p> E Major: This is one of the easiest chords there is. Place your middle and ring fingers on the second frets of the fourth and fifth strings. Your index finger should go on the first fret of the third string. </p>
<p> D Major: Place your index finger on the second fret of the third string. Place your middle finger on the second fret of the first string. Place your ring finger on the third fret of the second string. Only play the bottom four strings. </p>
<p> E minor: This is exactly like E major, except you don't use your index finger. Put your middle and ring fingers on the second frets of the second and third thickest strings. </p>
<p> A minor: Place your middle and ring fingers on the second frets of the third and fourth thickest strings, and your index on the first fret of the second thinnest. This is the exact same shape as E major, just moved down one string. Again, ignore the top string. </p>
<p> D minor: Again, very similar to D Major. Place your middle finger on the second fret of the third thinnest string. Place your index finger on the first fret of the thinnest, and your ring finger on the third fret of the second thinnest. Play only the bottom four strings. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Practice getting a clean sound from every string in the chord. After you had placed all your fingers on the fretboard, play through each of the strings of the chords. Make sure that the strings that are supposed to ring are not muffled or muted. </p>
<p> If the notes are not ringing out properly, chances are that you are not pressing hard enough or parts of your fingers are touching that string which prevents it from sounding out clearly. Are any unused fingers touching strings? </p>
<p> Keep your fretting fingers curled above the fret board when they're touching the strings as if you had your fingers resting over an imaginary glass ball, or a marble in the knuckle of each finger.[6] X Research source This leaves space for the open strings to ring out unmuted. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Strum with loose, relaxed motion.[7] X Research source Strumming consists of downstrokes and upstrokes in various combinations, striking all the notes of the chord evenly and rhythmically. Use your wrist to practice smooth up and down motions. Keep your elbow in tight towards the guitar and sweep the pick down all the strings. Your elbow should not move very much, as you strum mostly from the wrist. </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Learn barre chords. Barre chords, or movable chords, are extremely useful for starting to play songs. In a barre chord (sometimes shortened to "bar chord"), the index finger of your fretting hand "bars" all the notes at a single fret. To play an F, which is the barre chord in first position, you bar all the notes on the first fret with your index finger and play what is essentially the shape of the E chord moved one step up the neck, with your middle, ring, and pinkie.[8] X Research source </p>
<p> Using the same claw-like finger positioning on the second fret, you can play an F# chord. Move to the third fret, and it becomes a G chord. It's a difficult finger positioning to learn, but you can start playing the chords to any rock or pop song relatively quickly when you learn to strum and play barre chords. The Ramones, for example, used nothing but barre chords to great effect. </p>
<p> Manage the finger pain. There'll be a point at which things will seem bleak: you can't quite get to each chord as fast as you want, your fingers are killing you, and it seems easier to put the thing back in its case. The reason most guitar players stop playing a few weeks in is that it hurts. After a couple of months and years of playing, callouses will build up on the fingers of your fretting hand that will greatly reduce the pain of pushing down the strings for long periods of time. Everyone who learns to play the guitar has to deal with sore fingers at the beginning. Learn to love the pain and associate it with everything that you love about music and the guitar. </p>
<p> Ice your fingers after playing or soak them in some apple cider vinegar to alleviate some of the pain. </p>
<p> Dipping your fingers in rubbing alcohol after playing can speed up callus build up. Just don't do it before you play.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Learn to play some songs. It's a whole lot more fun to play when you're playing a song that you can recognize and not just a set of chords or notes. Even better, 90% of music is made up of only 3-4 chords. Follow the link in the bolded text to find ten songs you can play with only four chords. </p>
<p> Start off slow and speed up gradually as you get used to the rhythm. It can be frustrating how mechanical you will sound at first, but the more comfortable you get switching between the chords, the closer you'll be to rocking out on stage. </p>
<p> As you master easier songs, move on to more complex pieces. "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynyrd Skynyrd is basically a repetition of D, C, and G in that order, but it sounds much more complex on the record because of the lead guitar licks. </p>
<p> Learn how to read guitar tabs. Guitarists have their own system of music notation called guitar tablature, or guitar tabs for short. The basic idea is to look at each line in the "staff" of the tab in the same way you look at your guitar. Each line corresponds to a string, and each number tells you which fret to hold down when plucking that string. For example, to play this tab-notated lick from the Lynyrd Skynyrd song "Sweet Home Alabama," you would play two notes on the open D string, the B string at the third fret, the G string at the second fret, etc.[10] X Research source </p>
<p> Switching between lead-style licks and chords is exciting. You'll feel like you're really making music and not just "learning guitar." Make sure you've got your chord shapes down correctly and that you're not losing the rhythm entirely when you play a quick lick. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Learn from others. The guitar is best learned by watching, listening, and mimicking the techniques of others. You don't have to take formal lessons to learn guitar, but having friends to play with and share tricks and suggestions with can be a great resource. </p>
<p> YouTube tutorials can be extremely helpful for beginners and for advanced players alike. Watching Stevie Ray Vaughn rip through a solo or seeing how Jack Johnson fingers your favorite song can be a great learning experience. </p>
<p> If you'd like to play classical or jazz guitar, or even if you'd like to learn to read sheet music, formal lessons are a good idea. Teaching yourself is a great way of developing your own style, but there is only so much you can learn without a knowledgeable mentor. </p>

<p> It's really important to start correctly. Don't just know a chord, but learn what the chord is, lwhat that chord can do, and where you go from that chord. That's the best way to start. Once you understand what the possibilities are, from each chord, from each note, from each sound, and how they blend and move together, it will be a lot easier. </p>

<p> The A minor or A major, which are literally one finger difference, and then E minor or E major, are always the best chords to start with. Then eventually, from there, you can add a D major or D minor, depending on the scale. </p>

<p> You absolutely can teach yourself to play guitar. There are many options for you to choose from to learn on your own. You can use instructional videos and books to give you lessons. You can also look up chords online that you can practice strumming to improve your ability. </p>
<p> I've read a lot of tutorials, but the problem is I don't know how to understand chords. What can I do? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> A chord consists of more than one note (of varying pitches) sounding (or intended to sound) at the same time. For help playing them, try to watch a video instead of reading about them. </p>
<p> Actually both. If you're practicing, you're going to want to sit down. Once you're comfortable sitting and practicing, then you stand and start practicing. </p>
<p> What if I'm a kid and I have trouble reaching the chords? </p>
<p> Living Concrete </p>
<p> Top Answerer </p>
<p> Just keep practicing. You'll eventually grow into the guitar and you'll be able to stretch further and further each time you try. Once you get used to it, it'll stop hurting! </p>
<p> It is so hard learning how to play guitar but I just want to play it because it is fun! I want to learn the easier way to play this guitar, how? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> There is no such thing as an easy way. All instruments require practice and effort and the guitar is no different. Try to motivate yourself instead, thinking of why you want to play guitar and visualizing yourself playing it around the campfire with others singing or in a band, etc. </p>

<p> Tips </p>
<p> If you have significant difficulty forming chord shapes with their fingers, it may be better to start off building finger strength, dexterity, and familiarity with the guitar. </p>
<p> If a chord doesn't "ring out" the way it should, play each string in the chord, you may be muting or playing a chord the wrong way. By doing this you're targeting the problem areas of the chord. Make sure you're using your finger tips to build the chord it will make you're strings sound brighter. </p>
<p> Practice fingerpicking. Look up some fingerpicking patterns online, or, for bonus points, try to figure out the patterns of some of your favorite guitar songs. </p>
<p> You probably won't be able to get the strings ringing clearly at first. Don't worry. It takes a while for your fingers to toughen up. If you practice a couple of hours a day, you'll have it mastered in what could be as short as a couple of weeks. If you practice for less time, then it will take longer. </p>
<p> Remember that it is never too early or too late to play the guitar. You might not get it right the first time, but remember to have fun and try again. </p>
<p> Plucking the strong strings may cause your fingers to hurt. To keep this from happening, use a pick. </p>
<p> Find songs that you want to play, get the tab for that song, and practice that song. It makes it more interesting to play guitar. </p>
<p> Realize that you will make mistakes; you are not alone, everyone makes mistakes sometimes. </p>
<p> If you're having a hard time fretting, try using lighter strings. They don't sound as good but they're a lot easier to use and they'll cause less pain in your fingertips. </p>
<p> Don't get frustrated if your chords don't sound good. Build up your finger strength and keep at it. It will improve. </p>
<p> Print off chord diagrams, and hang them somewhere you can always see. This will help a lot. </p>
<p> Warnings </p>
<p> Be careful not to practice too much at first. An hour a day would be enough. Don't hurt your fingers. </p>
<p> Depending on written or video tutorials without the help of lessons from an experienced teacher could lead to bad habits that are difficult to reverse. While you may learn just as effectively without formal lessons, they may be useful to correct any personal playing problems. </p>

<p> To play the guitar, first get in position. Rest the guitar on your right leg. Then, place your right hand over the strings with your elbow out to the side. Place your left thumb against the back of the fret board, and place your fingers lightly on the strings. Keep your thumb placed around the middle height of the fretboard, and try to keep your wrist relaxed. Next, learn the strings. The top string is number 6, followed by 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. They also have letter names: E, A, D, G, B, and E. You can remember this with the mnemonic, Elephants And Donkeys Grow Big Ears. Then, tune the guitar using the knobs on the guitar's neck. Now, try to learn a basic chord like a C-chord. Place the ring finger of your left hand around the third fret of the fifth string. Then, place your middle finger on the second fret of the fourth string. Finish by placing your index finger on the first fret of the second string. Strum the guitar from the fifth string down to play the C Chord, making contact with each string as you strum down. Practice strumming up and down a few times, keeping your wrist soft as you strum. </p>

Build-a-Brain Yarn Activity
Part 1. We are going to make a model of how our brains grow
through play. When the ball of yarn comes to you, share an activity
you like to do with your child(ren). Then toss the yarn across the
circle to someone on the other side until everyone has had a turn.
Part 2. Now we will show how repeating an activity thickens and
strengthens the connections in the brain. I will throw the yarn and
we’ll throw it back and forth representing a fun activity that is
repeated many times. Watch what happens to the connection.
Part 3. The connections will get weaker if they are not reinforced by
being used, but they can be built up again with more activity.

Brains are made up of billions of neurons, with trillions off connections
between them. We just showed how they are bundled together into
neural pathways.
A recent discovery is that we learn best when a lot of these brain
pathways are all operating at the same time.

How Does it Feel?
In the next few slides we will explore some ways to play about
feelings.

Mirror, Mirror - Part One
Find a partner you have not worked with before.
• Choose who will go first.
• Using your face only, act out a feeling and your partner will try to
guess which feeling it is.
• Switch.
• Do this 2 times each.

19

Playing to Learn and Learning to Play
Mirror, Mirror - Part Two
Same partners
• This time you can use your face and your body.
• Act out a feeling neither of you has acted out yet. When your
partner guesses the feeling, he or she will try to name other
feeling words that might also be used to describe the feeling

Other games to play that teach about Feelings
Feeling Freeze Tag 1: Put on music and dance with your family.
Stop the music and call out a feeling. Everyone needs to freeze in a
pose that acts out the feeling. Notice all the different poses. Take
turns calling out feelings.

Feeling Freeze Tag 2: Similar, but instead of calling out a feeling,
have the dancers act out a feeling when the music stops, and guess
which feeling each dancer is acting out.

Fun with Feelings – Singing
Do you know the song, If You’re Happy and You Know It, Clap Your
Hands? Sing it with your child and make up new verses for other
feelings. Let your child choose the actions for the new words.
For example:
•

If you’re angry and you know it, stomp your feet.

•

If you’re excited and you know it, jump up and down.

•

If you’re sad and you know it, cry a tear - Boo Hoo!

Make up new verses as your child learns new feeling words.

Social skills are key to children’s success in Kindergarten.

Young children learn social skills through play and these skills
are needed to help them succeed at all other kinds of learning.

•

Teaching, playing, and talking about feelings is very important, but it is
equally important to listen and express acceptance, understanding, and
concern for your child’s feelings.

•

The more you understand and validate their feelings, the less likely
children are to feel the need to act on them.

•

Children need to know that all feelings are OK, but not all ways of
expressing them are acceptable.

•

It is because children experience having their feelings understood and
accepted that they can begin to learn about empathy.

Examples of Validating Children’s Feelings:
“I hear that you really want me to buy that toy and that you will be
sad if I don’t buy it, but we are not going to buy a toy today. Your
birthday is coming up. You could choose to put it on your birthday
list.”
“Are you getting frustrated with that puzzle? I see that the pieces
aren’t going in very easily. What else could you try?”
“It’s OK to be mad at your sister, but it’s not OK to hit or bite her.
What else can you think of do with those mad feelings?”

Talk, talk, talk while you’re playing
Ask questions to expand the play while following your child’s lead.

Open-ended questions:
• Leave room for many possible answers and encourage the kind of
creative thinking that children will need as they grow up in this
complex and fast-changing world.
Why did you decide to build the barn with red and blue blocks?
instead of
What color is that block? (only one correct answer)

• Who will live in the house you’re building?
• Why do you think the boy decided to follow the giant?
• What do you think the princess is feeling?
• How are you planning to attach the brown triangle to the pink

Expanding your child’s play
When you and your child are playing with blocks, trucks and cars

Ask:
• What kinds of buildings do these trucks need?
• Where are people in the car going?
• What will they do there?
• What do they need to take with them? Food? Clothing? Tools?
• Are they going alone or with others? Who?
• During the day, or at night? Will they go someplace different at
different times of day?

<p> Monopoly is a classic board game loved by people of all ages, but it can be pretty tough to learn to play! The rules are complicated, and many families have their own variations that aren't listed in the official rulebook. Learning how to set up the board, play by the official rules, and end the game at a reasonable time will help you learn to love Monopoly! </p>
<p> Find 2 to 8 players. Monopoly can be played with as few as 2 people up to 8 players at most. Each number of players brings its own advantages and drawbacks so it is important to know them before you decide on how many people are going to play.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> 2-person games are not recommended due to the nature and mechanics of the game. At the start of the game, both players will be evenly matched and find the game to last a long time. Once someone gets lucky or makes a great move, they usually win the game without a chance for their opponent to catch up. Do not let this deter you though if you only have two available players. It can still be very fun. </p>
<p> 3-5 person games are great because of their balance between fairness and enjoyment. Games can last over two hours if players are evenly matched and when someone appears to be winning, there's a lot of room for the losing players to stay in the game. </p>
<p> 6-8 person games are fun but can have a few problems. As only one person can win the game, more players means there will be more losers. Furthermore, there is a longer wait between turns, yet this isn't too much of an issue as Monopoly gives you a handful of options you can do when it's not your turn, until everyone wants to do an action at once. </p>
<p> Monopoly is intended to be played by people aged 8 or over. Younger players may not enjoy the game if they do not like to lose as the game requires some strategy to win. It is recommended to help new and young players by offering tips and opting for a more co-operative playstyle. </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Choose a banker. This player is in charge of all the money, property, houses, and hotels still belonging to the bank. The banker can still play the game, but they should make sure their own money is separate from the bank's.[2] X Research source If it is easier, the banker can place the box where most players can reach, allowing people to help themselves to money, houses and properties, providing that they only do this when they're allowed to. </p>
<p> Set up the board. Unfold the Monopoly board and lay it on a flat surface. Make sure each player has enough space to keep their money and property deeds in front of them. You should also lay out the Chance and Community Chest cards on the board. They are marked in the center. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Pick a game piece. Each player gets a game piece to move around the board. The game comes with a large selection, but you can also play with any small object. It does not matter what piece you choose as they all serve the same purpose.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> Give each player $1500. Before the game starts, the banker gives everybody their starting money. It should add up to $1500. Most players like to keep their lined up in front of them, but you can store your money any way you want as long as it is in front of you. Players may also exchange money for different bills of the same value. For example, giving $500 to the bank in exchange for 5 $100s. </p>
<p> Roll the dice to pick the first player. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first, and play then continues clockwise around the board. You can use two dice or one, whichever you prefer. A quicker alternative is for the youngest or newest player to go first. This skips the initial dice rolling and gives them a small advantage. After the first turn, play goes to the player on the left in a clockwise fashion.[4] X Research source </p>
<p> Roll the dice and move your game piece. Each player rolls the dice and moves their game piece the same number of spaces. If you roll doubles, you get to move again after resolving the space you have landed on. [5] X Research source </p>
<p> Look at the space you landed on. Monopoly has many different kinds of spaces. Most of them are properties that you can buy or pay rent on, but some of them require you to draw a card from one of two decks, collect money, or even go to jail. </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Buy an unowned property when you land on it. If you are the first one to land on a spot with a colored stripe across the top, a railroad, or a utility, you may buy the property for the amount printed on the board. The banker in turn gives the player the title deed for that property. Most players recommend buying every property you can as if you don't, the other players have a chance to get it for cheaper.[6] X Research source </p>
<p> Auction any unsold property. If you land on an unowned property but choose not to buy it, then the property is auctioned and awarded to the highest bidder. This rule is part of the official game but many people omit it at home.[7] X Research source </p>
<p> Whenever a player who lands on an unowned property opts not to buy it, the banker takes over and auctions it off immediately. The player who initially declined to buy the property at the printed price can still participate in the auction. Bids start at $1 and stop when no one wants to increase their bid. If absolutely no one wants the property, it returns to the bank and the game resumes. </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Collect rent. If you land on someone else's property, you must pay them the rent printed on the title deed card for that property (unless they have mortgaged the property). Rents vary according to the price of the property, whether or not a player has a complete color set (monopoly) and how many buildings have been built there. [8] X Research source </p>
<p> Buy all the properties in a colored group to get a monopoly. If you own all the properties in a colored group, you have a monopoly! This is one of the main goals of the game--you can bankrupt other players easily if you have a monopoly. Players with a monopoly get to charge double rent for their property on unimproved sites of that color set. The reason rent is so high when you have a monopoly is based on real life business as no competitors means no need to fight for the lower price.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> Build houses on your monopoly. If you have a monopoly, you can start to build houses on any of those properties to charge more rent. You can find the building prices on your property deed. You can build up to four houses on each property of your monopoly. [10] X Research source </p>
<p> Buildings raise the rent on your property significantly. For example, the first property on the board, Mediterranean Avenue, rents for $2 without any buildings. When you build four houses, you can charge $160 to each player who lands on it. </p>
<p> You have to build evenly--you can't build two houses on one property in your monopoly and none on the others. If you buy one building for a property, you can't put a second one on that property until you have bought a house for every property in your monopoly. </p>
<p> Build a hotel after you've built four houses. The most lucrative buildings you can add to your properties are hotels. After you've built four houses on each property, you can buy a hotel from the bank and replace the houses with them. A hotel is roughly equivalent to having five houses yet the maximum number of houses on a site is four. However, it is sometimes better to leave the four houses on each property instead of building the hotel if you wish to create a house shortage for other players. [11] X Research source </p>
<p> 9 </p>
<p> Collect $200 when you pass GO. Every time a player lands on or passes over the corner space marked "GO," they earn a $200 salary. This is a great way to add a little cash to your reserves![12] X Research source </p>
<p> According to the official rules, you only get $200 for passing or landing on the GO square, but many people allow you to collect more whenever you land right on GO. This house rule should be avoided as it can prolong the game in the bad sense of the word. </p>
<p> 10 </p>
<p> Take a Chance or Community Chest card. If you land on a spot marked "Chance" or "Community Chest," take the top card off of the corresponding deck of the space that you landed on. These cards have effects that can cause you to earn or lose money, move you across the track or even send you to jail. There's also the infamous "get out of jail free" card. When you're done reading the card, return it to the bottom of the corresponding deck.[13] X Research source </p>
<p> 11 </p>
<p> Go to jail. Going to jail prevents you from moving around the board until you're free. But you still can collect rent, buy houses, participate in auctions, and trade with other players. There are three possible ways to go to jail:[14] X Research source </p>
<p> Landing on the space marked "Go to Jail" is the most common way to end in jail. The player goes diagonally across the board to the jail space without passing GO, and their turn ends immediately. </p>
<p> If you pick a Chance or Community Chest card that reads this, your turn ends immediately and you must go directly to the space marked "In jail". If you pass GO on the way to jail, you don't get to collect your $200. Put your game piece inside the jail cell when you are sent to jail. </p>
<p> Rolling three consecutive doubles on the same turn also sends you to jail immediately. Place your token into the jail cell as soon as the third double is rolled. </p>
<p> If you just land on the jail space by an ordinary dice roll, you can place your token on the "Just Visiting" section of the square. You are not subject to any restrictions and can take your next turn as usual. </p>
<p> You can get out of jail by paying $50 bail, using a Get Out of Jail Free card, or rolling doubles on your next turn. If you succeed in rolling a double to get out of jail, you move forward the given number of spaces but do not take another turn. You must leave jail on your third turn and immediately pay $50 if you fail to roll doubles on that turn. </p>
<p> 12 </p>
<p> Make deals with other players. Trading with other players is a key part of the strategy of any Monopoly game. This is usually how you obtain a monopoly to build houses and hotels. Many players also have house rules that allow them to grant rent immunity to another player, lend money to another player, or borrow from the bank without mortgaging property.[15] X Research source </p>
<p> Do not include any house rules during your first game as including them can impact the enjoyment of the game and extend how long the game goes on for which isn't a good thing. </p>
<p> Set a time limit to determine the winner (optional). If you want a faster game, try setting a timer for 1 or 2 hours. When the timer goes off, each player counts their total amount of money, the printed prices of all their unmortgaged properties, half the prices of all their mortgaged properties, and the printed prices of all houses and hotels. The richest player wins the game! </p>
<p> If you do decide to play using a time limit, players' strategies can differ slightly. In a normal game of monopoly, the winner of the game could have a bad start and be very poor early on. You may want to declare the winner not to be the richest player but the one who made the best decisions, decided by your group democratically. </p>
<p> Do NOT award money for landing on Free Parking. Many people use a variation of the rules to add more money to the game. Instead of putting tax money or other payments back in the bank, they put it in the center of the board and give it to anyone who lands on Free Parking. While it's fun to win a pile of money, it actually makes the game go on for much longer! A game of Monopoly should only take about two hours.[16] X Research source </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Mortgage property. If you can't pay the rent when you land on a property, you can mortgage your property. You can also choose to mortgage a property to buy other properties, houses, or hotels. When a property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. To unmortgage it, you must pay 10% interest when you pay it off. If you have to pay a decimal, always round it up.[17] X Research source </p>
<p> Mortgages have their rewards and their consequences. You should only mortgage a property to avoid bankruptcy or to make a quick boost of money for buying more properties and trading. You can also sell your mortgaged properties to other players, causing them to pay the bank if they want to collect rent on that property. The 10% interest is far better than the 50% loss from selling buildings. </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Go bankrupt. If you owe more money than you and your assets can afford, you're declared bankrupt and are out of the game. In official rules, your money and properties are given to the player who caused you to become bankrupt after selling all the buildings first. However, this can cause a winning player to win even more. It is recommended that when a player becomes bankrupt, all of their property is auctioned off as this makes the game a bit more balanced for the remaining players.[18] X Research source </p>
<p> Many professional competitions play until there is a winner, but you can quit at any time. The winner would be the person with the most cash and property, as determined by the "Property Worth" on the back of each property card. </p>
<p> What happens when you land on a the "Income Tax" space? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> You have to pay the bank either10% of your current cash on hand or $200 if you prefer. So if you had $1,500 on hand, you would pay $150 (10% of $1,500). If you had $2,500, you would owe $250. However, you could choose to pay $200 instead. </p>
<p> Nothing. Or if you want, make up a rule like 'get $250 upon landing on Free Parking' but this must be agreed upon before commencing the game. </p>
<p> You have the mortgage value written on the back of the card. When you mortgage a property, put face down the title deed card of the property you're mortgaging, and then get the mortgaged value shown on the back. It also lists rent value. When people land on your property, they must pay you rent. The rent amount is shown on the TDC. If you have more than one property on a square, the card indicates how much rent you can charge for those properties. The cost of buying property is shown at the bottom of the Title Deed card. </p>
<p> Nothing. It's just a spot where you don't have to do anything at all. While some players put all money collected by the "income tax" spot here on Free Parking, giving it to whomever lands there, this is not an official rule. </p>
<p> Are you supposed to go around the board before you buy properties? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> That's a "house rule" that some people play by. This rule should be agreed upon before starting the game. </p>

<p> Tips </p>
<p> Do not include any house rules if it is your first time playing. They usually cause more harm than good. </p>
<p> Do not be afraid to forfeit the game if you are losing with little hope of coming back. You will have more time to plan to win your next game. </p>
<p> Most versions of monopoly change the artwork yet play the same. Make sure the version you are playing is using official rules. Do not include any advanced features such as speed die. </p>
<p> It may be beneficial to learn about strategies before playing but do not let them confuse you or spoil your entertainment. </p>
<p> Monopoly games come with a quick guide to the rules. Keep it out when you play to help you remember them! </p>
<p> If you are still confused with how to play the game, discuss the rules with a friend or watch someone play the game to understand how it works. </p>
<p> If the game is taking longer than you anticipated, feel free to take a break and come back to the game at a later date. </p>
<p> If you forget a rule or make a mistake, do not worry about it and continue playing with the forgotten rule in place. </p>
<p> All of the games pieces can be replicated with pen and paper if you manage to lose or damage one of them. </p>

<p> Monopoly is a 2-8 player board game where players buy properties and try to get the other players to go bankrupt. To start the game, choose one player to be the banker. The banker is responsible for changing out money, collecting bank fees, and distributing money for passing Go. The banker gives $1,500 to each player that's made up of two $500's, two $100's, 2 $50's, 6 $20's, 5 $10's, 5 $5's, and 5 $1's. Place the Chance and Community chest cards face-down on their spots in the middle of the board. Then, each player selects a token and places it on the Go space. Each player rolls a pair of dice and the player with the highest roll goes first. On a player's turn, they roll the dice and move their token that number of spaces. If the player lands on a utility, property, or railroad, they may purchase the deed from the bank and collect the card for that property. If they land on a Chance or Community Chest space, they draw a card from the corresponding pile and follow the instructions on the card. If a player can’t afford or doesn't want a property, utility, or railroad, the property goes up for auction. During an auction, each player can bid to buy the property. Whoever bids the highest amount wins and gets the property. If a player lands on a property, utility, or railroad that's already owned by another player, they owe that player the rent price listed on the deed. Players can increase the rent owed on their properties by owning a complete set of one color, called a monopoly, and buying houses and hotels on those properties. Whenever a player passes Go, they collect $200 from the bank. Once a player is done with their turn, the player to their left goes next. If a player rolls doubles, they roll again after their first turn is over. If a player rolls three doubles in a row, they go directly to the Jail space on the board. Players may also be sent to Jail by Chance or Community Chest cards or by landing on the Go to Jail space on the board. If a player ends up in Jail, they can either pay $50 to get out at the beginning of their next turn, or they can try rolling doubles on their next turn to get out for free. If they don't get doubles, they have to wait until their next turn to try again. If 3 turns go by and they still don't get doubles, that player pays $50 and leaves Jail. Players are allowed to trade properties with other players during their turn to try to build monopolies. If a player can't afford to buy a property or pay another player rent, they can mortgage their properties and collect the mortgage value from the bank. Players don't collect rent on mortgaged properties. If a player runs out of money at any point in the game, they lose. If they ran out of money by landing on another player's space, all of their property and remaining money goes to that player. The game continues until only one person is left in the game and wins!

<p> The board game Pictionary is fun to play with a group of three or more people. The game includes a game board, four playing pieces and category cards, a one minute sand timer and a die. It helps to have four drawing pads and pencils, but you can use any type of paper and pencils or even small dry-erase boards and markers. Understanding how to play Pictionary is easy once you learn how to set up the game and how to handle special situations, such as the “All Play” category. </p>
<p> Divide players into two teams. If you have a large number of players, you can form four teams, but the game is more fun with fewer teams and more players on each team. Select one person to be your picturist for the first word. The picturist is the person who attempts to illustrate the word using the pencil and paper. Everyone else on the team will try to guess the word that the picturist draws.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> Players on the team will take turns acting as the picturist. </p>
<p> If you only have three players, one person must be designated to draw for both teams during the entire game. </p>
<p> Supply each team with the proper playing equipment. Each team gets a category card, a pad of paper and a pencil. The category card explains the meanings of the category abbreviations that you see on the playing board and word cards.[2] X Research source </p>
<p> The different categories are (P) for person, place or animal; (O) for object; (A) for action, such as an event; (D) for difficult words; and (AP) for all play. </p>
<p> If you prefer, you can draw on a dry-erase board and marker instead of pencil and paper. </p>
<p> Set up the game. Place the game board and deck of word cards in the center of the group. Place a playing piece on the starting square of the Pictionary game board to represent each team. Since the starting space is labeled (P), each team will draw the person, place or animal category first.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> Determine if you will play by any special rules. Some people like to set special rules before starting a game in order to prevent any disputes later in the game. Talk to the other players about any house rules that you want to set before you start the game.[4] X Research source </p>
<p> For example, how picky will you be about words that other players call out? If a player calls out “baseball” and the word is “ball”, will that count or does the player need to say the exact word? </p>
<p> Roll the die to see which team selects the first card. Each team rolls the die once and the higher number plays first. The first word played will be an “All Play” word, but the team with the highest die roll gets to select the card.[5] X Research source </p>
<p> Do not move the game pieces on the board after the opening die roll. Leave them in the start space. </p>
<p> Let both team's picturists see the card. After the first card has been selected, both team's picturists should have a chance to look at the word for five seconds before they begin drawing. Do not start the timer until five seconds have passed and both picturists are ready to draw. </p>
<p> Have both team's picturists draw at the same time. When both team's picturists are ready, start the timer and instruct the picturists to start drawing. The picturists will have 60 seconds to draw while their teammates try to guess the word. The first team to guess the word correctly wins control of the die.[6] X Research source </p>
<p> Remember, do not advance any pieces during the first turn. The object of the first turn is to see who gets control of the die. </p>
<p> Decide who will draw for each team. Each team should decide on a turn order for picturists so that everyone gets a turn. During your team's turn, the picturist selects a word card from the front of the deck. The picturist may look at the word in the (P) category for up to five seconds, but may not allow any of his or her teammates to see it.[7] X Research source </p>
<p> Flip the timer over and begin drawing. Each picturist has one minute to draw their word as best they can. Teammates can guess continuously during the one minute drawing time. Keep in mind that picturists may not talk, use hand gestures, or write numbers or letters during their turns.[8] X Research source </p>
<p> If teammates guess the word on the card before the timer runs out, they get to roll the die, move the number of spaces indicated, then pick another card and draw again. </p>
<p> If teammates don't guess the word in time, they pass the die to the team on the left, who begins by drawing a word card. </p>
<p> Rotate who draws each time you need to pick a word card. Start each turn by picking a word card, not rolling the die. You only roll the die and move the playing piece when your team guesses the word before the timer runs out and your turn continues.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> Include all teams for “All Play” squares and cards. If you land on an “All Play” square or the word on the card has a triangle symbol next to it, then all of the teams get to compete. The picturists for each team get to look at the word card for five seconds. Then, start the timer and have the picturists from each team draw clues for their teammates.[10] X Research source </p>
<p> The team that guesses the word before the timer runs out gets to roll the die, move the spaces indicated by the die roll, and pick a new word card. </p>
<p> Continue to play Pictionary until a team reaches the final "All Play" square. Once a team reaches the "All Play" square, they are eligible to win the game. Keep in mind that your team does not have to land on this square with an exact roll of the die. If your team doesn't guess the word guess the word, then play continues with the team to the left.[11] X Research source </p>
<p> Win by guessing the word in the final “All Play” on your team's turn. It may take several tries before your team guesses the word and you may be in competition with other teams that are also on the final square. Keep trying until someone wins the game.[12] X Research source </p>

<p> No, the players cannot use words in Pictionary. The whole point of the game is to guess words by drawing pictures. Some people use dashes to indicate the amount of letters to be guessed, as part of the drawing, but that’s about as far as the guessing help should go! </p>

<p> The aim of the game Pictureka is to win the most cards or to be the first to collect six cards. To do this, you need to be able to quickly find characters and objects which are hidden on the tiles, and each find allows you to win cards. When you find them, you need to shout out "Pictureka!" before another player does, winning yourself a card. The game is played both in competition with other players and under timed conditions, so it feels a bit like a race. For the official rules, which are too long to explain in a short answer, check the rules booklet accompanying the game or look online. It is also possible to combine Pictureka with other games, in which case you’ll need to combine rule sets as well. </p>

<p> If you don’t mind the game being less competitive and more about just having fun drawing and guessing, then you could have a 2-player Pictionary game. Swap the roles of drawing and guessing between you each turn and just enjoy the game for the fun of it rather than adding up scores too seriously. </p>

<p> Pictionary is a fun game where players try to guess what other players are drawing. To play Pictionary, first split up into two teams with at least two players on each team. Each team selects a game piece and places it on the “Start” square. Then, each team selects one member to be the artist for the first round. The artist on one of the teams draws a card and shows it to all of the other artist. Then, the timer is flipped over and each artist begins drawing the word from the card. As they're drawing, players on their team try to guess what it is out loud. The first team to guess correctly rolls the die and moves their token that many squares. Then, that team chooses a new artist and the artist pulls a new card. The color of the square that team is on determines which word on the card the artist must draw. The timer is flipped over and the new artist begins drawing. Only the playing team is allowed to guess what the word is this time. If the team guesses correctly before the time runs out, they roll again and repeat the process with a new artist. If the team doesn’t guess correctly, the turn passes clockwise to the next team. Whenever a player lands on a square with the four-pencil “All” symbol next to it, each team has an opportunity to draw and guess the word. The first team to guess gets to roll a die, move their piece, and continue playing. The first team to make it to the end of the board wins! To play Pictionary without the board, each team takes turns separately. The opposing team comes up with something to draw and writes it down on a piece of scrap paper. The team that is drawing selects an artist, and the opposing team gives them the word. The artist has 60 seconds to draw it out while their team guesses. If the team can correctly guess what the drawing is within 60 seconds, they get 1 point. Then, the next team goes and the team that just went writes the word down. Play continues until a team reaches 5 or 10 points depending on how long you want the game to be. For tips on handling the "All Play" category, read on! </p>

<p> Poker is a popular game that’s easy to learn but difficult to master. Although it’s a card game, poker is also a game of strategy, and you'll need to constantly read the other players to decide when to fold, when to bluff, and when to call someone else’s bluff. There are many variations of poker, but Texas Hold’em is the most popular. While each variation has its own rules, the basics of the game are always the same. All you have to do is master the basics - then you can start developing your own winning strategy! </p>
<p> Learn the 10 basic 5-card hands and their ranking. No matter what type of poker you play, the hands will always be the same. To start familiarizing yourself with the different hands, print out a "cheat sheet" and study it. Then, memorize the different hands so you can easily recognize them. Here are the winning poker hands, from highest to lowest: </p>
<p> The highest-ranking hand is a royal flush (the royal straight flush). This hand includes a 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace of the same suit, one kind (all clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades). It can only be tied but not beaten by the royal flush of another suit. </p>
<p> A straight flush is made up of 5 consecutive cards of the same suit. </p>
<p> 4 of a kind means you have 4 cards of the same rank (but different suits, of course) and a fifth card of any rank (such as 4 aces and a 9). If you have 4 aces, then no one can have any hand with an ace, so that no royal flush is available. </p>
<p> A full house contains 3 matching cards of 1 rank and 2 matching cards of another rank. </p>
<p> A flush contains any 5 cards of the same suit. These skip around in rank or sequence, but are from the same suit. </p>
<p> A straight contains 5 cards of consecutive rank but from more than one suit. </p>
<p> 3 of a kind means you have 3 cards of the same rank, plus two unmatched cards. </p>
<p> 2 pair is made up of two cards of one rank, plus two cards of another rank (different from the first pair), plus one unmatched card. </p>
<p> Pair means you have 2 cards of the same rank, plus 3 other unmatched cards. </p>
<p> High card is the lowest-ranking (called a "nothing") hand, when no two cards have the same rank, the five cards are not consecutive, and they are not all from the same suit. </p>
<p> Tip: Keep in mind that if two people face off with the same type of hand, the hand with the higher-ranking cards wins. If the hands have the exact same ranks of cards (suit does not matter), it is a tie and the prize, if any, is split evenly. </p>
<p> Place the blinds (starting bets) or "ante up." In poker, bets are placed at the beginning of the game in one of 2 ways. In Texas Hold’em, the player next to the dealer typically places a small blind bet that’s half of the usual minimum bet, while the player to that person’s left places a big blind that’s at least the minimum bet. As another option, each player can “ante up” the minimum starting bet, which means placing a minimum starting bet into the pool.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> Aside from Texas Hold’em, most poker variants use an “ante up” system. </p>
<p> Look at the 2 cards the dealer gives you, which is your hand. The dealer will "burn" the first card on the deck, which means placing it out of play. Then, they'll pass out 2 cards to each player. Check your cards to see what you're holding.[2] X Research source </p>
<p> In poker, the dealer will burn a card every round of dealing. That way, it’s harder for players to anticipate what card is coming up and the game becomes more of a gamble. </p>
<p> The dealer will always pass out the cards in a clockwise direction, starting on the left. </p>
<p> Tip: Players don’t show their hands to anyone else until they reach the showdown. Even if another player is out, it’s best to keep your cards a secret. You don’t want them to accidentally (or purposely) reveal the value of your cards. </p>
<p> Bet, call, or raise after each round is dealt if you want to. Every time the dealer puts out new cards, you'll make a bet, with the first bet being made solely based on the two cards the players have in their hands. Betting happens in a circle – when it's your turn to bet, you have a few options. At this point you can:[3] X Research source </p>
<p> Place an initial bet if no one else has yet. </p>
<p> Say "check" to avoid betting. </p>
<p> Say "call" to match the bet someone else has made. </p>
<p> Say "raise" to add more money to the betting pool. If you "raise," the other players will go around in a circle and choose to either "call" your new bet or fold. </p>
<p> Say "fold" if someone else has bet and you don't want to match their bet. If you fold, turn your cards into the dealer face-down to avoid giving the other players any advantages! </p>
<p> Look at the “flop” to see if you have a good hand. After the first round of betting, the dealer will "burn" the top card on the deck. Then, they'll put 3 cards face-up on the table, which is called the "flop." These are the community cards that every player can use to build their hand. Compare these cards and the cards in your hand, then place a bet, call a bet, or fold.[4] X Research source </p>
<p> In total, the dealer will reveal 5 cards. You will have 7 cards total to use to create your best hand of 5: your two personal cards in your hands, and the five community cards on the table. While your luck can turn later on in a game, take some time to analyze the table after the "flop" – are you well-positioned to end the game with a good hand? </p>
<p> Depending on the rules where you’re playing, you can also draw replacement cards for the cards in your hand. This is usually done during or just after the betting round. </p>
<p> Check the “turn” card after the second round of betting. The dealer will "burn" the top card, then they'll place 1 card face up next to the flop. This is called the “turn” card or the “fourth street” card. Check all of the cards on the table and the cards in your hand to see if you want to bet, call, or raise.[5] X Research source </p>
<p> Your game may also allow a card exchange at this point, but this isn’t typical in professional games. </p>
<p> As you look at the cards, think about the possible hands other players might have. For instance, if all 4 cards on the table are spades, then any player who has a spade in their hand will have a flush, which means they have 5 cards from the same house. </p>
<p> Similarly, if the cards on the table are 5,6,7, and 8, then anyone with a 4 or 9 will have a straight. </p>
<p> If you have nothing good in your hand but the cards on the table make for an easy winning hand, then you may want to fold, as it’s likely another player has a winning card. </p>
<p> Examine the "river" card and decide on the hand you'll play. After the dealer "burns" the top card on the deck, they'll put 1 last card face up next to the “turn” card. This final card is called the “river.” Check your hand and the community cards to decide on your best 5-card hand. Then, bet, call, or fold.[6] X Research source </p>
<p> If the rules allow it, you may be able to exchange your hand 1 final time before or after betting. However, this isn’t common in professional games. </p>
<p> Reveal each player’s hand clockwise in the final “showdown.” After each player calls, folds, or bets in the last round, each remaining player will participate in the “showdown.” Starting to the left of the dealer, all players involved will reveal their cards face up. Then, everyone looks at the turned over hands to see who has the highest value hand to win the entire pot.[7] X Research source </p>
<p> If there is a tie, the tied players split the pot. </p>
<p> If you fold your hand, then you don’t have to show your cards. </p>
<p> In Texas Hold’em, there are 5 cards on the table and 2 cards in your hand. You can create any 5-card combination using these 7 cards. The remaining cards aren’t counted. </p>
<p> If you want to play the cards on the table only, this is called “playing the board.” However, it’s an option that everyone has, so it may not be the best strategy. </p>
<p> Guesstimate the risks on your starting hand. Look at your cards to see what you’re holding. Check for a pair, 2 consecutive numbers, cards that are from the same house, or face cards, which may be good cards. Then, decide if it’s worth placing a bet to see what the community cards will be. </p>
<p> You should almost always raise when your hand is a pair, face cards, or aces. An ace and a king or an ace and a queen are strong hands as well. If you have these hands, bet before the flop to raise the value of the pot. </p>
<p> If the card you need doesn’t turn up, you can either bluff or fold. Sometimes, with good bluffing skills and some luck, a bad hand can win the whole game. </p>
<p> Start the bidding with the player to the left of the big blind or dealer. On the first round, bidding starts to the left of the big blind. In later rounds, the bidding starts to the left of the dealer. From there, the bidding goes clockwise.[8] X Research source </p>
<p> If you’re playing a game with an ante instead of a blind, always start betting with the player to the left of the dealer. </p>
<p> Call the bet if you want to stay in but don’t have great cards. This means you want to stay in the game but don’t want to raise the bet. When you call, match the bet of the person before you by adding your chips or money to the pot. Your turn is now over.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> If the flop comes and you’re holding a hand that doesn’t play, check and fold. You don’t want to keep betting money at a hand that won’t win. </p>
<p> If the flop comes and you have a strong hand, bet at it. This will force weaker hands out and raise the value of your pot. </p>
<p> Raise the bet if you have a good hand. When the bet comes to you, tell the other players you want to raise. Then, say how much you are betting and place your money or chips into the pot. This ends your turn.[10] X Research source </p>
<p> Say, “I raise the bet to $30.” </p>
<p> You can’t raise the bet above the maximum for your game. </p>
<p> Variation: You might decide to go ahead and raise the bet to trick everyone into thinking you have good cards. This is called “bluffing.” It’s a strategy used to win a hand even with bad cards. You can “bluff” at any point in the game, but it’s a risky strategy because your bluff might get called. </p>
<p> Fold if the current bet is too high or you have a bad hand. This means quitting the round of poker. To fold, place your cards face down on the table and say, “I fold.” Then, add your cards to the discard pile.[11] X Research source </p>
<p> Don’t show your cards when you fold during a game, as this can spoil which cards are out of play. That may give certain players an upper hand. </p>
<p> The key to being successful at poker is knowing when to fold your hand and accept a smaller loss or when to hold onto it and risk a larger loss for a chance to win the pot. </p>
<p> Decide if you want to draw any cards (if the game allows it). Look at your cards and decide if you want to play this hand. If you’d like to try for better cards, discard the cards you don’t want. Then, draw replacement cards from the draw pile at the center of the table. [12] X Research source </p>
<p> You can discard as many cards as you’d like. </p>
<p> You may not be allowed to draw new cards when playing Texas Hold’em, so check the rules for your game before you start playing. </p>
<p> Play only with money you’re willing to lose. When you are learning, you should never gamble more than you would consider acceptable to lose. During the game, don’t add to your bankroll or dive back in after losing everything you planned to gamble. Wait until you’re comfortable losing that amount again before you play another game. </p>
<p> The general rule of thumb is you should be able to easily afford to lose 200 bets at the highest limit. So if the limit is $5 bets, then your bankroll should be $1000, and stop there. </p>
<p> Track your wins and losses if you start getting more serious about poker. This will help you figure out whether you are winning or losing in the long run. </p>
<p> Remember that you must keep records and pay taxes on your gambling income to avoid legal trouble. </p>
<p> Learn to read basic tells. Playing your opponents is arguably even more important than playing your cards in poker. This is a more advanced aspect of the game, but it’s always good to be aware of players’ tells—especially your own. Watch for betting patterns such as betting early, very often (probably with weak hands), or late in a hand (as intimidation). Physical tells can also give you an estimation of your opponent’s strength of hand and help you keep your own strategy secret by avoiding such patterns.[13] X Research source </p>
<p> Some classic tells include shallow breathing, sighing, nostrils flaring, flushing red, eyes watering, blinking, swallowing excessively, or an increasing pulse seen in the neck or temple. </p>
<p> A hand over the mouth is usually to conceal a smile, while shaking hands usually reveal nerves. </p>
<p> If a player glances at his or her chips when the flop comes, they probably have a strong hand. </p>
<p> If a mediocre player tries to impress you by staring you down, they are likely bluffing. </p>
<p> Identify conservative players from aggressive players. This will help you determine players' betting patterns and read them more easily. You can tell if players are more conservative by noticing those folding early—evidently only staying in a hand when their cards are good. </p>
<p> Very conservative players won’t lose as much money, but they're easily spotted by more experienced players. Because they tend to avoid high betting, they can often be bluffed into folding. </p>
<p> Aggressive players are risk-takers that often bet high early in a hand before seeing how the other players are acting on their cards. </p>
<p> Practice and watch others play to develop quick instincts. The more you play and watch, the faster and better you’ll get. Since every poker game is different, it’s important to develop good instincts rather than try to memorize and apply tricky systems. Observe experienced players and imagine how you’d react in their position. Then, watch how the experienced players react to build your own instincts. </p>
<p> While you do this, consider how successful you’d have been if you were playing and reacted as you did. Would you have won, or would you have lost? Then, decide how you can improve your strategy going forward. </p>
<p> Shuffle the cards and cut the deck before they’re dealt. Shuffling the cards mixes them up to make the game fairer. To do a basic shuffle, split the deck into 2 stacks. Next, hold a stack in each hand close together and facing each other. Use your thumbs to flip through the cards, combining the deck into one. After the cards are shuffled, get someone who isn’t the dealer to cut the deck by separating it into 2 stacks and placing the bottom stack on top.[14] X Research source </p>
<p> Do several shuffles to make sure the cards are mixed up. </p>
<p> You can cut the deck more than once if you’d like. </p>
<p> The dealer typically does the shuffling and bets last, which is called the “button” position. After each hand, you’ll pass the dealer/button position to the next player on the left. If the dealer is always the same person, like in a casino, the button position will still pass clockwise around the table. </p>
<p> Say “check" to skip placing a bet or simply tap the table twice with two fingers. You can say this if you are the first better or if all those already betting have checked. If you say "check" when it's your turn at the beginning of a new hand, that means you are choosing not to place a bet at that point. Instead, you pass the chance to open to the next player. </p>
<p> In the following rounds, if you say “check,” that means you’re staying with the bets you already paid into the pot during this hand, and you won’t pay more until someone else raises during their turn. </p>
<p> If another player does raise on that hand, then you nor anyone else can say "check" or maintain your “check”—so when the play comes around to you again you have to either match or raise the latest bet or fold your hand. </p>
<p> Say "I open" if a bet hasn’t been placed yet and you want to open too betting. For example, you could raise the ante $1 or at least the agreed minimum raise. If you choose not to open, take turns in clockwise order, until someone else has opened or every player checked. If everyone checks, then it is time to choose to discard and draw 1 to 3 cards, or "hold pat" on the cards you have. When there are fewer than 3 cards available to draw, replacements will be drawn. </p>
<p> The dealer will have to shuffle the discards and add them to the bottom of the draw stack. </p>
<p> Say “call” if you want to bet the same as the last person. Calling means making a bet equal to the last bet or raise. For example, if the person right of you just bet $10 and it's now your turn, you would say "call" or “I call” to match that bet. Then you would place $10 in chips or cash in the pot. </p>
<p> “Raise” to increase the current betting amount. This is also known as “sweetening the pot.” Raise or re-raise requires finishing this round and making another round to now allow any others to "call" or "raise" the amount of that last bet to stay in the game, or else "fold". The ones who already called can check on this turn and the hand is finished unless someone re-raises.[15] X Research source </p>
<p> If someone before you bets $20 and you think you have a winning hand or you want to bluff, you can raise when it's your turn by saying “raise to $30.” </p>
<p> However, do not say “I see your 20, and I’ll raise you 10…” Despite being popular in movies, this is actually frowned upon as sloppy table talk.[16] X Research source </p>
<p> Say “I fold” when you're ready to quit a hand. Folding means forfeiting your cards and giving up that pot with any bets you've made into it. Wait to be dealt into the next hand if you have chips or have not reached your limit of losses. To fold when it’s your turn, put your cards face down on the table and place them onto the discard pile.[17] X Research source </p>
<p> You can fold at any point in a hand when it’s your turn. </p>
<p> “Cash-in” when you’re ready to quit the game. This means exchanging your poker chips for money. If you still have chips but don’t want to play anymore, take your chips to the bank and tell them you’re ready to cash in. The bank will determine how much money your chips represent, then they’ll hand you cash.[18] X Research source </p>
<p> You can usually return and watch the game after you cash in. </p>
<p> Master the basics of five-card draw. This variation has optional rules that can be agreed on before the game begins, such as whether or not to use jokers and wildcards, or which cards are high and low. The object of the game is similar to Texas Hold ‘Em: to get the best 5-card hand, but within the bounds of your own 5-card hand, without common cards. </p>
<p> Determine the betting structure by deciding if you’ll play fixed-limit, pot-limit, or no-limit.[19] X Research source </p>
<p> Decide on the dealer by asking "Who deals first?". Depending on the group you’re with and where you’re playing, a dealer may be elected or each player could draw for the position. The organizer or host may also choose to deal first. </p>
<p> Learn 3-card draw. In this game, the players start by making an ante bet. The dealer and each of the players then get 3 cards, and the players must decide whether to make a play bet or fold. Finally, the dealer reveals their cards for a showdown and whoever has the best hand wins.[20] X Research source </p>
<p> Like with a 5-card draw, you can choose to vary the rules if you’re playing at home. For instance, jokers can be wild, meaning they can be used in represent any card value. </p>
<p> Study some of the more obscure variations. If you really get into the game or just want to impress others with your knowledge of poker, learn the rules of the other variations. These include Straight Poker, 5-Card Stud, 7-Card Stud, Lowball, Omaha, Pineapple, Crazy Pineapple, Cincinnati, and Dr. Pepper. </p>

<p> Community Q&A </p>
<p> Can I get the order of a poker hand from the highest to the lowest? </p>
<p> Poker Legend </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> 1. Royal flush. 2. Straight flush. 3. Four of a kind. 4. Full house. 5. Flush. 6. Straight. 7. Three of a kind. 8. Two pair. 9. Pair. 10. High card. </p>
<p> Royal flush is the best type of hand you can get. For example: Ace, king, queen, Jack, and ten, all of the same suit. </p>
<p> No. Two aces will beat any two of a kind as a high card, but three of a kind will still win. </p>
<p> Yes, unless your party decides aces become the value 1, rather than the highest possible (after king). </p>
<p> Unless there are wild cards in the game, if you have 4 aces, no one can have a royal flush. However, the royal flush would win. </p>
<p> To fold is to quit that round, forfeiting what you have placed in the pot and that round of dealing. You can still play in the next round. To fold you place your cards in the discard pile and declare to other players that you have folded. You do not have to show them your cards. </p>
<p> Who deals if the next dealer dropped out of the game? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> To keep the flow the same, have the previous dealer deal again. This keeps the cards flowing in the proper order. </p>

<p> You may also want to appoint a scorekeeper to track amounts gained and lost, as well as tally the standings. </p>
<p> You can bluff, or trick the other players into believing you have a powerful hand, by placing high bets. If they fall for it, they'll fold and you'll take the pot with a weak hand. </p>
<p> Select a "banker" if it is not a cash game. That person will issue and keep the supply of chips under lock and key. </p>
<p> Don't bet more than you are willing to lose—fold for that hand if some extremely high betting starts. </p>
<p> Watching professional poker players in tournaments is a great way to examine the dynamics of the game. You can watch these on TV or online. </p>

<p> Before you get started playing any type of 5-card poker, you’ll need to learn the 10 basic ways to win. In order from lowest to highest, they are: </p>
<p> 1. High card. 2. Pair of cards, like two 2s. 3. Two pairs of cards, like two 5s and two 9s. 4. Three of a kind, like three 4s. 5. Straight, which is five cards in sequential order. For example, a player might have a 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of any suit. 6. Flush, which is when a player has five cards of the same suit in any order. For example, a player might have a 2, 7, 10, Jack, and Queen of spades. 7. Full house, which is when a player has a pair and a three of a kind. 8. Four of a kind, like all four Aces. 9. Straight flush, which is when you have five cards in sequential order of the same suit. For example, a player might have a 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of clubs. 10. Royal Flush, which is a straight flush containing a 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. </p>
<p> If two people have the same hand, the person with the higher cards wins. So for example, if Daniel has a pair of 3s and Maggie has a pair of 10s, Maggie wins because her pair is higher. </p>
<p> To play Texas Hold’Em, which is the most common type of poker, you’ll first need to bet your “ante,” which is your “buy in bet” to play the round. The ante is usually a small bet, like $1 or $5, and it’s decided by the table. Once everyone has their ante, the dealer will deal two cards to each player. Keep these cards secret from everyone else. Now, every player will take a look at their cards and choose whether or not to bet. Whenever there’s a betting round, you can choose to “fold,” which means not playing this round, “check,” which means matching their bet, or “raise,” which means adding more money to the betting pool. Players that are unwilling to “check” a bet have to fold; and if everyone but one player “folds,” that player wins! Once everyone has bet, the dealer will reveal three cards. These cards are known as the “flop.” When you see the flop, start planning what hand you want to make, keeping in mind that there are still two more cards to be revealed. For example, you might want to aim for a flush, which is when you have five cards of the same suit. After the flop, everyone has the chance to bet again, before the dealer reveals the next card, which is the “turn.” Bet again if you want to, then the dealer will reveal the “river,” which is the last card. At this point, you’ll see a total of 7 cards: two in your hands, and five on the table. Now, players will bet once last time, then everyone will reveal their hand. Your goal is to create the highest hand possible out of those seven cards, even if it means only using one card from your hand and four cards from the table. The player with the best hand wins! </p>

<p> Shakespeare's Plays </p>
<p> Before the publication of the First Folio in 1623, nineteen of the thirty-seven plays in Shakespeare's canon had appeared in quarto format. With the exception of Othello (1622), all of the quartos were published prior to the date of Shakespeare's retirement from the theatre in about 1611. It is unlikely that Shakespeare was involved directly with the printing of any of his plays, although it should be noted that two of his poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece were almost certainly printed under his direct supervision. </p>
<p> Here you will find the complete text of Shakespeare's plays, based primarily on the First Folio, and a variety of helpful resources, including extensive explanatory notes, character analysis, source information, and articles and book excerpts on a wide range of topics unique to each drama. </p>
<p> Tragedies </p>
<p> Antony and Cleopatra (1607-1608) The story of Mark Antony, Roman military leader and triumvir, who is madly in love with Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Coriolanus (1607-1608) The last of Shakespeare's great political tragedies, chronicling the life of the mighty warrior Caius Marcius Coriolanus. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Hamlet (1600-1601) Since its first recorded production, Hamlet has engrossed playgoers, thrilled readers, and challenged actors more so than any other play in the Western canon. No other single work of fiction has produced more commonly used expressions. Earliest known text: Quarto (1603). </p>
<p> Julius Caesar (1599-1600) Although there were earlier Elizabethan plays on the subject of Julius Caesar and his turbulent rule, Shakespeare's penetrating study of political life in ancient Rome is the only version to recount the demise of Brutus and the other conspirators. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> King Lear (1605-1606) The story of King Lear, an aging monarch who decides to divide his kingdom amongst his three daughters, according to which one recites the best declaration of love. Earliest known text: Quarto (1608). </p>
<p> Macbeth (1605-1606) Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's most stimulating and popular dramas. Renaissance records of Shakespeare's plays in performance are scarce, but a detailed account of an original production of Macbeth has survived, thanks to Dr. Simon Forman. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Othello (1604-1605) Othello, a valiant Moorish general in the service of Venice, falls prey to the devious schemes of his false friend, Iago. Earliest known text: Quarto (1622). </p>
<p> Romeo and Juliet (1594-1595) Celebrated for the radiance of its lyric poetry, Romeo and Juliet was tremendously popular from its first performance. The sweet whispers shared by young Tudor lovers throughout the realm were often referred to as "naught but pure Romeo and Juliet." Earliest known text: Quarto (1597). </p>
<p> Timon of Athens (1607-1608) Written late in Shakespeare's career, Timon of Athens is criticized as an underdeveloped tragedy, likely co-written by George Wilkins or Cyril Tourneur. Read the play and see if you agree. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Titus Andronicus (1593-1594) A sordid tale of revenge and political turmoil, overflowing with bloodshed and unthinkable brutality. The play was not printed with Shakespeare credited as author during his lifetime, and critics are divided between whether it is the product of another dramatist or simply Shakespeare's first attempt at the genre. Earliest known text: Quarto (1594). </p>
<p> Histories </p>
<p> Henry IV, Part I (1597-1598) One of Shakespeare's most popular plays, featuring the opportunistic miscreant, Sir John Falstaff. Earliest known text: Quarto (1598). </p>
<p> Henry IV, Part II (1597-1598) This is the third play in the second tetralogy of history plays, along with Richard II, Henry IV, Part 1, and Henry V. Earliest known text: Quarto (1600). </p>
<p> Henry V (1598-1599) Henry V is the last in the second tetralogy sequence. King Henry is considered Shakespeare's ideal monarch. Earliest known text: Quarto (1600). </p>
<p> Henry VI, Part I (1591-1592) The first in Shakespeare's trilogy about the War of the Roses between the houses of Lancaster and York. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Henry VI, Part II (1590-1591) Part two of Shakespeare's chronicle play. Based on Hall's work, the play contains some historical inaccuracies. Earliest known text: Quarto (1594). </p>
<p> Henry VI, Part III (1590-1591) Part three begins in medias res, with the duke of Suffolk dead and the duke of York being named Henry VI's heir. Earliest known text: Quarto (1595). </p>
<p> Henry VIII (1612-1613) Many believe Henry VIII to be Shakespeare's last play, but others firmly believe that he had little, if anything, to do with its creation. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> King John (1596-1597) In the shadow of Shakespeare's second tetralogy of history plays lies the neglected masterpiece, King John. Although seldom read or performed today, King John was once one of Shakespeare's most popular histories, praised for its poetic brilliance. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Richard II (1595-1596) More so than Shakespeare's earlier history plays, Richard II is notable for its well-rounded characters. Earliest known text: Quarto (1597). </p>
<p> Richard III (1592-1593) The devious machinations of the deformed villain, Richard, duke of Gloucester, made this play an Elizabethan favorite. Earliest known text: Quarto (1597). </p>
<p> Comedies </p>
<p> All's Well That Ends Well (1602-1603) In 1767, a scholar named Richard Farmer concluded that this play is really the revision of Shakespeare's missing Love's Labour's Won, which was likely written around 1592. It is considered a problem play, due primarily to the character Helena and her ambiguous nature. Is she a virtuous lady or a crafty temptress? Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> As You Like It (1599-1600) As You Like It is considered by many to be one of Shakespeare's greatest comedies, and the heroine, Rosalind, is praised as one of his most inspiring characters. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> The Comedy of Errors (1592-1593) This is Shakespeare's shortest play, which he based on Menaechmi by Plautus. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Cymbeline (1609-1610) This play, modeled after Boccaccio's Decameron, is often classified as a romance. It features the beautiful Imogen, considered by many to be Shakespeare's most admirable female character. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Love's Labour's Lost (1594-1595) Love's Labour's Lost is a play of witty banter and little plot, written during the early part of Shakespeare's literary career, when his focus was on fancy conceits and the playful nature of love. Earliest known text: Quarto (1598). </p>
<p> Measure for Measure (1604-1605) Considered a "dark" comedy, Measure for Measure was inspired by Cinthio's Epitia and Whetstone's Promos and Cassandra. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> The Merchant of Venice (1596-1597) The character of Shylock has raised a debate over whether the play should be condemned as anti-Semitic, and this controversy has overshadowed many other aspects of the play. Earliest known text: Quarto (1600). </p>
<p> The Merry Wives of Windsor (1600-1601) The Merry Wives is unique amongst Shakespeare's plays because it is set in Shakespeare's England. It features the Bard's beloved character, Falstaff. Earliest known text: Quarto (1602). </p>
<p> A Midsummer Night's Dream (1595-1596) A magical exploration of the mysteries of love, and one of Shakespeare's best-known comedies. Earliest known text: Quarto (1600). </p>
<p> Much Ado About Nothing (1598-1599) The story of two very different sets of lovers, Beatrice and Benedick and Claudio and Hero. The witty banter between Beatrice and Benedick is the highlight of the play. Earliest known text: Quarto (1600). </p>
<p> Pericles, Prince of Tyre (1608-1609) Portions of Pericles are ripe with imagery and symbolism but the first three acts and scenes v and vi (the notorious brothel scenes) of Act IV are considered inadequate and likely the work of two other dramatists. The play was not included in the First Folio of 1623. In Shakespeare's sources, Pericles is named Apollonius. Earliest known text: Quarto (1609). </p>
<p> The Taming of the Shrew (1593-1594) The Taming of the Shrew revolves around the troubled relationship between Katharina and her suitor, Petruchio, who is determined to mold Katharina into a suitable wife. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> The Tempest (1611-1612) Hailed as a stunning climax to the career of England's favorite dramatist, The Tempest is a play praising the glories of reconciliation and forgiveness. Some believe that Prospero's final speeches signify Shakespeare's personal adieu from the stage. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Troilus and Cressida (1601-1602) Troilus and Cressida is difficult to categorize because it lacks elements vital to both comedies and tragedies. But, for now, it is classified as a comedy. Earliest known text: Quarto (1609). </p>
<p> Twelfth Night (1599-1600) Shakespeare loved to use the device of mistaken identity, and nowhere does he use this convention more skillfully than in Twelfth Night. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Two Gentlemen of Verona (1594-1595) The tale of two friends who travel to Milan and learn about the chaotic world of courting. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> The Winter's Tale (1610-1611) The Winter's Tale is considered a romantic comedy, but tragic elements are woven throughout the play. We have a first-hand account of a production of the play at the Globe in 1611. It is one of Shakespeare's final plays. Earliest known text: First Folio (1623). </p>
<p> Today's Guess the Play </p>
<p> Show the Answer </p>
<p> Quote in Context </p>
<p> If music be the food of love, play on; Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die. That strain again! Twelfth Night (1.1), Duke Orsino </p>
<p> Orsino, the Duke of Illyria, is consumed by his passion for the melancholy Countess Olivia. His ostentatious musings on the nature of love begin with what has become one of Shakespeare's most famous lines: "If music be the food of love, play on." It is apparent that Orsino's love is hollow. He is a romantic dreamer, for whom the idea of being in love is most important. When Valentine gives him the terrible news that Olivia plans to seclude herself for seven years to mourn her deceased brother, Orsino seems unfazed, and hopes Olivia may one day be as bewitched by love (the one self king) as he. Fittingly, the scene ends with Orsino off to lay in a bed of flowers, where he can be alone with his love-thoughts. Later in the play it will be up to Viola to teach Orsino the true meaning of love. </p>

<p> Bard Bites </p>
<p> Although The Two Noble Kinsmen likely was written in 1613, the first printing of the play did not occur until 1634, when "the memorable worthies of their time, Mr John Fletcher, and Mr William Shakespeare, Gent." were credited as co-authors on the title page. It is now generally accepted that Fletcher wrote the majority of the play, while Shakespeare wrote most of Act 1 (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) and Act 5, with the exception of Scene 2. ___ </p>
<p> The average length of a play in Elizabethan England was 3000 lines. With 4,042 lines and 29,551 words, Hamlet is the longest Shakespearean play (based on the first edition of The Riverside Shakespeare (1974)). With 1,787 lines and 14,369 words, The Comedy of Errors is the shortest Shakespearean play (also based on the first edition of The Riverside Shakespeare). ___ </p>

<p> plays </p>
<p> Many BGG users enjoy keeping track of the games they play (by date and number of times played). Then there are various reports you can see to observe your gaming history. </p>
<p> How to log plays </p>
<p> You can log plays from the game's individual BGG page, via the "Log Play" button (which also shows how many plays you already have logged). </p>
<p> You can also log plays via your own BGG collection. From the "My Geek" section at the top of your BGG profile, choose "Collection." A list of the games you own will be displayed. Choose the row for the game you want to log in and click in the cell under the "Your Plays" column, two from the right side of the screen. A dialog box will come up and you can log your play there. </p>
<p> You can also search for the game (via the "SEARCH Board Game" at the top of many BGG pages), then in the list of search results, click in that game's cell in the column "Your Plays" to get a popup dialog box. </p>
<p> There exist various other third party software for logging as well. </p>
<p> How to delete logged plays </p>
<p> To delete a logged play, go to any of the pages that show your logged plays (e.g. My Geek | Games Played | By Date) and then you can Edit or Delete the logged play(s). </p>
<p> Why log plays? </p>
<p> Different people log for different reasons. There are many forum threads discussing this, e.g. this one and this one. Common reasons include: </p>
<p> Pure geeky statistical fun. </p>
<p> See which of your games don't get played. (Perhaps as a nudge to play them - or to get rid of them.) </p>
<p> See the reality of what you play, compared to people's very faulty memories of what they play. </p>
<p> See how much "money's worth" or hours of playing you get out of your games. </p>
<p> Keep track of wins and losses, perhaps to track one's progress or for a local group's tournament or ratings. </p>
<p> Like a diary, it's enjoyable nostalgia to reread and remember old sessions. </p>
<p> Comment about strategy ideas and track your evolving strategy ideas over time. </p>
<p> Policies about logged plays </p>
<p> There are no rules and no general consensus about questions like: </p>
<p> Sessions with multiple plays of a given game, e.g. playing Blokus 3 times in a row? </p>
<p> Log each individual play as a play, so 3 plays logged. </p>
<p> Log the session as a play, so 1 play logged. </p>
<p> Which types of games should I log? </p>
<p> Face-to-face (almost everyone would log these) </p>
<p> Each day I played it (most people wouldn't do this) </p>
<p> What about expansions? (There's really no clear consensus on this question.) </p>
<p> Only log base games </p>
<p> Only log the expansion </p>
<p> Log the expansion and the base game </p>
<p> Log the base game, and use a hack to log the expansion as a fractional e.g. 0.1 or 0.01 </p>
<p> Decide for yourself what your logging goals are and choose a personal policy accordingly. Is a game against AI players just as meaningful for you as a game against humans? Do you want your total number of plays per month to equal the number of times you played a game that month, or do you want each game and expansion to show how many times you played it? Is it easier for you to remember to log a long game the day it begins or the day it ends? Etc. </p>
<p> Expansions are complicated </p>
<p> People often propose that BGG should automatically link expansions to "the" base game they expand, so they can log the expansion and have it automatically log the base game for them. But: </p>
<p> What if you log 2 different expansions of the same base game? How does the system know whether you played the game 2 times, once with each expansion, or one time with both expansions? </p>
<p> Some games can be played on their own or as an expansion to another, e.g. Dominion: Intrigue can be played on its own or as an expansion to Dominion. </p>

<p> Play was a Swedish pop girl group. Faye Hamlin, Anna Sundstrand, Anaïs Lameche, and Rosie Munter formed Play's original lineup from the band's formation from 2000 until late 2003. After founding member Faye left the group, fifth member Janet Leon joined Play to fill Hamlin's position as lead singer.[1] In 2005, the group officially announced an "indefinite break" and split up.[2] At that time, Play had sold almost one million albums.[3] Four years later, in 2009, the group reformed with a new lineup of three members consisting of Anaïs, Faye, and the sixth and oldest member of Play, Sanne Karlsson. In February 2011, an official statement was made that Faye had once again left the group in 2010 and would be replaced by Emelie Norenberg.[4] It was announced in May 2011 that the band had separated for the second time. </p>
<p> Play was formed in late 2000 as a result of a nationwide talent search led by Laila Bagge, a recording artist and dance studio owner. Her original lineup for Play consisted of four girls. Two girls were discovered at her dance studio: eleven-year-old Anna Sundstrand and thirteen-year-old Anaïs Lameche, younger sister of recording artist Amanda Lameche. The other two girls were found in the audition process: thirteen-year-olds Faye Hamlin and Rosie Munter, the latter of which had also starred in a popular Swedish film called Eva och Adam. Faye and Rosie had also been best friends before being selected to be in Play.[5] Play's career was launched both in Sweden and in the United States in 2001 and 2002. Their first single and video, "Us Against the World", was released in Sweden in September 2001. The song hit number 14 on the Sverigetopplistan chart, and was later certified Gold. The single was released in the United States in January of 2002, it charted at number 10 on Billboard's Hot Singles Sales chart and stayed on the chart for 65 weeks. The song also charted in France, and Germany. In Sweden, Play's first full-length English-language album, Us Against the World, was released on December 12, 2001. In the United States the album was released on June 25, 2002 and named as Play. In 2002 the group released the second single, "Cinderella". </p>
<p> Play toured in the United States in the coming months, opening for Aaron Carter and Destiny's Child. While touring in the USA they group often partnered with the girls clothing chain Limited Too. Play's song "M.A.S.T.E.R. part 2", which features Lil' Fizz of B2K and lead vocals by Faye, was also featured in the 2002 film The Master of Disguise, for which they filmed a video with numerous well-known soundtrack contributing artists including Lil' Fizz, J-Boog, Jhené Aiko and Solange Knowles. Their hit song "Us Against the World" was featured in the film Holiday in the Sun, and also on the Lizzie McGuire series soundtrack. The girls of Play concluded 2002 with an appearance on the nationally televised Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in which they stood atop the Build-a-Bear float. They performed a rendition of "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me" which they had previously recorded with Chris Trousdale of Dream Street. The album peaked at number seventy-four on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold on March 24, 2003 for sales of 500,000 copies.[6][7] </p>
<p> Play returned to the studio to begin recording their second album, Replay. Prior to the release of their second album, a DVD titled Playin' Around was released and featured several Play music videos, special "Making of" segments, footage from a live concert, and clips of the members from Play recording and preparing for their second album. Replay, a more mature and R&B-influenced effort, was released on June 10, 2003. On the day of release, Play made several appearances to promote the album, including a guest spot on popular daytime talk show Live with Regis and Kelly. During the Replay era, Faye emerged as the group's lead singer. The album debuted at number sixty-seven and managed to stay in the top 200 albums for seven weeks.[8] The first single was "I Must Not Chase the Boys" and the music video made was aired on MTV's TRL and made the top 10 requested videos countdown. It also managed to be featured on Carson Daly's radio show as one of his picks of the week. The song was also used for a promo for the Nickelodeon cartoon My Life As A Teenage Robot. Play continued to tour in 2003 and they also appeared on several Nickelodeon television specials as featured guests and performers. The group also released the second and final single from Replay, a cover of Atomic Kitten's "Whole Again". </p>
<p> In October 2003, Play's lead singer, sixteen-year-old Faye Hamlin, decided to leave Play to pursue a college education. Faye continued to make appearances with Play until December 2003, and appeared in Play's video "It's a Hard Knock Life" which was featured on a DVD re-release of the hit musical film Annie. On December 15, a formal press release on the group's official site informed fans of the lineup change and introduced new member, Janet Leon, who would become Play's new lead singer along with Anaïs. </p>
<p> 2004–05: Don't Stop the Music, Play Around the Christmas Tree and split[edit] </p>
<p> Play's third US album, Don't Stop the Music, was released on March 9, 2004. The first single, "Every Little Step", featured Aaron Carter.[9] The album was aimed more at a younger audience and received a mixed reception by Play fans. Play became affiliated with Kohl's new clothing brand for girls called everGirl, recording a song as well as a video to promote this new clothing line. The title track from the album Don't Stop the Music was originally written and recorded by Swedish singer Robyn. The album is one of Play's worst selling albums, failing to chart on Billboard. The second single was "everGirl". </p>
<p> In November 2004, Play released their fourth US album, a Christmas collection entitled Play Around the Christmas Tree. The album also failed to chart on the Billboard 200, and is their other worst selling album. Little news of Play was heard until the release of their compilation album entitled Girl's Mind which was released in April 2005. The album features ten of Play's best-known songs, and all feature Faye's vocals. Play never came to the US to promote Girl's Mind, and it was not widely released in stores across the country. It was their third consecutive album also failing to chart on Billboard 200. After a long period of no activity, in September 2005 an official statement from the members of Play confirmed that they were on an indefinite break as a group. At that time, Play had sold almost one million albums.[3] </p>
<p> 2009–11: Reunion, Under My Skin and second split[edit] </p>
<p> On November 26, 2009, Faye and Anaïs appeared on the Swedish radio stations NRJ and RIXFM, along with another singer named Sanne Karlsson. They then announced as a trio, they would return as "Play" and were to partake in the filming of reality show Made in Sweden just like former member Janet was.[10] Anna was not included in the reunion due to living in the United States.[11] Rosie was originally to be in the reunion, but dropped out three weeks before filming Made in Sweden in order to pursue a solo career as a singer/songwriter.[12] This meant that Play had to find another member, which resulted in Sanne joining the group. With the new lineup in place, Play recorded a full album in four weeks and on November 27, 2009, Play made their first public appearance in over 4 years since disbanding in 2005. Made In Sweden aired in December 2009, and followed the girls searching for a new member, training, choosing and recording songs, recording the music video for "Famous" and following them on their journey to re-enter the music scene along with the Made In Sweden team: Andreas Carlsson, Anders Bagge and their old manager, Laila Bagge. The reality programme consisted of four episodes. In 2009, Play was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. </p>
<p> The lead single of their first studio album in six years was titled "Famous". It was the original theme tune for Made in Sweden the previous year, sung by Andreas Carlsson. There was some debate on whether to release "Famous" or "Girls" as the comeback single, but in the end "Famous" was chosen as the single. "Famous" debuted at number five, and in its next week peaked at number one.[13] It became Play's only number one single of all time. It was later remade by Big Time Rush for their TV show on Nickelodeon. The group's new album, Under My Skin, was released on April 21, 2010. It debuted and peaked at number seven on the Swedish Albums Chart, making it their first album to chart in Sweden. In October, Play recorded a song called "Destiny" for the Disney Channel Original Movie Avalon High. However, just before the girls were about to enter the studio to record the song, Faye called Laila Bagge and told her that she had once again decided to leave the group. Faye's vocals are therefore not present in the song. It was also announced that Faye would not be joining Anais and Sanne for the promotion of the song. The song premiered on October 26 on Radio Disney. Faye had not been mentioned in the group's blog, nor seen with the others since late September, and some were doubting her place in the band. Multiple sources stated that Faye was writing and recording a solo album, and more pictures cropped of Faye on her own. Due to the search of a new member, Faye's decision to leave the group was not revealed to the fans until February 2011, when Play announced that Emelie Norenberg, Sanne's best friend, who knew many of the other former members, would become the newest member of Play. This left Anais as the only original member of the group, and the only member to be in every incarnation of the group. </p>
<p> Anaïs, Sanne and Emelie were planning a return to the United States and release an EP. But, on 23 May 2011, it was announced after a lack of news, that the plans that were made for the group would not happen and that the group had broken up for a second and final time. The band split up in early 2011. Moreover, it was later revealed through an official statement that the members were no longer on speaking terms for a variety of reasons. The reason was apparently due to the girls not meeting after their trip to L.A. and some things were said about the commitment of some of the girls. They have each since gone their separate ways both professionally and personally. </p>

<p> Plays are performed at a variety of levels, from London's West End and Broadway in New York City – which are the highest level of commercial theatre in the English-speaking world – to regional theatre, to community theatre, as well as university or school productions. A stage play is a play performed, and written to be performed, on stage rather than broadcast or made into a movie. Stage plays are those performed on any stage before an audience. There are rare dramatists, notably George Bernard Shaw, who have had little preference as to whether their plays were performed or read. The term "play" can refer to both the written texts of playwrights and to their complete theatrical performance.[1] </p>
<p> Comedies are plays which are designed to be humorous. Comedies are often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain comedies are geared toward different age groups. Comedies were one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece, along with tragedies. An example of a comedy would be William Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream, or for a more modern example the skits from Saturday Night Live.[2][3] </p>
<p> A generally nonsensical genre of play, farces are often acted and often involve humor. An example of a farce includes William Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors, or Mark Twain's play Is He Dead?. </p>
<p> A satire play takes a comic look at current events, while at the same time attempting to make a political or social statement, for example pointing out corruption. An example of a satire would be Nikolai Gogol's The Government Inspector and Aristophanes' Lysistrata. Satire plays are generally one of the most popular forms of comedy, and often considered to be their own genre entirely. </p>
<p> Restoration comedy is a genre that explored relationships between men and women, and was considered risqué in its time.[4] Characters featured in restoration comedy included stereotypes of all kinds, and these same stereotypes were found in most plays of this genre, so much so that most plays were very similar in message and content. However, since restoration comedy dealt with unspoken aspects of relationships, it created a type of connection between audience and performance that was more informal and private. </p>
<p> It is commonly agreed that restoration comedy has origins in Molière’s theories of comedy, but differs in intention and tone.[5] The inconsistency between restoration comedy’s morals and the morals of the era is something that often arises during the study of this genre. This may give clues as to why, despite its original success, restoration comedy did not last long in the seventeenth century. However, in recent years, it has become a topic of interest for theatre theorists, who have been looking into theatre styles that have their own conventions of performance.[6] </p>
<p> These plays contain darker themes such as death and disaster. Often the protagonist of the play has a tragic flaw, a trait which leads to their downfall. Tragic plays convey all emotions and have very dramatic conflicts. Tragedy was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. Some examples of tragedies include William Shakespeare's Hamlet, and also John Webster's play The Duchess of Malfi.[2] </p>
<p> An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, the British Museum, London </p>
<p> An actor and actress performing a play in front of the Nereid Monument, Room 17, the British Museum, London </p>
<p> These plays focus on actual historical events. They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. History as a separate genre was popularized by William Shakespeare. Examples of historical plays include Friedrich Schiller's Demetrius and Shakespeare's King John.[7] </p>
<p> Ballad opera, a popular theatre style at the time, was the first style of musical to be performed in the American colonies. The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called “The Disappointment”, however, this play never made it to production. </p>
<p> Modern Western musical theatre emerged in the Victorian era, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America. Around the 1920s, theatre styles were beginning to be defined more clearly. For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs. When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value. </p>
<p> By the 1990s, there were very few original Broadway musicals, as many were recreations of movies or novels. </p>
<p> Musical productions have songs to help explain the story and move the ideas of the play along. They are usually accompanied by dancing. Musicals can be very elaborate in settings and actor performances. Examples of musical productions include Wicked and Fiddler on the Roof. </p>
<p> This theatre style originated in the 1940s when Antonin Artaud hypothesized about the effects of expressing through the body as opposed to “by socially conditioned thought.” In 1946, he wrote a preface to his works in which he explained how he came to write what and the way he did. </p>
<p> Above all, Artaud did not trust language as a means of communication. Plays within the genre of theatre of cruelty are abstract in convention and content. Artaud wanted his plays to have an effect and accomplish something. His intention was to symbolise the subconscious through bodily performances, as he did not believe language could be effective. Artaud considered his plays to be an enactment rather than a re-enactment, which meant he believed his actors were in reality, rather than re-enacting reality. </p>
<p> His plays dealt with heavy issues such as patients in psych wards, and Nazi Germany. Through these performances, he wanted to “make the causes of suffering audible”, however, audiences originally reacted poorly, as they were so taken aback by what they saw. Much of his work was banned in France at the time. </p>
<p> Artaud did not believe that conventional theatre of the time would allow the audience to have a cathartic experience and help heal the wounds of World War II. For this reason, he moved towards radio-based theatre, in which the audience could use their imagination to connect the words they were hearing to their body. This made his work much more personal and individualized, which he believed would increase the effectiveness of portraying suffering.[8] </p>
<p> Theatre of the Absurd: This genre generally includes metaphysical representations of existential qualms and questions. Theatre of the absurd denies rationality, and embraces the inevitability of falling into the abyss of the human condition. Instead of discussing these issues, however, theatre of the absurd is a demonstration of them. This leaves the audience to discuss and question the content of the play for themselves. </p>
<p> One of the main aspects of theatre of the absurd is the physical contradiction to language. Oftentimes, the dialogue between characters will directly oppose their actions. </p>
<p> Famous playwrights within this genre include Beckett, Sartre, Ionesco, Adamov, and Genet.[9] </p>
<p> The term "play" can be either a general term, or more specifically refer to a non-musical play. Sometimes the term "straight play" is used in contrast to "musical", which refers to a play based on music, dance, and songs sung by the play's characters. For a short play, the term "playlet" is sometimes used. </p>
<p> The term "script" refers to the written text of the play. After the front matter, such as title and author, it conventionally begins with a dramatis personae: a list presenting each of the main characters of the play by name, followed by a brief characterization (e.g., "Stephano, a drunken Butler".) </p>
<p> A play is usually divided into acts, similar to what chapters are in a novel. A short play may consist of only a single act, and then is called a "one-acter". Acts are subdivided into scenes. Acts are numbered, and so are scenes; the scene numbering starts again at 1 for each next act, so Act 4, Scene 3 may be followed by Act 5, Scene 1. Each scene is set at one specified location, indicated in the script at the start of the scene (e.g., "Scene 1. Before the cell of Prospero."). Changing locations usually requires changing the scenery, which takes time – even if merely a painted backdrop – and can only be done between scenes. </p>
<p> Next to the text to be spoken by the actors, a script contains "stage directions" (not to be confused with the use of that term in blocking, the staging of actors with specified movements across the stage). The most common type is for the entering and exiting of actors, e.g. "[Exeunt Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.]" (Exeunt is the Latin plural of exit, meaning "[they] leave".) Other stage directions may indicate the manner of delivery of the text, like "[Aside]" or "[Sings]", or indicate sounds to be produced off-stage, like "[Thunder]". </p>

<p> Press to Play </p>
<p> March–May 1985 at McCartney's Sussex studios, and from October–December 1985 at McCartney's Scottish studios </p>
<p> Press to Play is the sixth solo studio album by English musician Paul McCartney, released on 25 August 1986. It was McCartney's first album of entirely new music since Pipes of Peace in 1983, and his first solo album to be issued internationally by EMI following a six-year alliance with Columbia Records in the United States and Canada. Keen to re-establish himself after his poorly received 1984 musical film Give My Regards to Broad Street, McCartney enlisted producer Hugh Padgham to give the album a contemporary sound. </p>
<p> On release, Press to Play received a mixed critical reception and was McCartney's poorest-selling studio album up to that point. Although it failed to make the top 20 in America, the album peaked at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart and achieved gold status from the BPI in September 1986.[1] Four singles were issued from Press to Play: "Press", "Pretty Little Head", "Stranglehold" and "Only Love Remains". "Press" was a minor success, peaking at number 21 in the US. The music video for the song featured McCartney walking around Bond Street and Charing Cross tube stations in London, catching a tube train and speaking with members of the general public. </p>
<p> After the box office flop of the musical film Give My Regards to Broad Street, McCartney decided that it was time for a change of pace in his solo career. In an attempt to give his music a more contemporary sound, he joined forces with Hugh Padgham, an in-demand, multiple award-winning producer famed for having recorded Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Genesis, The Human League, The Police, and XTC. McCartney began recording Press to Play in March 1985, having written several new songs, many with current collaborator, 10cc guitarist Eric Stewart who co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen songs. One additional song co-written by McCartney and Stewart was released as a B-side ("Hanglide"), while two more songs were later recorded by 10cc for their albums ...Meanwhile and Mirror Mirror. </p>
<p> McCartney recalled in 1986: "When we started working on the record, Hugh came in one day and said he'd had a dream. He dreamed he woke up one morning and had made this really bad, syrupy album with me, an album he hated, and that it had blown his whole career. We took that as a little warning".[2] Guesting on the album would be The Who's lead guitarist, Pete Townshend, Genesis' drummer and lead vocalist Phil Collins, Split Enz's keyboard maestro Eddie Rayner and Eric Stewart. Carlos Alomar also overdubbed electric guitar on several tracks, including "Press", "Good Times Coming/Feel the Sun", "It's Not True", "Tough on a Tightrope", "Write Away" and "Move Over Busker", according to his recollections included in the book Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969–2013).[3] </p>
<p> The album was not finished until the end of 1985, by which time only one song would see release from its sessions – the title track to the film Spies Like Us, joined by Phil Ramone in the producer's chair. "Spies Like Us", a non-album single backed by Wings' 1975 recording "My Carnival", was a US top 10 hit. </p>
<p> The album's cover features Paul McCartney and his then-wife, Linda McCartney. The album cover's photograph was taken by George Hurrell, using the same box camera that he used in Hollywood in the 1930s and the 1940s.[4] Hurrell was renowned for his photographs of movie stars of the 1930s and 1940s like Clark Gable and Greta Garbo, to which the album's cover was meant to pay homage.[5] </p>
<p> "Press", a slick up-tempo pop song, was released in July 1986 and went on to become the album's sole top 30 hit. Press to Play itself appeared on 25 August in the United States[6] and 1 September in the United Kingdom.[7] It received lukewarm reviews[8] and proved to be McCartney's weakest-selling studio album up to that point.[9] </p>
<p> Peaking at number 8 in the UK, its chart life was brief, while in the US, Press to Play failed to go gold, peaking at number 30 and selling only 250,000 copies.[10] The follow-up singles, "Pretty Little Head" and "Only Love Remains", performed poorly on the charts. As a result of this disappointing commercial reception, author Howard Sounes writes, McCartney appointed a former Polydor Records executive, Richard Ogden, as his manager, "to help revive his career".[11] </p>
<p> In 1993, Press to Play was remastered and reissued on the CD as part of The Paul McCartney Collection series with his 1985 hit "Spies Like Us" and an alternate mix of impending 1987 UK success "Once Upon a Long Ago" as bonus tracks. In this edition "Press" (4:25) was replaced by the 4:43 remixed version.[4] </p>
<p> AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine admired the track "Press", but gave the album a star rating of 2.5 out of 5, saying: "McCartney is dabbling in each of his strengths, just to see what works. It doesn't wind up as one of his stronger albums, but it's more interesting than some of his more consistent ones, and those aforementioned cuts demonstrate that he could still cut effective pop records when he put his mind to it."[12] </p>
<p> In a review for the Chicago Tribune, critic Lynn Van Matre wrote of the album: "No doubt about it, this is McCartney's most rocking album in ages. Much of it's catchy, most of it's fun, and it's superior to McCartney's efforts of recent years."[13] In the Los Angeles Times, Terry Atkinson praised "Press" as "a sprightly, sunny delight – one of the most playful, positive pop songs ever written about the joy of sex and its link with love", but opined that overall "the album finds McCartney as lost as usual and Stewart of little help". Atkinson concluded: "'Press to Play,' though it shows some signs of recovery, is basically just another in a long line (over 12 years!) of post-'Band on the Run' letdowns by a once almost unimaginably creative artist."[10] </p>
<p> More recently, Kit O'Toole of Blogcritics has contended that much of the album belongs among McCartney's "most ambitious work" and that the adventurousness of the project is unfairly overlooked. O'Toole adds: "Press to Play, along with McCartney II, arguably laid the foundation for his future musical experiments under the name The Fireman (particularly the first two albums, Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest and Rushes)."[21] </p>
<p> Bonus tracks: "Once Upon a Long Ago" produced by Phil Ramone, "Spies Like Us" produced by McCartney, Ramone & Padgham </p>
<p> Hugh Padgham – mixer except "Press" mixed by Bert Bevans and Steve Forward; and "It's Not True" mixed by Julian Mendelsohn. (And on CD reissue, "Once Upon a Long Ago", mixed by former Beatles producer George Martin.) </p>
<p> A^ Until January 1987, Japanese albums chart had been separated into LP, CD, and cassette charts. Press to Play also entered the cassette chart at number 21, and peaked at number 8 on the CD chart. </p>

<p> In this article I will outline several reasons for using role-play in the classroom and I will offer some tips for getting the most out of roleplay. </p>
<p> What is role-play? </p>
<p> Introduction Incorporating role-play into the classroom adds variety, a change of pace and opportunities for a lot of language production and also a lot of fun! It can be an integral part of the class and not a 'one-off' event. If the teacher believes that the activity will work and the necessary support is provided, it can be very successful. However, if the teacher isn't convinced about the validity of using role-play the activity "will fall flat on its face just as you expected it to" (Gillian Porter Ladousse 1987). Therefore, if you think positive and have a go, you may be pleasantly surprised! </p>
<p> What is role-play? Role-play is any speaking activity when you either put yourself into somebody else's shoes, or when you stay in your own shoes but put yourself into an imaginary situation! </p>
<p> Imaginary people - The joy of role-play is that students can 'become' anyone they like for a short time! The President, the Queen, a millionaire, a pop star …….. the choice is endless! Students can also take on the opinions of someone else. 'For and Against' debates can be used and the class can be split into those who are expressing views in favour and those who are against the theme. </p>
<p> Imaginary situations - Functional language for a multitude of scenarios can be activated and practised through role-play. 'At the restaurant', 'Checking in at the airport', 'Looking for lost property' are all possible role-plays. </p>
<p> Why use role-play? It is widely agreed that learning takes place when activities are engaging and memorable. Jeremy Harmer advocates the use of role-play for the following reasons: </p>
<p> It's fun and motivating </p>
<p> Quieter students get the chance to express themselves in a more forthright way </p>
<p> The world of the classroom is broadened to include the outside world - thus offering a much wider range of language opportunities </p>
<p> In addition to these reasons, students who will at some point travel to an English-speaking country are given a chance to rehearse their English in a safe environment. Real situations can be created and students can benefit from the practice. Mistakes can be made with no drastic consequences. </p>
<p> Tips on successful classroom role-play Prepare for success Role-play is possible at elementary levels providing the students have been thoroughly prepared. Try to think through the language the students will need and make sure this language has been presented. Students may need the extra support of having the language on the board. I recently did a 'lost property office' role-play with elementary adults and we spent time beforehand drilling the structures the students would need to use. When the role-play began the students felt 'armed' with the appropriate language. At higher levels the students will not need so much support with the language but they will need time to 'get into' the role. </p>
<p> The role of the teacher Some of the possible teacher roles are: </p>
<p> Facilitator - students may need new language to be 'fed' in by the teacher. If rehearsal time is appropriate the feeding in of new language should take place at this stage. </p>
<p> Spectator - The teacher watches the role-play and offers comments and advice at the end. </p>
<p> Participant - It is sometimes appropriate to get involved and take part in the role-play yourself. </p>
<p> Bring situations to life Realia and props can really bring a role-play to life. A group of my young learners recently played the roles of pizza chef and customer. A simple cone of white card with CHEF written on it took a minute to make and I believe it made the whole process more fun and memorable for the class. As soon as it was placed on their heads they 'became' the pizza chef and acted accordingly. </p>
<p> Rearranging the furniture can also help. If you are imagining you are at the tourist information office or at the doctor's surgery try to make it as real as you can. Students can even leave the room and make an entrance by knocking on the door. </p>
<p> Keep it real and relevant Try to keep the roles you ask students to play as real to life as possible. It may be hard for students who have little opportunity to travel to imagine they are in 'Ye Olde Tea Shop' in the heart of the English countryside. However, it may be within their schema to imagine they have been asked to help an English speaker who is visiting their own country. This may involve using some L1 to explain about the local culture or to translate local menus into English for the guest to their country. </p>
<p> Students working in the business world may find it easy to role-play a business meeting with colleagues visiting from abroad. If you are working with young children, try to exploit their natural ability to 'play'. They are used to acting out a visit to the shops or preparing food, as that is how they play with their friends. </p>
<p> Feed-in language As students practise the role-play they might find that they are stuck for words and phrases. In the practice stage the teacher has a chance to 'feed-in' the appropriate language. This may need the teacher to act as a sort of 'walking dictionary', monitoring the class and offering assistance as and when necessary. If you are not happy doing this and you feel that the process of finding the new language should offer more student autonomy, you could have 'time-out' after the practice stage for students to use dictionaries to look up what they need. </p>
<p> As mentioned in the role of the teacher section, feeding-in the language students need is fundamental. By doing so, they will learn new vocabulary and structure in a natural and memorable environment. It is a chance to use real and natural language. </p>
<p> Error Correction There are many ways to correct mistakes when using role-play. It is rarely appropriate for the teacher to jump in and correct every mistake. This could be incredibly demotivating! Some students do like to be corrected straight after a role-play activity, while the language is still fresh in their minds. Sentences with errors can be written on the board for the group to correct together. </p>
<p> Self-correction - If you have the equipment to record the role-plays either on audiocassette or on video, students can be given the opportunity to listen to the dialogue again and reflect on the language used. They may find it easy to spot their own mistakes. </p>
<p> Peer-correction - Fellow students may be able to correct some mistakes made by their peers. Students could be asked to listen out for both great bits of language they'd like to use themselves, and some mistakes they hear. Be careful to keep peer-correction a positive and profitable experience for all involved. </p>
<p> Making a note of common mistakes yourself and dealing with them in future classes ensures that the students don't lose motivation by being corrected on the spot or straight after the role-play. Negotiate with students and ask them how they would like to be corrected. </p>
<p> Use your imagination and have fun The most successful role-play I did last year was with a group of teenagers and was used as a spring board activity after listening to a song. The song was Avril Lavigne´s Skater Boy. The class worked in pairs to act out the scene of Skater Boy finally getting to meet his ex-girlfriend after the concert. The results were humorous and I was surprised that they all really got into the roles they played. </p>
<p> Role-play can be a lot of fun. If you still feel reluctant to use it in the class I suggest you begin to integrate it slowly. Why not extend an appropriate reading or a listening from a course book and turn it into a role-play? You may be pleasantly surprised by the results! </p>

<p> Shakespeare's plays are a canon of approximately 39 dramatic works written by English poet, playwright, and actor William Shakespeare. The exact number of plays—as well as their classifications as tragedy, history, or comedy—is a matter of scholarly debate. Shakespeare's plays are widely regarded as being among the greatest in the English language and are continually performed around the world. The plays have been translated into every major living language. </p>
<p> Many of his plays appeared in print as a series of quartos, but approximately half of them remained unpublished until 1623, when the posthumous First Folio was published. The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies, and histories follows the categories used in the First Folio. However, modern criticism has labeled some of these plays "problem plays" that elude easy categorisation, or perhaps purposely break generic conventions, and has introduced the term romances for what scholars believe to be his later comedies. </p>
<p> When Shakespeare first arrived in London in the late 1570s or early 1580s, dramatists writing for London's new commercial playhouses (such as The Curtain) were combining two strands of dramatic tradition into a new and distinctively Elizabethan synthesis. Previously, the most common forms of popular English theatre were the Tudor morality plays. These plays, generally celebrating piety, use personified moral attributes to urge or instruct the protagonist to choose the virtuous life over Evil. The characters and plot situations are largely symbolic rather than realistic. As a child, Shakespeare would likely have seen this type of play (along with, perhaps, mystery plays and miracle plays).[1] </p>
<p> The other strand of dramatic tradition was classical aesthetic theory. This theory was derived ultimately from Aristotle; in Renaissance England, however, the theory was better known through its Roman interpreters and practitioners. At the universities, plays were staged in a more academic form as Roman closet dramas. These plays, usually performed in Latin, adhered to classical ideas of unity and decorum, but they were also more static, valuing lengthy speeches over physical action. Shakespeare would have learned this theory at grammar school, where Plautus and especially Terence were key parts of the curriculum[2] and were taught in editions with lengthy theoretical introductions.[3] </p>
<p> Archaeological excavations on the foundations of the Rose and the Globe in the late twentieth century[4] showed that all London English Renaissance theatres were built around similar general plans. Despite individual differences, the public theatres were three stories high and built around an open space at the center. Usually polygonal in plan to give an overall rounded effect, three levels of inward-facing galleries overlooked the open center into which jutted the stage—essentially a platform surrounded on three sides by the audience, only the rear being restricted for the entrances and exits of the actors and seating for the musicians. The upper level behind the stage could be used as a balcony, as in Romeo and Juliet, or as a position for a character to harangue a crowd, as in Julius Caesar. </p>
<p> Usually built of timber, lath and plaster and with thatched roofs, the early theatres were vulnerable to fire, and gradually were replaced (when necessary) with stronger structures. When the Globe burned down in June 1613, it was rebuilt with a tile roof. </p>
<p> A different model was developed with the Blackfriars Theatre, which came into regular use on a long term basis in 1599. The Blackfriars was small in comparison to the earlier theatres, and roofed rather than open to the sky; it resembled a modern theatre in ways that its predecessors did not. </p>
<p> For Shakespeare, as he began to write, both traditions were alive; they were, moreover, filtered through the recent success of the University Wits on the London stage. By the late 16th century, the popularity of morality and academic plays waned as the English Renaissance took hold, and playwrights like Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe revolutionized theatre. Their plays blended the old morality drama with classical theory to produce a new secular form.[5] The new drama combined the rhetorical complexity of the academic play with the bawdy energy of the moralities. However, it was more ambiguous and complex in its meanings, and less concerned with simple allegory. Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare continued these artistic strategies,[6] creating plays that not only resonated on an emotional level with audiences but also explored and debated the basic elements of what it means to be human. What Marlowe and Kyd did for tragedy, John Lyly and George Peele, among others, did for comedy: they offered models of witty dialogue, romantic action, and exotic, often pastoral location that formed the basis of Shakespeare's comedic mode throughout his career.[7] </p>
<p> Shakespeare's Elizabethan tragedies (including the history plays with tragic designs, such as Richard II) demonstrate his relative independence from classical models. He takes from Aristotle and Horace the notion of decorum; with few exceptions, he focuses on high-born characters and national affairs as the subject of tragedy. In most other respects, though, the early tragedies are far closer to the spirit and style of moralities. They are episodic, packed with character and incident; they are loosely unified by a theme or character.[8] In this respect, they reflect clearly the influence of Marlowe, particularly of Tamburlaine. Even in his early work, however, Shakespeare generally shows more restraint than Marlowe; he resorts to grandiloquent rhetoric less frequently, and his attitude towards his heroes is more nuanced, and sometimes more sceptical, than Marlowe's.[9] By the turn of the century, the bombast of Titus Andronicus had vanished, replaced by the subtlety of Hamlet. </p>
<p> In comedy, Shakespeare strayed even further from classical models. The Comedy of Errors, an adaptation of Menaechmi, follows the model of new comedy closely. Shakespeare's other Elizabethan comedies are more romantic. Like Lyly, he often makes romantic intrigue (a secondary feature in Latin new comedy) the main plot element;[10] even this romantic plot is sometimes given less attention than witty dialogue, deceit, and jests. The "reform of manners," which Horace considered the main function of comedy,[11] survives in such episodes as the gulling of Malvolio. </p>
<p> Shakespeare reached maturity as a dramatist at the end of Elizabeth's reign, and in the first years of the reign of James. In these years, he responded to a deep shift in popular tastes, both in subject matter and approach. At the turn of the decade, he responded to the vogue for dramatic satire initiated by the boy players at Blackfriars and St. Paul's. At the end of the decade, he seems to have attempted to capitalise on the new fashion for tragicomedy,[12] even collaborating with John Fletcher, the writer who had popularised the genre in England. </p>
<p> The influence of younger dramatists such as John Marston and Ben Jonson is seen not only in the problem plays, which dramatise intractable human problems of greed and lust, but also in the darker tone of the Jacobean tragedies.[13] The Marlovian, heroic mode of the Elizabethan tragedies is gone, replaced by a darker vision of heroic natures caught in environments of pervasive corruption. As a sharer in both the Globe and in the King's Men, Shakespeare never wrote for the boys' companies; however, his early Jacobean work is markedly influenced by the techniques of the new, satiric dramatists. One play, Troilus and Cressida, may even have been inspired by the War of the Theatres.[14] </p>
<p> Shakespeare's final plays hark back to his Elizabethan comedies in their use of romantic situation and incident.[15] In these plays, however, the sombre elements that are largely glossed over in the earlier plays are brought to the fore and often rendered dramatically vivid. This change is related to the success of tragicomedies such as Philaster, although the uncertainty of dates makes the nature and direction of the influence unclear. From the evidence of the title-page to The Two Noble Kinsmen and from textual analysis it is believed by some editors that Shakespeare ended his career in collaboration with Fletcher, who succeeded him as house playwright for the King's Men.[16] These last plays resemble Fletcher's tragicomedies in their attempt to find a comedic mode capable of dramatising more serious events than had his earlier comedies. </p>
<p> During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, "drama became the ideal means to capture and convey the diverse interests of the time."[17] Stories of various genres were enacted for audiences consisting of both the wealthy and educated and the poor and illiterate. Later on, he retired at the height of the Jacobean period, not long before the start of the Thirty Years' War. His verse style, his choice of subjects, and his stagecraft all bear the marks of both periods.[18] His style changed not only in accordance with his own tastes and developing mastery, but also in accord with the tastes of the audiences for whom he wrote.[19] </p>
<p> While many passages in Shakespeare's plays are written in prose, he almost always wrote a large proportion of his plays and poems in iambic pentameter. In some of his early works (like Romeo and Juliet), he even added punctuation at the end of these iambic pentameter lines to make the rhythm even stronger.[20] He and many dramatists of this period used the form of blank verse extensively in character dialogue, thus heightening poetic effects. </p>
<p> To end many scenes in his plays he used a rhyming couplet to give a sense of conclusion, or completion.[21] A typical example is provided in Macbeth: as Macbeth leaves the stage to murder Duncan (to the sound of a chiming clock), he says,[22] </p>
<p> Hear it not Duncan; for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell. </p>
<p> Shakespeare's writings (especially his plays) also feature extensive wordplay in which double entendres and rhetorical flourishes are repeatedly used.[23][24] Humour is a key element in all of Shakespeare's plays. Although a large amount of his comical talent is evident in his comedies, some of the most entertaining scenes and characters are found in tragedies such as Hamlet and histories such as Henry IV, Part 1. Shakespeare's humour was largely influenced by Plautus.[25] </p>
<p> Shakespeare's plays are also notable for their use of soliloquies, in which a character makes a speech to him- or herself so the audience can understand the character's inner motivations and conflict.[26] </p>
<p> In his book Shakespeare and the History of Soliloquies, James Hirsh defines the convention of a Shakespearean soliloquy in early modern drama. He argues that when a person on the stage speaks to himself or herself, they are characters in a fiction speaking in character; this is an occasion of self-address. Furthermore, Hirsh points out that Shakespearean soliloquies and "asides" are audible in the fiction of the play, bound to be overheard by any other character in the scene unless certain elements confirm that the speech is protected. Therefore, a Renaissance playgoer who was familiar with this dramatic convention would have been alert to Hamlet's expectation that his soliloquy be overheard by the other characters in the scene. Moreover, Hirsh asserts that in soliloquies in other Shakespeare plays, the speaker is entirely in character within the play's fiction. Saying that addressing the audience was outmoded by the time Shakespeare was alive, he "acknowledges few occasions when a Shakespearean speech might involve the audience in recognising the simultaneous reality of the stage and the world the stage is representing." Other than 29 speeches delivered by choruses or characters who revert to that condition as epilogues "Hirsh recognises only three instances of audience address in Shakespeare's plays, 'all in very early comedies, in which audience address is introduced specifically to ridicule the practice as antiquated and amateurish.'"[27] </p>
<p> The first edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande, printed in 1577. </p>
<p> As was common in the period, Shakespeare based many of his plays on the work of other playwrights and recycled older stories and historical material. His dependence on earlier sources was a natural consequence of the speed at which playwrights of his era wrote; in addition, plays based on already popular stories appear to have been seen as more likely to draw large crowds. There were also aesthetic reasons: Renaissance aesthetic theory took seriously the dictum that tragic plots should be grounded in history. For example, King Lear is probably an adaptation of an older play, King Leir, and the Henriad probably derived from The Famous Victories of Henry V.[28] There is speculation that Hamlet (c. 1601) may be a reworking of an older, lost play (the so-called Ur-Hamlet),[29] but the number of lost plays from this time period makes it impossible to determine that relationship with certainty. (The Ur-Hamlet may in fact have been Shakespeare's, and was just an earlier and subsequently discarded version.)[28] For plays on historical subjects, Shakespeare relied heavily on two principal texts. Most of the Roman and Greek plays are based on Plutarch's Parallel Lives (from the 1579 English translation by Sir Thomas North),[30] and the English history plays are indebted to Raphael Holinshed's 1587 Chronicles. This structure did not apply to comedy, and those of Shakespeare's plays for which no clear source has been established, such as Love's Labour's Lost and The Tempest, are comedies. Even these plays, however, rely heavily on generic commonplaces. </p>
<p> While there is much dispute about the exact chronology of Shakespeare's plays, the plays tend to fall into three main stylistic groupings. The first major grouping of his plays begins with his histories and comedies of the 1590s. Shakespeare's earliest plays tended to be adaptations of other playwrights' works and employed blank verse and little variation in rhythm. However, after the plague forced Shakespeare and his company of actors to leave London for periods between 1592 and 1594, Shakespeare began to use rhymed couplets in his plays, along with more dramatic dialogue. These elements showed up in The Taming of the Shrew and A Midsummer Night's Dream. Almost all of the plays written after the plague hit London are comedies, perhaps reflecting the public's desire at the time for light-hearted fare. Other comedies from Shakespeare during this period include Much Ado About Nothing, The Merry Wives of Windsor and As You Like It. </p>
<p> The middle grouping of Shakespeare's plays begins in 1599 with Julius Caesar. For the next few years, Shakespeare would produce his most famous dramas, including Macbeth, Hamlet, and King Lear. The plays during this period are in many ways the darkest of Shakespeare's career and address issues such as betrayal, murder, lust, power and egoism. </p>
<p> Except where noted, the plays below are listed, for the thirty-six plays included in the First Folio of 1623, according to the order in which they appear there, with two plays that were not included (Pericles, Prince of Tyre and The Two Noble Kinsmen) being added at the end of the list of comedies and Edward III at the end of the list of histories. </p>
<p> Note: Plays marked with LR are now commonly referred to as the "late romances". Plays marked with PP are sometimes referred to as the "problem plays". The three plays marked with FF were not included in the First Folio. </p>
<p> Like most playwrights of his period, Shakespeare did not always write alone, and a number of his plays were collaborative, although the exact number is open to debate. Some of the following attributions, such as for The Two Noble Kinsmen, have well-attested contemporary documentation; others, such as for Titus Andronicus, remain more controversial and are dependent on linguistic analysis by modern scholars. </p>
<p> Cardenio (a lost play or one that survives only as a later adaptation, Double Falsehood) – Contemporaneous reports suggest that Shakespeare collaborated with John Fletcher. </p>
<p> Cymbeline – The Yale Shakespeare suggests that a collaborator may have been responsible for parts or all of Act III scene 7 and Act V scene 2 </p>
<p> Edward III – Brian Vickers concluded that the play was 40% Shakespeare and 60% Thomas Kyd. </p>
<p> Henry VI, Part 1 – Some scholars argue that Shakespeare wrote less than 20% of the text. </p>
<p> Henry VIII – Generally considered a collaboration between Shakespeare and Fletcher. </p>
<p> Macbeth – Thomas Middleton may have revised this tragedy in 1615 to incorporate extra musical sequences. </p>
<p> Timon of Athens – May have resulted from collaboration between Shakespeare and Middleton. </p>
<p> Love's Labour's Won – A late sixteenth-century writer, Francis Meres, and a bookseller's list both include this title among Shakespeare's recent works, but no play of this title has survived. It may have become lost, or it may represent an alternative title of one of the plays listed above, such as Much Ado About Nothing or All's Well That Ends Well. </p>
<p> Cardenio – Attributed to William Shakespeare and John Fletcher in a Stationers' Register entry of 1653 (alongside a number of erroneous attributions), and often believed to have been re-worked from a subplot in Cervantes' Don Quixote. In 1727, Lewis Theobald produced a play he called Double Falshood, which he claimed to have adapted from three manuscripts of a lost play by Shakespeare that he did not name. Double Falshood does re-work the Cardenio story, but modern scholarship has not established with certainty whether Double Falshood includes fragments of Shakespeare's lost play. </p>
<p> Note: For a comprehensive account of plays possibly by Shakespeare or in part by Shakespeare, see the separate entry on the Shakespeare Apocrypha. </p>
<p> Arden of Faversham – The middle portion of the play (scenes 4–9) may have been written by Shakespeare. </p>
<p> Edmund Ironside – Contains numerous words first used by Shakespeare, and, if by him, is perhaps his first play. </p>
<p> Sir Thomas More – A collaborative work by several playwrights, including Shakespeare. There is a "growing scholarly consensus"[31] that Shakespeare was called in to re-write a contentious scene in the play and that "Hand D" in the surviving manuscript is that of Shakespeare himself.[32] </p>
<p> The Spanish Tragedy – Additional passages included in the fourth quarto, including the "painter scene", are likely to have been written by him.[33] </p>
<p> Unlike his contemporary Ben Jonson, Shakespeare did not have direct involvement in publishing his plays and produced no overall authoritative version of his plays before he died. As a result, the problem of identifying what Shakespeare actually wrote is a major concern for most modern editions. </p>
<p> One of the reasons there are textual problems is that there was no copyright of writings at the time. As a result, Shakespeare and the playing companies he worked with did not distribute scripts of his plays, for fear that the plays would be stolen. This led to bootleg copies of his plays, which were often based on people trying to remember what Shakespeare had actually written. </p>
<p> Textual corruptions also stemming from printers' errors, misreadings by compositors, or simply wrongly scanned lines from the source material litter the Quartos and the First Folio. Additionally, in an age before standardised spelling, Shakespeare often wrote a word several times in a different spelling, and this may have contributed to some of the transcribers' confusion. Modern editors have the task of reconstructing Shakespeare's original words and expurgating errors as far as possible. </p>
<p> In some cases the textual solution presents few difficulties. In the case of Macbeth for example, scholars believe that someone (probably Thomas Middleton) adapted and shortened the original to produce the extant text published in the First Folio, but that remains the only known text of the play. In others the text may have become manifestly corrupt or unreliable (Pericles or Timon of Athens) but no competing version exists. The modern editor can only regularise and correct erroneous readings that have survived into the printed versions. </p>
<p> The textual problem can, however, become rather complicated. Modern scholarship now believes Shakespeare to have modified his plays through the years, sometimes leading to two existing versions of one play. To provide a modern text in such cases, editors must face the choice between the original first version and the later, revised, usually more theatrical version. In the past editors have resolved this problem by conflating the texts to provide what they believe to be a superior Ur-text, but critics now argue that to provide a conflated text would run contrary to Shakespeare's intentions. In King Lear for example, two independent versions, each with their own textual integrity, exist in the Quarto and the Folio versions. Shakespeare's changes here extend from the merely local to the structural. Hence the Oxford Shakespeare, published in 1986 (second edition 2005), provides two different versions of the play, each with respectable authority. The problem exists with at least four other Shakespearean plays (Henry IV, part 1; Hamlet; Troilus and Cressida; and Othello). </p>
<p> Shakespeare's plays continued to be staged after his death until the Interregnum (1649–1660), when all public stage performances were banned by the Puritan rulers. After the English Restoration, Shakespeare's plays were performed in playhouses with elaborate scenery and staged with music, dancing, thunder, lightning, wave machines, and fireworks. During this time the texts were "reformed" and "improved" for the stage, an undertaking which has seemed shockingly disrespectful to posterity. </p>
<p> Victorian productions of Shakespeare often sought pictorial effects in "authentic" historical costumes and sets. The staging of the reported sea fights and barge scene in Antony and Cleopatra was one spectacular example.[37] Too often, the result was a loss of pace. Towards the end of the 19th century, William Poel led a reaction against this heavy style. In a series of "Elizabethan" productions on a thrust stage, he paid fresh attention to the structure of the drama. In the early twentieth century, Harley Granville-Barker directed quarto and folio texts with few cuts,[38] while Edward Gordon Craig and others called for abstract staging. Both approaches have influenced the variety of Shakespearean production styles seen today.[39] </p>

<p> Solitaire Rules </p>
<p> The different piles </p>
<p> The Waste: The faceup pile next to the Stock in the upper left corner. </p>
<p> The Foundations: The four piles in the upper right corner. </p>
<p> The Tableau: The seven piles that make up the main table. </p>
<p> The setup </p>
<p> The Tableau piles are numbered from 1 to 7, pile 1 has 1 card, pile 2 has 2 cards and so on. The top card on each Tableau pile is turned face up, the cards below are turned face down. The cards that are left after setting up the Tableau are placed in the Stock, face down. The Waste and the Foundations start off empty. </p>
<p> The objective </p>
<p> To win Solitaire, you must get all the cards onto the Foundation piles. The Foundations are ordered by suit and rank, each Foundation has one suit and you must put the cards onto them in the order Ace 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King. To get there, you can use the moves described below. </p>
<p> Allowed moves </p>
<p> Flip cards from the Stock onto the Waste. You can flip either 1 or 3 cards from the Stock onto the Waste. The number can be configured in Options. </p>
<p> Move a card from the Waste onto the Foundations. If the top card of the Waste can go onto one of the Foundations then you can drag it there. </p>
<p> Move a card from the Waste onto the Tableau. You can move the top card of the Waste onto one of the Tableau piles. </p>
<p> Move a card from a Foundation back onto the Tableau. You can move the top card of a Foundation back onto the Tableau. This isn't allowed in all Solitaire versions, but we allow it here :) </p>
<p> Move one or more cards from one Tableau pile to another. You can move a face up card on the Tableau onto another Tableau pile, if that pile's top card is one higher than the moved card and in a different color. For example, you could move a red 6 onto a black 7. Or, if you have red 6, black 5, red 4 face up on one tableau, you can move all of them at the same time onto a Tableau with a black 7. If you have an empty Tableau pile then you can only place a king there. </p>
<p> You can flip a face down Tableau card. If you have moved a face up card from a Tableau pile so now the top card is face down, then you can click the face down card and it will be flipped and shown face up. </p>
<p> You can move a Tableau card onto the Foundations. You can do this manually if you need to clear some space on the Tableau. You can either drag the cards onto the Foundation, or just double click it and then it will go there by itself. When all cards on the Tableau are turned up, and all cards from the stock are finished then the game will automatically move all the Tableau cards onto the Foundations, since at that point you are guaranteed to win the game. </p>
<p> You can Undo as many times as you like. The game offers unlimited undos. Each Undo counts as a new move though, so if you're trying to win the game in as few moves as possible you should be careful about how many undos you use. </p>
<p> Time and Moves </p>
<p> The game counts the moves you make, and measures the time it takes to finish the game, so you can compete against your previous best games if you want. Currently there is no scoring like in the Windows Solitaire, if someone is interested in this then contact me at admin@cardgames.io and I'll see what I can do. </p>

<p> Here is the present tense statement of a future commitment: </p>
<p> The trio is to play at the museum's opening. </p>
<p> BE + {marked infinitive} is a way of expressing obligation or commitment. </p>
<p> When you arrive, you are to go immediately to the embassy. </p>
<p> There it can be paraphrased as "you must go". </p>
<p> The trio were to play at the museum's opening but cancelled when two of the musicians got the flu. </p>
<p> The sentence means: “Someone intended for Yo-Yo Ma to play that piece this evening”, Or perhaps, more specifically: “Yo-Yo Ma had intended to play that piece this evening.” </p>
<p> The phrase “was intended” is using the “passive voice”. The subject of the verb (the one who does the verb) is missing. </p>
<p> You cannot tell from the example sentence which of the above choices is the correct meaning. You have to guess from the other sentences (the context). </p>
<p> Passive voice can make sentences hard to understand. Even native speakers of English learn to avoid the passive voice when possible. </p>
<p> I don't agree with . To me that sounds incorrect and the sentence doesn't show any kind of relationship to . means 'to have as a plan or purpose' but there's nothing in the sentence that could point out that 'someone else' to have as plan or purpose for the subject. I see the sentence simply as – Alberto Solano Oct 15 '18 at 12:24 </p>
<p> I agree that it’s likely that Yo-Yo Ma chose the piece itself, but grammatically that is not required. Compare: “that is the piece I was to practice tonight, before my lesson tomorrow,” said the 10-year-old cello student as her beagle went running away with a shredded sheaf of sheet music in her mouth. – whiskeychief Oct 15 '18 at 20:44 </p>
<p> It was this very piece that Yo-Yo Ma was to play that evening. </p>
<p> Why the above sentence write "was to play" instead of "played" ? </p>
<p> Because the intention of who wrote this was to remark that there was a plan or a committent by Yo-Yo to play that very piece but then (I don't know the context), the plan has been cancelled or Yo-Yo got sick or something else happened. </p>
<p> You can translate the sentence in another way: </p>
<p> It was this very piece that Yo-Yo Ma was supposed to play that evening. </p>

<p> Storyline </p>
<p> Middle-aged chambermaid Hélène's newfound obsession with the game of chess leads her to seek the tutelage of a reclusive American expat, transforming both of their ho-hum lives in the process. —Palm Springs International Film Festival </p>
<p> Did you know </p>
<p> The film subtly suggests Hélène's improvement at playing chess through her opening moves. At the beginning, with her mentor, she opens by moving a side pawn, a move typical for inexperienced players who don't understand chess openings. Half-way through the apprenticeship, she opens with the king's pawn, the most widely used opening move, which shows that she now understands that chess playing is more than moving pieces and has an inner logic to be followed. For her last game with her mentor, she opens with the queen's pawn, a more complex opening which requires a better understanding of the dynamics of the game. </p>
<p> When Hélène first enters the hotel room where she will see the chess game, she unlocks the door and puts the keys back in her apron pocket. But when she enters the room, the keys are still in the door. </p>
<p> Hélène: When you take a risk, you may lose. When you don't take a risk, you always lose. </p>
<p> No need for my redundant review of this engaging French drama, driven (as the first-time director admits) by a desire to showcase the brilliant actress Sandrine Bonnaire, but the film's earliest scenes immediately had me wondering. Why didn't star Kevin Kline bring his better half Phoebe Cates with him to Corsica to play the enigmatic role of L'Américaine (portrayed instead by Jennifer Beals) in this film? </p>
<p> Like many a fan from the '80s, I've long awaited Phoebe's return to the screen (apart from the indulgent "The Anniversary Party" featuring her whole family with Kline), and here would be a perfect opportunity: just as Charles Bronson's wife Jill Ireland, after her own successful career, later appeared in roles of varying sizes in nearly two dozen Bronson vehicles, Cates would have been a showstopper here, not that Beals is deficient in any way. It would have at least taken away the cryptic nature of Beals showing up at all -with Cates we'd know why. </p>
<p> After this popped into my head during the first reel, I remembered that I had, by mere happenstance, had the pleasure of watching movies in theaters in NYC back in the '80s sitting next to both of these great beauties: at an Italian new filmmakers showcase held at the Quad Theater (Beals) and at a Times Square screening room (Cates). So I'm the Kevin Bacon, just like Kline, connecting the two, as trivial a fact as you will ever want to know or more likely not know about. </p>

Strengthening learning

education programmes

UNICEF, 2018

1. Introduction
The importance of early learning is entrenched in the second target of
Sustainable Development Goal 4, which seeks to ensure that, by 2030,
“all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care
and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education”.
Pre-primary education is now considered an essential tool for achieving
Universal Primary Education and the SDGs. Ensuring access to quality
pre-primary education is a key strategy for improving learning and education
outcomes as well as the efficiency of education systems.1

This brief will help pre-primary stakeholders advocate for making play-based
or playful learning a central aspect of expanding and strengthening the
pre-primary sub-sector. Grounded in a systems perspective, the brief offers
background knowledge and examples of strategies that could be adapted
to multiple contexts. The goal is to share practical ideas on how to embed
play and child-centred pedagogy in pre-primary education expansion efforts
to ensure the quality and appropriateness of these programmes.

The global momentum to expand and integrate early education services
into education systems has great potential. But it also carries risks, if
programming is not appropriate to meet children’s learning needs and
interests. It can be tempting to extend primary education ideas and methods
of teaching and learning down into the pre-primary level.

The brief describes the nature of pre-primary services within the broader
concept of early learning. We then share definitions of what is meant by play
in early childhood, followed by key points of why learning through play builds
lifelong learners and supports children’s overall development. We then note
the obstacles that pre-primary advocates may face when making a case for
play-based methods, and we propose a systems perspective in advocating
for child-centred pedagogy and playful programmes. Noting the unique
context of every country, the suggested strategies in this brief provide initial
ideas that could be adapted to local contexts.

One of the great challenges in education planning, therefore, is to
incorporate pre-primary education into the formal education sector while
retaining the distinctive elements of quality programming for young children.2
A key element to consider is ‘learning through play’, or ‘playful learning’,
which is central to quality early childhood pedagogy and education.3

The early years matter
Scientific research over the past 30 years has taught us
that the most important period of human development
is from birth to eight years old.4 During these years, the
development of cognitive skills, emotional well-being,
social competence and sound physical and mental health
builds a strong foundation for success well into the adult
years. Although learning takes place throughout life, in

early childhood, learning is taking place at a speed that
will never be equalled.5 The preschool (or pre-primary)
education years fall in the middle of the early childhood
period and lay the groundwork for success in school and
beyond.6 Although this brief is focused on the pre-primary
years, we note that learning through play is relevant
throughout the whole early childhood period and beyond.

How does this brief define
pre-primary education?

Conception to age 2

3 to 5 years

6 to 8 years

With adequate stimulation, a child’s
brain forms neural connections at
a pace of at least 1,000 per second.
However, recent indications are that
the speed could be up to 1 million
per second. These connections are
triggered by rich, loving and protected
environments, in the context of
responsive and playful caregiving
that foster bonding and secure
attachment, contributing to positive
socioemotional development.

Often referred to as the “preschool
period”. Children’s language, socialemotional and cognitive skills are
rapidly expanding. During this period,
the stimulation and learning that
come from play, reading, singing and
interacting with peers and caring
adults at home and in quality early
education settings are essential.
Play in the preschool years enables
children to explore and make sense
of the world around them, as well as
to use and develop their imagination
and creativity.

Often considered the early grades
of primary school. Play-based
learning continues to be critical,
yet it is often neglected in favour
of academic-focused education
approaches. Yet, in this period,
active, play-based learning
approaches can transform the
educational experiences of
children in the early primary
grades and strengthen learning
motivation and outcomes.

Pre-primary education is focused on support
for learning available to children in formal or
organized settings and programs. It typically
covers children three years of age until the start
of primary education. Under the International
Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)
Level 0 Programme categorization, pre-primary
education programmes typically focus on
interactions with peers and trained educators and
the development of logical and reasoning skills, as
well as introducing early literacy and mathematical
concepts and other school readiness skills.
The landscape of pre-primary education provision
is complex, with great variety of programs and
providers. Age of entry to pre-primary programmes
and how long such programmes last differ
from country to country.

Strengthening learning through play in early childhood education programmes Learning through play

Play, and why it is
important for learning
and development in
the early years
Educators are re-thinking how to teach young children
to tap their enormous learning potential. Play is
one of the most important ways in which young
children gain essential knowledge and skills. For
this reason, play opportunities and environments that
promote play, exploration and hands-on learning are
at the core of effective pre-primary programmes. The
next section of this brief explains what is meant by
play and play-based learning and gives examples of
the many ways in which children learn through play.

Play takes many forms
Everyone knows ‘play’ when they see it – on
streets, in villages, on playgrounds, in classrooms.
People from every culture, economic background
and community engage in play from their earliest
years. Yet play can be hard to define. Researchers
and theorists, however, agree on the key
characteristics of playful experiences, as seen in the
figure on this page.7 An important aspect of play
is children’s agency and control over the
experience. Agency refers to children’s initiative,
decision-making and self-choice in play.8
Ultimately, play should involve some degree of
agency, enabling children to take on an active role and
ownership in their experiences, as well as recognizing
and trusting children to be capable, autonomous,
and agents of their own playful learning journeys.

Play is meaningful
Children play to make
sense of the world around
them, and to find meaning in
an experience by connecting
it to something already
known. Through play, children
express and expand their
understanding of
their experiences.

Play is joyful
Look at children – or adults –
playing, often smiling and
laughing. Of course, play
may have its frustrations and
challenges (Who gets the first
turn? Why can’t I make this block
building stay up?), but the overall
feeling is one of enjoyment,
motivation, thrill and pleasure.

Play is iterative
Play and learning are
not static. Children play
to practice skills, try
out possibilities, revise
hypotheses and discover
new challenges, leading to
deeper learning.

Play is actively
engaging
Watch children playing,
and you will usually see
that they become deeply
involved, often combining
physical, mental and verbal
engagement.

Play is socially
interactive
Play allows children to
communicate ideas, to
understand others through
social interaction, paving
the way to build deeper
understanding and more
powerful relationships.

8 Learning through play Strengthening learning through play in early childhood education programmes

Children learn critical skills
and develop as they play

When children choose to play, they are not thinking “Now I am going to learn something
from this activity.” Yet their play creates powerful learning opportunities across all areas of
development. Development and learning are complex and holistic, and yet skills across all
developmental domains can be encouraged through play, including motor, cognitive and
social and emotional skills. Indeed, in playful experiences, children tap a breadth of skills
at any one time. Often this occurs during ‘corner play’ or ‘centre time’ in the context of
early learning or pre-primary programs. Corner play, when well planned, promotes child
development and learning competencies more effectively than any other pre-primary
activity. By choosing to play with the things they like to do, children actually develop skills in
all areas of development: intellectual, social, emotional and physical.9

Learning through play: More examples
Children at play learn how to:
–Make a plan and follow through [“I want to draw my family. Who will I put in
my picture?”]
–Learn from trial and error, using imagination and problem-solving skills
[“My tall tower fell down! Maybe my friend can help build it up again.”]
–Apply concepts of quantity, science and movement to real life [“I like
these big seeds. How many will I need to cover this part of my picture?”]
–Reason in a logical, analytical manner by acting on objects [“There are
still some pieces missing in this puzzle. Which ones might fit?”]
–Communicate with classmates and negotiate differences in points of view
[“I want to be the mother. Could you be the baby? Or maybe the grandmother?”]
–Derive satisfaction from their own accomplishments [“We did it together!”]
–Develop creativity and explore aesthetics and artistry [“I wonder
what will happen if I mix these colours together?]

For example, while children are playing, they can try out new social skills (e.g., sharing toys,
agreeing on how to work together with materials), and they often take on some challenging
cognitive tasks (such as figuring out how to make a building with smaller blocks when the
larger ones are not available). Children are ‘hands-on’ learners. They acquire knowledge
through playful interaction with objects and people.10 They need a lot of practice with solid
objects to understand abstract concepts. For example, by playing with geometric blocks
they understand the concept that two squares can form a rectangle and two triangles can
form a square. From dancing a pattern such as step forward, step back twirl, clap and repeat,
they begin to understand the features of patterns that are the foundation for mathematics.
Pretend or ‘symbolic’ play (such as playing house or market) is especially beneficial: in such
play, children express their ideas, thoughts and feelings, learn how to control their emotions,
interact with others, resolve conflicts and gain a sense of competence.11
Play sets the foundation for the development of critical social and emotional knowledge and
skills. Through play, children learn to forge connections with others, and to share, negotiate
and resolve conflicts, as well as learn self-advocacy skills. Play also teaches children leadership
as well as group skills. Furthermore, play is a natural tool that children can use to build their
resilience and coping skills, as they learn to navigate relationships and deal with social
challenges as well as conquer their fears, for example through re-enacting fantasy heroes.12
More generally, play satisfies a basic human need to express imagination, curiosity and
creativity, which are key resources in a knowledge-driven world. They help us to cope, to find
pleasure, and to use our imaginative and innovative powers. Indeed, the critical skills that
children acquire through play in the preschool years form part of the fundamental building
blocks of future complex “21st-century skills”.

10 Learning through play Strengthening learning through play in early childhood education programmes

Play is an essential strategy
for learning and teaching
Learning through play
in organized pre-primary setting

Learning through play at home
and in the community

Learning through play in the
early grades of primary school

In organized pre-primary settings, play experiences
are enhanced when children are provided with ample
time and space to engage freely with the pre-primary
setting/environment. Play can occur in many forms:
play with objects; imaginary play; play with peers
and adults; solitary play; cooperative play; associative
play; physical play. Play is considered children’s
“work” and is the vehicle through which children
acquire knowledge and skills, allowing children to
engage independently and with others. The role of
teachers and other adults in the room/environment
is to enable and scaffold playful experiences and
learning – this requires thoughtful planning (for
example, setting out materials to pique children’s
curiosity) and spontaneous interactions building on
natural curiosities and ideas (for example, following
the children’s lead in pretend play). Providing children
with active and playful hands-on experiences help
foster and enrich learning.

While this brief focuses on the systems approach to
integrate play in all aspects of pre-primary programs and
to ensure developmentally appropriate practice, we must
not forget that young children do not only learn in formal
or organized settings. The home environment and the
community are where young children spend the larger,
if not the largest, part of their early lives, interacting
with parents, siblings, extended family members, and
neighbours. These interactions and relationships have
a significant influence over how children understand
and experience the world around them. Indeed, home
environments and the community provide excellent
opportunities to promote learning through play from
the early years through pre-primary and primary years.
Primary caregivers, as children’s “first teachers”, are
the biggest supporters of children’s learning, and
therefore have an important role in creating the space for
learning through play. It is therefore essential to support
caregivers and empower them to take an active role in
shaping children’s learning and development, as well as
to facilitate playful learning for their children at home and
in the community in day-to-day experiences.

Learning through play is not only for pre-schoolers.
In the primary grades, play opportunities enhance
children’s mastery of academic concepts and build
motivation to learn. In fact, two of the most important
things that play can develop are interest and motivation.
Encouraging these in the early grades brings children
on board in contributing to their own learning. For
example, playing board games can strengthen math
concepts while building social competence. Book clubs,
dramatizing stories, and other reading games, make
it much more likely for struggling readers to move
ahead and not give up. Exploration of a wide variety of
printed materials and writing tools at a ‘writing corner’
can engage reluctant writers and help children learn
from one another. Further, play fosters creativity and
imagination, critical components in enabling us to cope,
to find pleasure, and to innovate. Play and opportunities
to engage actively in learning strengthens student’s
creative powers. Letting primary grade students engage
actively with materials, issues, topics, opens up the
space for inquiry and problem solving13.

A central tenet of learning through play
is bringing together the different spheres
of children’s life – home, school and
community and wider world, such that
there is continuity and connectivity of
learning over time and across different
situations.14 The adults in these spheres
have a critical role in facilitating this
continuity and connectivity of learning,
by recognizing, initiating, guiding and
scaffolding playful experiences, in support
of children’s agency. The continuum of
playful learning15 in Figure 1 shows the
different levels of child-adult involvement
in playful experiences – at one end, free
play gives children the freedom to play,
explore and discover; this progresses
towards more guided or structured play
with adult participation. Across this
continuum, it is important to ensure that
adults are equipped with the necessary
and appropriate skills to support learning
through play16 – even in cases of free play,
as adults need to recognize the benefits
of free play, and foster it by providing the
time and environment.

Obstacles to integrating play
into pre-primary systems
Parental or caregiver
misconceptions about play.

Why is learning
through play not
deeply integrated
in many countries’
pre-primary
programmes?

Many people, if asked, express
the belief that play is frivolous
and that play opportunities take
time away from ‘true learning’.
These misconceptions are caused
by a lack of understanding of
the benefits of play in children’s
education, with the result that
families might not demand
play opportunities in pre-primary
education settings.

Various factors
contribute to this:
Lack of understanding
of the value of play as
a foundation for academic
concepts.
Rote memorization and recall
of information remain the norm
in many settings. Education
officials and staff, as well as
administrators and principals,
may not realize the critical role of
play in building young children’s
understanding of mathematical,
scientific and literacy concepts.

Strengthening learning through play in early childhood education programmes Learning through play

Lack of teacher professional
development that focuses on
learning through play.

Curriculum and early
learning standards that
do not address play.
Many countries have curricular
standards yet they seldom include
play-based learning activities and
teaching methods. For example,
a review of Early Learning and
Development Standards of 37
countries conducted by UNICEF
revealed that only in one third of the
standards, the concept of playful
learning was well integrated.17
Furthermore, ‘play competencies’
are unlikely to be part of stated
desired outcomes for children’s
development.18

Many teachers are not adequately
prepared to implement play-based
learning in their classrooms. They
may think of ‘learning materials’ only
as workbooks or charts on the wall,
rather than objects that children can
explore and use in their learning.
Even if teachers see the need for
such hands-on materials, there are
often inadequate resources, and no
training to help teachers find or create
play materials with low cost-locally
available materials. Many teachers
have not seen learning through
play in practice and as a result lack
confidence in implementing in
their classrooms.

Large class sizes that limit
children’s freedom to play.
Finally, additional challenges exist when
classes are too large. When more than
30 children are in a relatively small space,
it is challenging to give children active
experiences with materials or even have
enough materials for all children. Large
classes also make it difficult for teachers
to support children’s play through
personal conversations and thoughtprovoking questions.

Removing obstacles
and moving forward
Because the pre-primary sub-sector
is so complex, a coordinated systems
approach is helpful to remove
obstacles and integrate play consistently
into programmes.
Simply tackling one challenge at a time will not work. For
example, if a country develops teacher workshops on the value
of play but has no guidance or curriculum expectations for
play’s place in pre-primary programmes, teachers are unlikely
to implement what they learned in workshops. Similarly, if
there is no effort to help families understand how their children
can learn by playing and to support them in promoting play
experiences at home, then the families might press for rote
learning, workbook pages and tests of abstract knowledge.
To strengthen and systematize efforts and initiatives in the
area of pre-primary education, UNICEF developed a conceptual
framework that emphasizes the complex nature of the
sub-sector and outlines key enabling factors in the policy
environment as well as five action areas that contribute to an
effective pre-primary sub-sector.19 Figure 2 presents a visual
summary of the framework and also highlights the guiding
principles of equity, efficiency, responsiveness as well as the
importance of coordination across national, subnational and
local levels of the sub-sector.
In the following section, we look at how each aspect of the preprimary system can foster play-based learning. For each area,
background and rationale are provided, along with examples of
strategies that promote play-based learning. These examples
are intended to encourage reflection and should be adapted to
meet countries’ needs.

Can a focus on
playful learning
be integrated
in the enabling
environment?
‘Enabling environment’ refers to the
broad set of interrelated national
political, social and financial conditions
that can either promote or hinder
the successful functioning of the
pre-primary sub-sector. A supportive
enabling environment is conducive to
recognizing the importance of learning
through play, and it can further
strengthen this emphasis by fostering
coordination with other sectors
such as health, nutrition and social
protection, which together can create
a unified voice for play in children’s
lives. The four elements of the
enabling environment, and how they
can foster play-based learning, are:

Policies and legislation
Policies specific to the pre-primary sub-sector
are important because they can clearly affirm
children’s right to play and can state that playbased learning is a distinctive and essential
feature of effective early learning. Policies and
directives can reflect a child-centred approach
to learning and teaching; such policies create
an expectation that playful learning will be
taken seriously and implemented across
levels of the sub-sector.

Public Demand
Support for pre-primary services among parents
and caregivers is key and it should be informed
by strong awareness of what quality means in
pre-primary education. Awareness-raising should
focus on young children’s unique learning needs,
e.g., the need to make meaning through playful
investigations supported by knowledgeable
teachers. A key aspect of fostering public
support and demand for learning through play
is to ensure that parents recognize their role in
providing meaningful play experiences in the
home environment, and to empower them to
do so. Garnering public support and demand for
learning through play will enhance the
pre-primary system’s commitment to
and recognition of the benefits of play.

Figure 2. Pre-Primary Sub-Sector Conceptual Framework

High-level leadership that is convinced or
aware of the value of child-centered and playful
approaches for teaching and learning can give
visibility to these issues and put pressure on all
parts of the sub-sector to integrate meaningfully
in their strategies and implementation plans.
Ministerial leadership can facilitate coordination
of this philosophy across sub-sectors as well,
promoting continuity between pre-primary and
primary education. Additionally, relevant child
development expertise across key arms of the
lead ministry and other institutions can validate
the importance of play in making pre-primary
learning effective.

How can playful learning be integrated into
the five Action Areas of the pre-primary sub-sector?
Each Action Area provides an opportunity to strengthen
the use of play as a core value of the sub-sector.
ACTION AREA 1

Planning for pre-primary
service provision
Providing pre-primary services that are available and
affordable to all families and their children requires careful
planning that prioritizes equity and ensure that children,
especially those who are most vulnerable, have equitable
opportunities to learn through developmentally appropriate
activities and materials.
Emphasizing learning through play as a pre-primary teaching
methodology has implications for the sub-sector’s financial, human and
physical resources. Implementing a play-focused vision also requires
regulations on class size that take this methodology into account.

Examples of strategies to ensure play
is a part of planning
Consider existing governance structures and the roles
and responsibilities of various stakeholders to ensure
that there is a shared vision around the value of play.
It is important to ensure that the value of play is recognized and
acknowledged by stakeholders across all governance levels and
ministerial branches. Pre-primary expansion planning, for example,

is often managed by planning officers in the ministry of education
(or other relevant ministry) while teacher training and curriculum
development is led by other branches in the ministry. Sharing a
common vision for the pre-primary sub-sector which includes learning
through play enhances coordination and planning across relevant
ministry branches to support its implementation.

When planning for expansion, consider human resources
needed to implement quality play-based programmes.
It is important to consider national, sub-national and local needs for
all personnel required for the delivery of quality play-based
programmes (e.g., sub-national and local officials, teachers, specialists,
supervisors, principals, technical experts, quality assurance inspectors,
building engineers, etc.). This involves planning for appropriate
class sizes and teacher-child ratios. Requirements for class sizes
and teacher-child ratios should be based on the number of children
a teacher can effectively support using active, play-based learning
methods. A recommended class size is no more than 25 children with
one teacher and one assistant.
However, the reality is that many current programmes do not meet
these recommendations. This makes it very difficult for teachers to
implement methodologies (e.g., language-rich conversations, indoor
corner play, etc.) that promote child development. Possible solutions
include dividing children into two groups (of 25-30 children each) that
rotate from outdoor to indoor activities under the supervision of a
teacher and community teacher assistant. This arrangement enables
25 children to have access to corner play materials, and small group
sizes for circle time, while 25 others enjoy outdoor play and a small
group activity such as story time with the community teacher assistant.

When planning for expansion, consider physical resources and materials
needed to implement quality play-based programmes.
Planning for physical spaces and equipment should follow child-centred principles.
Guidelines on room construction should reflect the need for large spaces to support
movement and interactions of young children. Thematic or free play corners/centres
should be available, as well as ample outdoor space to promote outdoor learning
activities.
An important policy-level planning activity is to ensure sufficient resource
allocations for play-based pedagogy.
Sometimes policymakers interpret ‘learning through play’ to mean that children do
not need any materials (e.g., textbooks) and conclude that money can be saved
this way. Advocacy can clarify that while many play activities are ‘free’ – and many
learning materials can be produced from local materials – a substantial inventory of
equipment and materials is required to support holistic learning and development.

Financing play
Financing for appropriate learning materials, equipment and professional
supports that promote play does not need to be costly but does need to
promote relevance and diversity in scope. For example, nationally relevant,
low cost materials can be explored as governments develop pre-primary
learning resource packages for each classroom. For example, in Senegal,
UNICEF supported the development of a local preschool classroom kit
of play and learning resources (modelled after the ECD kit for emergencies
settings) ensuring the use of local toys, games and other resources
that promote play.

ACTION AREA 2

Curriculum development
and implementation
Learning through play with stimulating materials is an essential feature of
pre-primary curricula, although specifics will differ across contexts
and cultures.
Curricula and pedagogy must respond to varying cultural contexts. However, a key
principle across all settings is that curricula should be developmentally appropriate. An
effective curriculum is well suited to the ages and the developmental, individual and cultural
characteristics of children. For pre-primary children, a curriculum that emphasizes exploration
and intentional teaching of key content through stimulating interactions and active, playful
learning experiences is likely to promote progress across all areas of development and learning.

Examples of strategies to promote play in curriculum
development and implementation
Ensure that play and/or active, child-centred learning and teaching
are a core value of national and local curricula.
Some written curricula describe outcomes and child competencies but do not specify
the methods or pedagogies that should be used to achieve them. For example, a national
curriculum may state that a literacy goal for pre-primary children is knowing the alphabet, or
that a math goal is knowing the names of geometric shapes. These goals may be valuable
and appropriate if the primary approach is learning through play; if the method is rote teaching
(simply reciting letters or naming shapes from flash cards), however, children will learn less
effectively and their engagement in learning is likely to be undermined.

Provide clear, user-friendly curriculum implementation guides
for teachers and managers.
To implement learning through play, service providers and teachers require user-friendly
curriculum guides that describe what to do and why. They also need training to use these
materials. Implementation guides should be supplemented with such resources as simple,

Strengthening learning through play in early childhood education programmes Learning through play

Developmentally appropriate
practice and playful learning
Developmentally Appropriate Practice
(DAP)20 is an approach to teaching young
children that is grounded in research on
how young children develop and learn.
The four key dimensions of DAP are:
Individual appropriateness: Children’s
varied personalities, learning styles and
family backgrounds influence how they
experience learning. Children also grow
at different rates, and some children have
learning difficulties or talents that shape
their progress. That is why group teaching
is minimized in DAP. Direct observation of
children helps teachers build on children’s
individual interests and abilities to help them
develop.
Age appropriateness: Evidence of
what is typical at each age and stage
of development helps determine which
experiences best promote holistic learning.
Play-based activities must be right for
a child’s individual development yet
challenging enough to promote progress
and interest.

Cultural appropriateness: Cultural context
and priorities also account for differences
in child development and learning priorities.
Getting to know children’s families and
learning about the values and expectations
that shape their lives helps teachers
provide meaningful, relevant and respectful
learning experiences for each child and
family. It creates a foundation for parentteacher partnerships.
Meaningfulness to the child: In early
childhood, children learn best through
play-based, hands-on experiences. They
make sense of ideas from real-life experience
(versus ‘telling’) and are motivated to learn
when something is interesting and exciting.21
Children appear to gain lasting academic
and social benefits when they spend part of
each day planning and directing their own
learning through play, rather than receiving
impersonal, direct instruction focused
specifically on academics, which may
discourage individual initiative. Self-directed
play with interesting materials and peers
in the presence of caring teachers appears
to foster confidence, independence and
concentration skills.

21

day-to-day implementation guides; training on the curriculum and teaching materials; and
ongoing on-site supervision and support. When curriculum training is combined with
implementation guides and resources, teachers gain the capacity to implement a balance
of teacher-guided and free-play learning activities.

Ensure an adequate supply of indoor and outdoor games, toys,
manipulatives and other learning materials that support implementation
of a play-based curriculum.
Pre-primary programmes cannot implement a play-based curriculum without equipment
and materials to support implementation. As noted in Action Area 1, effective planning
covers all resources required to ensure adequate materials, and yet when it comes to
implementation and ensuring these resources make it to classrooms, more bottlenecks
emerge. Like the curriculum, the materials and equipment should be culturally appropriate
and adaptable for use by children with and without disabilities. Outdoor equipment that
supports learning through play is also important and can take many forms.

Ensure that early learning and development standards, where they
exist, incorporate play features.
Early learning and development standards (ELDS) are a set of statements that reflect
expectations for the learning and development of young children, from birth to 8 years
of age, across several domains of development. Experience to date of countries who
have developed and/or implemented ELDS suggests that ELDS present an effective
entry point for embedding the value of play and child-centred learning into curriculum
practice. Many countries have used the ELDS to review or develop curriculum and in
some countries (e.g., South Africa), ELDS drove the first nationally applicable curriculum
to be used across the variety of early childhood education and development provision. It is
therefore opportune to leverage the ELDS, where relevant, to inform the curriculum.

Ensure that pre-primary curriculum includes strategies for families
to reinforce activities, skills and competences at home.
Primary caregivers are children’s “first teachers”, and therefore have a critical role in
supporting learning at home, as well as ensuring continuity and connectivity of learning
(as mentioned earlier), and it is therefore opportune to leverage this resource. Pre-primary
curriculum can therefore include strategies to involve families to support learning, such
as: take home activities that parents can reinforce; school meetings and conferences
that focus on building caregivers’ capacity to support playful learning at home; ideas for

22 Learning through play Strengthening learning through play in early childhood education programmes

games that can be replicated in the home, etc.

ACTION AREA 3

Pre-primary teachers
and other personnel
Facilitating meaningful playful experiences and learning
opportunities to promote holistic development and school
readiness is among the most important competencies
for pre-primary personnel.
Teachers and early childhood educators are at the heart of delivering
quality pre-primary services. Teachers need to understand the
importance of play and child-centred pedagogy in early learning, and
be equipped with the necessary skills and dispositions to put into
action play-based learning. Other education personnel – education
inspectors, training providers, specialized staff, and directors and
principals – must also be sensitized to and embrace learning through
play as an effective tool for supporting learning and child development.

Examples of strategies to promote play
through teacher development
Seek ways to bring more adults into children’s learning
experiences to support children’s learning.
It can be difficult for one teacher to implement play-based pre-primary
education. A second person in the room/setting, whether a parent
or another type of community teacher assistant, can make a great

difference for the teacher and the children. Assistants can work as
volunteers or for a modest honorarium. Having two adults in the
room/setting means that there is more support available to children
to experience free play or to engage in learning. It also means that
children – including children with disabilities – will experience more
personal relationships that will deepen their play experiences and
enhance their learning. Using volunteers or paid assistants effectively,
however, requires orientation and supervision.

Emphasize the distinctive work of supporting child-centred
pre-primary settings when selecting teachers for those
settings, and when setting goals for their professional
development.
Teacher selection criteria (and goals for professional development)
for a play-based pre-primary education environment should not be
identical to selection criteria for primary-grade teachers. Emphasis
should be on the attitudes and skills that enable learning and
development to flourish. Examples of these attitudes and skills include
physical energy and curiosity; willingness to try new practices and
willingness to let children shape some of their own learning; creative
skills; and willingness to spend time preparing materials and playful
activities. These attributes are also important when selecting and
mentoring teachers in the early primary grades.

Integrate learning through play and its benefits in
pre-service programmes for pre-primary teachers.
Pre-service education institutions need to develop specialized
programmes for pre-primary education that highlight play-based
learning and related teaching methodologies. In Zambia, the

Innovative approaches to training educators
on the value of play
In March 2017, South Africa’s Council for Education Ministers (CEM) launched an
innovative free on-line in-service training programme for early childhood educators,
entitled “Powerful Learning Around You” (P.L.A.Y.), and accredited with the
South African Council of Educators (SACE). The P.L.A.Y. initiative is a partnership
between the Department of Basic Education, the LEGO Foundation and Cotlands.
As a complement to existing and formal teacher training, P.L.A.Y. aims to reach
pre-primary professionals to strengthen their knowledge and skills to effectively
implement play-based learning, based on the country’s National Curriculum
Framework and National Integrated Early Childhood Development Policy, which
highlights play as quintessential ingredient of early childhood education. This training
programme is a creative example of how play can be integrated into the sub-sector,
fulfilling the goal of reaching, equipping and inspiring practitioners to adopt learning
through play, while achieving the vision of strengthening the inclusion and utilization
of play as a powerful tool and method of early learning and development.

23

24 Learning through play Strengthening learning through play in early childhood education programmes

Ensure ongoing training/professional development opportunities for
teachers to build practical skills on active teaching and learning and
play-based methodologies.
Ongoing professional development and user-friendly teaching guides are necessary
for strengthening teachers’ ability to implement play-based methodologies. Teachers
can also learn from their own and others’ practices. For example, monthly meetings
can bring teachers together to share reflections, brainstorm ideas for learning toys
and trouble-shoot classroom management problems with other pre-primary teachers.
In remote areas, social media such as WhatsApp can provide other venues for
sharing. Pre-primary teachers can become a bottom-up force for change when given
opportunities to lead these ongoing professional development meetings.

Tips for programmes

Simple training activities to help teachers
implement corner play
Education officials can lead by example when their curriculum plans include
resource allocations for workshops that train teachers to implement corner
play and produce and use play materials.
Teachers can be trained to implement corner play by playing with typical
materials found in each corner and then reflecting on the competencies
children acquire from exploring the material independently or with a friend.
It is also helpful to give teachers the time to make one or two games or
materials for each corner during a training workshop. This helps them get
a good start on setting up corners in their classroom and increases their
interest in doing so.
Workshops can also help teachers establish rules for orderly corner play
and care of materials (e.g., hanging string necklaces for children to wear
corresponding to the number of children allowed in the corner). Teachers
can also learn to help children when they wish to change corners: children
need to follow rules such as tidying up the area and telling the teacher
what they plan to do next.

Provide practical resources to support teachers’ and administrators/
principals’ understanding of the value of play.
Many pre-primary teachers/educators, as well as administrators and principals,
believe that children learn from the teacher through direct instruction, and that
play opportunities are a reward for completion of ‘work’. Teachers may also fear
loss of control. Teachers need training and setting-based mentoring to help change
their beliefs about how young children learn. Efforts to present the science behind
development and learning in a digestible manner to educators can pay off by helping
teachers internalize the information they are trained on. Instead of telling early
childhood educators, administrators and principals, that play is important, what helps
is helping them understanding why it is important. Resources such as a simple daily
schedule that builds in time for play, a good set of toys, games, and other handson learning materials can help teachers begin to manage a play-based learning
environment. When they see the results in children’s engagement and enhanced
learning, their beliefs, too, will change.

26 Learning through play Strengthening learning through play in early childhood education programmes

ACTION AREA 4

Families and communities
Collaboration with families and communities in the context
of pre-primary programs is key. When families are active
partners in children’s learning and development, a shared vision
for the role of play in pre-primary programs can emerge.
Primary caregivers are their children’s first teachers. They should be an integral part
of pre-primary programmes because they can contribute and also learn and apply
key strategies at home – it is therefore important to support families in becoming
equipped and confident to implement play-based learning at home. There are
many ways parents can stimulate child development through their nurturing
care, conversation and storytelling, and by teaching life skills and providing time
and materials for enriched play (e.g., pretending to ‘cook’ rice in a pot). Primary
caregivers (and other community members) can also contribute to the curriculum
at their children’s pre-primary centre. The traditional stories, crafts, games and oral
histories they share constitute hands-on learning experiences and ensure that the
pre-primary setting/ environment is culturally grounded.
Families who understand how much their children are learning through play – at
home and in the pre-primary programme – become community advocates. Their
outreach to reluctant families may be the most powerful means to ensure that
vulnerable children participate in pre-primary education programmes. Change is
often thought about in a top-down way: what government sectors or organizations
can do for people. However, people at the grassroots can reshape institutions by
promoting playful learning. The role of families and communities in supporting
learning through play also extends to the primary years to ensure continuity and
connectivity of learning across the ages.

Examples of strategies to promote play
in engaging with families and communities
Strengthen families’ understanding of the value of play, in pre-primary settings
and at home.
Families may not understand how much children learn from everyday activities; including conversation
and play. They may have little appreciation for play-based instruction and prefer what is familiar from
their own learning experiences – blackboard recitation and copying. One way to help families see the
value of play-based learning is to use simple means to help them understand how children learn. For
example, families can be shown photos of children building with blocks accompanied by statements of
specific math standards. Teachers can also hold discussion groups with families to demonstrate how
children learn through play. This can help families see the value of play as a learning tool. Sessions
might include: how children learn through play; providing time, materials and a safe place to play;
how to promote math and literacy through everyday conversation and play-based activities; and
keeping children safe at play. Families can also use everyday activities and routines at home, such as
preparing food, washing clothes and going to the market, as learning opportunities.

Engage families and community members in supporting a play-based approach to
learning.
When families and commuities feel valued and included as partners, they are more open to playbased learning. Inviting families and community members into the pre-primary setting to interact
with the children and to experience first-hand the process of learning through play is a powerful eyeopener to the benefits of play. Seeing active learning in action can help convince families that playful
experiences can build critical skills in ways that didactic methods and rote learning cannot. Families
and communities can also be encouraged to contribute to the curriculum, focusing on play activities.
Families and communities can also participate by contributing resources and materials to facilitate
play experiences (for example, a community sports center can offer its space for children to explore
physical play; families can provide cultural artefacts; etc.). Tapping into these partnerships helps
maximize the mobilization of support and resources across the systems and levels of the sub-sector.

Protect children’s ability to play safely by involving the community.
Communities constitute children’s immediate connection with the real world. Communities provide
additional resources, referrals and expanded services that can extend and enhance learning through
play, so it is important to identify and integrate community resources (e.g., community centres,
libraries, museums and playgrounds) to strengthen play-based programmes.

Tips for programmes

Engaging families and communities
in the pre-primary setting
Many programmes have a monthly event at which family
members or community experts are invited to the pre-primary
setting to share something they know about, or to lead an
activity with the children (for example, making play materials,
read-aloud with re-enactment, etc.). In a play-based programme,
these sessions can be opportunities to teach children traditional
games, songs, stories, dances or crafts that they can then
explore later during corner time (in pretend play, for example)
or on the playground and at home. This promotes hands-on
learning for children and it quickly becomes very popular with
the families and communities. Another strategy is working with
the community to create a school-community annual event such
as a storytelling fair or toy-making competition. These events
bring attention to what children can learn through
playful activities.

Play should be a central element of defining pre-primary quality.
Monitoring and quality assurance are central to ensuring continuous
improvement and identifying areas where additional supports
and resources may be needed.
Quality assurance assesses the extent to which standards, desired practices and
programme implementation are happening as intended. The goal of monitoring and
quality assurance systems is to lead to improvements to services and ultimately
policies. Because play-based learning is an essential component of quality preprimary programmes, it is important to include play-related components as part
of monitoring tools and quality standards. Even if ‘play’ is mentioned in a preprimary vision statement or curriculum, if it is not clearly present in standards for
implementation, then its impact is lost.

Examples of strategies to promote play
in quality assurance and monitoring
Ensure that quality standards for pre-primary education include
process-level indicators that capture features of learning through play.
Data collection in a pre-primary system needs to go beyond basic indicators on
access and inputs to include indicators related to quality and, specifically, the
type of learning and teaching happening in the pre-primary setting/environment,

including play (e.g., indicators on children’s engagement in free play and on
positive teacher-child interactions that encourage active learning). Monitoring tools
should note whether there are toys and other equipment and materials for play, and
whether the daily schedule has blocks of time for corner/centre play. In monitoring
classroom/physical environment quality, in addition to inspections, it is also possible for
pre-primary teachers and programmes to self-assess with simple instruments, recording
their own perceptions of strengths and areas for improvement.

Create a shared vision and ownership of quality standards across
pre-primary service providers.
Having quality standards that incorporate key features of active and child-centred
teaching and learning is a critical foundation of quality pre-primary programmes.
However, the mere existence of such standards does not necessarily entail compliance
or use. Service providers, including private providers, need to feel ownership of
standards. Various quality assurance and regulatory mechanisms (such as accreditation,
licensing, etc.) can help foster this shared vision and commitment to key aspects of
quality in pre-primary programmes.

When monitoring children’s outcomes, broaden the scope of
competencies and skills that are assessed.
Often, monitoring of child outcomes, where relevant, focuses exclusively on tests to
identify whether pre-primary children have specific knowledge of isolated math and
literacy facts. These kinds of assessments do not identify the broader range of school
readiness skills that include social, emotional and life skills, nor do they cover approaches
to learning, curiosity, team work, and other skills, even though these may be better
predictors of long-term success than isolated academic knowledge. It is important
to support teachers in understanding the value of formative assessment and using
observational methods that capture children’s learning through play and interactions with
others. Formative assessment methods provide more and better information about a
child’s development and learning support needs than test results.

Strengthening learning through play in early childhood education programmes Learning through play

Play across the humanitariandevelopment continuum
While this brief focuses on building pre-primary
systems that value play and that can implement
robust quality programs, it is important to
highlight that these same systems should
be prepared to extend services to children
in situations of emergencies and disasters.
Young children are prone to experiencing
“toxic stress” in humanitarian crises (including
human-made and natural disasters and public
health emergencies), a condition caused by
extreme, prolonged adversity in the absence
of a supportive network of adults and positive
stimulation. As such, humanitarian response
must support their psychological, emotional
and cognitive health and development and
protect their future potential. Children affected
by crises more than ever need a safe place
to play and learn. Opportunities to play in an
emergency context not only keeps children safe,
but also provides comfort to children and helps
them return to the routine and normalcy of
being a child.
While regular pre-primary services may be
put on hold during a humanitarian response,
there are alternative ways to ensure children
have access to safe learning spaces and play
materials/activities. Children’s learning

environments can be enriched with locallyproduced toys and materials that are informed
by their communities’ traditional learning and
play context. When these are not available,
the Early Childhood Development Kit (ECD
Kit), developed by UNICEF, can be introduced
as a substitute to school, learning spaces and
teachers/facilitators to help children develop
skills and competencies for thinking, speaking,
feeling and interacting with others for children
ages 0-8. To the extent possible, the ECD kit
should be complemented by locally-made
materials. The ECD kit has the aim to strengthen
the response for young children caught in
conflict or emergencies by complementing
basic services (such as health and nutrition,
sanitation, hygiene, protection and education).
Some key ECD Kit items include: puzzles and
games; board books; puppets; art supplies; etc.
The use of the ECD Kit is one example of an
attempt to ensure that opportunities for play are
available for children caught up in emergencies;
but more concerted efforts are needed to match
play-readiness of children, local caregivers’
awareness of the importance of play, and
teachers’ ability to manage child-friendly
classrooms with large numbers of resourcedeprived children – with developmentally
appropriate props and learning tools.

4. Conclusion
This brief should serve as a starting point for reflection and advocacy work
that puts child-centred pedagogy at the centre of pre-primary systems. Policies,
pre-primary implementation plans, teacher training plans, resource allocations
and quality assurance strategies should reflect the growing evidence that active,
play-based early learning environments provide the most developmentally
appropriate critical foundation for success in school and beyond.

In addition, the role of families must be recognized by the system, and they should
be supported and empowered to actively participate in shaping children’s learning
and development through play – establishing partnerships with families to ensure
continuity and connectivity of learning across the spheres of children’s life (home,
school, community) is thus critical. This Advocacy Brief therefore proposes several
key recommendations:

Ensure that the value of
play for children’s development
and learning is widely
understood and enacted in
pre-primary sub-sector plans
and policies and reflected
in resource allocations.

Ministries of Education
should have clear standards
and statements that preserve
the unique play-focused,
developmentally appropriate
approach that is essential
to quality services.

Ensure that pre-primary
curriculum is developmentally
appropriate and anchored
in child-centred learning and
experiences.

Use quality professional
development initiatives
to provide teachers and other
personnel, including administrators
and principals, with knowledge
and skills that build capacity to
implement playful learning across
settings and for all children.

Ensure that teachers
have access to implementation
guides, equipment, and
other hands-on resources and
materials that are essential
for young children’s learning
and explorations.

Use collaborative
approaches, including
collaborative professional
development, to extend play-based
learning into the early primary
grades and beyond, using these
methods to foster engagement
and build academic competence.

Cultivate and strengthen
the demand and support
(from families, communities,
etc.) for play-based learning.

Create a shared vision
around quality standards
that focus on and capture
learning through play.

Create partnerships with
families and communities to create
continuity in the experiences
of children in pre-primary and
home settings and to tap into
family and community resources,
including locally available materials
and the time of caregivers.

Broaden the scope
of competencies and skills
that are assessed to capture
those that are developed
through learning through play.

<p> The goal is to move all cards to the four foundations on the upper right. </p>
<p> Turning and Moving </p>
<p> Click the stock (on the upper left) to turn over cards onto the waste pile. </p>
<p> Drag cards to move them between the waste pile, the seven tableau columns (at the bottom), and the four foundations. You can also double-click cards instead of dragging them to a foundation. </p>
<p> You may move single cards or piles of cards within the tableau. You may only move cards off the waste pile, but you may onto and off the foundations. </p>
<p> Any time you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that card is automatically turned face-up for you. </p>
<p> Build Rules </p>
<p> Cards on the foundations need to be stacked by the same suit from Ace to King. </p>
<p> Cards on the tableau need to be stacked by alternating color from high rank (King) to low rank (Ace). Empty spots on the tableau can be filled with a King of any suit. </p>
