 
 Ebola virus disease (EVD), or simply Ebola, is a viral haemorrhagic fever of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses. 
 Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches. 
 At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally and externally. 
 The disease has a high risk of death, killing 25% to 90% of those infected, with an average of about 50%. 
 This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to 16 days after symptoms appear.The virus spreads through direct contact with body fluids, such as blood from infected humans or other animals. 
 Spread of the disease through the air between primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions. 
 Semen or breast milk of a person after recovery from EVD may carry the virus for several weeks to months. 
 Fruit bats are believed to be the normal carrier in nature, able to spread the virus without being affected by it. 
 Other diseases such as malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers may resemble EVD. 
 Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services and community engagement. 
 Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution. 
 Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans by handling potentially infected bushmeat only while wearing protective clothing, and by thoroughly cooking bushmeat before eating it. 
 It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease. 
 An Ebola vaccine was approved in the United States in December 2019. 
 While there is no approved treatment for Ebola as of 2019, two treatments (REGN-EB3 and mAb114) are associated with improved outcomes. 
 This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms.The disease was first identified in 1976, in two simultaneous outbreaks: one in Nzara (a town in South Sudan) and the other in Yambuku (Democratic Republic of the Congo), a village near the Ebola River from which the disease takes its name. 
 EVD outbreaks occur intermittently in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa. 
 Between 1976 and 2013, the World Health Organization reports 24 outbreaks involving 2,387 cases with 1,590 deaths. 
 The largest outbreak to date was the epidemic in West Africa, which occurred from December 2013 to January 2016, with 28,646 cases and 11,323 deaths. 
 Other outbreaks in Africa began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 2017, and 2018. 
 In July 2019, the World Health Organization declared the Congo Ebola outbreak a world health emergency.Signs and symptomsOnsetThe length of time between exposure to the virus and the development of symptoms (incubation period) is between two and 21 days, and usually between four and ten days. 
 However, recent estimates based on mathematical models predict that around 5% of cases may take greater than 21 days to develop.Symptoms usually begin with a sudden influenza-like stage characterised by feeling tired, fever, weakness, decreased appetite, muscular pain, joint pain, headache, and sore throat. 
 In about half of the cases, the skin may develop a maculopapular rash, a flat red area covered with small bumps, five to seven days after symptoms begin.BleedingIn some cases, internal and external bleeding may occur. 
 This typically begins five to seven days after the first symptoms. 
 All infected people show some decreased blood clotting. 
 This may cause vomiting blood, coughing up of blood, or blood in stool. 
 The incidence of bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract was reported to be ~58% in the 2001 outbreak in Gabon, but in the 2014-15 outbreak in the US it was ~18%, possibly due to improved prevention of disseminated intravascular coagulation.Recovery and deathRecovery may begin between seven and 14 days after first symptoms. 
 Death, if it occurs, follows typically six to sixteen days from first symptoms and is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss. 
 In general, bleeding often indicates a worse outcome, and blood loss may result in death. 
 People are often in a coma near the end of life.Those who survive often have ongoing muscular and joint pain, liver inflammation, and decreased hearing, and may have continued tiredness, continued weakness, decreased appetite, and difficulty returning to pre-illness weight. 
 Problems with vision may develop.Survivors develop antibodies against Ebola that last at least 10 years, but it is unclear whether they are immune to additional infections.CauseEVD in humans is caused by four of five viruses of the genus Ebolavirus. 
 The four are Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Taï Forest virus (TAFV) and one simply called Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly Zaire Ebola virus). 
 EBOV, species Zaire ebolavirus, is the most dangerous of the known EVD-causing viruses, and is responsible for the largest number of outbreaks. 
 The fifth virus, Reston virus (RESTV), is not thought to cause disease in humans, but has caused disease in other primates. 
 All five viruses are closely related to marburgviruses.VirologyEbolaviruses contain single-stranded, non-infectious RNA genomes. 
 The genomes of the five different ebolaviruses (BDBV, EBOV, RESTV, SUDV and TAFV) differ in sequence and the number and location of gene overlaps. 
 This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to cellular proteins enabling it to fuse with internal cellular membranes and release the viral nucleocapsid. 
 The Ebolavirus structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells. 
 The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the L gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. 
 The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the host cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. 
 Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny. 
 The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.TransmissionIt is believed that between people, Ebola disease spreads only by direct contact with the blood or other body fluids of a person who has developed symptoms of the disease. 
 Body fluids that may contain Ebola viruses include saliva, mucus, vomit, feces, sweat, tears, breast milk, urine and semen. 
 The WHO states that only people who are very sick are able to spread Ebola disease in saliva, and whole virus has not been reported to be transmitted through sweat. 
 Most people spread the virus through blood, feces and vomit. 
 Entry points for the virus include the nose, mouth, eyes, open wounds, cuts and abrasions. 
 Ebola may be spread through large droplets; however, this is believed to occur only when a person is very sick. 
 Contact with surfaces or objects contaminated by the virus, particularly needles and syringes, may also transmit the infection. 
 The virus is able to survive on objects for a few hours in a dried state, and can survive for a few days within body fluids outside of a person.The Ebola virus may be able to persist for more than three months in the semen after recovery, which could lead to infections via sexual intercourse. 
 Virus persistence in semen for over a year has been recorded in a national screening programme. 
 Ebola may also occur in the breast milk of women after recovery, and it is not known when it is safe to breastfeed again. 
 The virus was also found in the eye of one patient in 2014, two months after it was cleared from his blood. 
 Otherwise, people who have recovered are not infectious.The potential for widespread infections in countries with medical systems capable of observing correct medical isolation procedures is considered low. 
 Usually when someone has symptoms of the disease, they are unable to travel without assistance.Dead bodies remain infectious; thus, people handling human remains in practices such as traditional burial rituals or more modern processes such as embalming are at risk. 
 69% of the cases of Ebola infections in Guinea during the 2014 outbreak are believed to have been contracted via unprotected (or unsuitably protected) contact with infected corpses during certain Guinean burial rituals.Health-care workers treating people with Ebola are at greatest risk of infection. 
 This risk is particularly common in parts of Africa where the disease mostly occurs and health systems function poorly. 
 Some health-care centres caring for people with the disease do not have running water. 
 In the United States the spread to two medical workers treating infected patients prompted criticism of inadequate training and procedures.Human-to-human transmission of EBOV through the air has not been reported to occur during EVD outbreaks, and airborne transmission has only been demonstrated in very strict laboratory conditions, and then only from pigs to primates, but not from primates to primates. 
 Other possible methods of transmission are being studied.Airborne transmission among humans is theoretically possible due to the presence of Ebola virus particles in saliva, which can be discharged into the air with a cough or sneeze, but observational data from previous epidemics suggests the actual risk of airborne transmission is low. 
 Therefore, pigs with EVD can spread the disease through droplets in the air or on the ground when they sneeze or cough. 
 By contrast, humans and other primates accumulate the virus throughout their body and specifically in their blood, but not very much in their lungs.
